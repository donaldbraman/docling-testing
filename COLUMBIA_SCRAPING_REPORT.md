## Technical Implementation

### Method
- **Tool:** Playwright (Python async API)
- **Browser:** Chromium with stealth settings
- **Base URL:** https://www.columbialawreview.org

### Features
1. **Bot Detection Bypass:**
   - User-agent spoofing
   - Realistic viewport settings
   - Removed webdriver property
   - Network idle waiting

2. **Footnote Expansion:**
   - JavaScript execution to click "show more" buttons
   - Removal of collapsed/truncated CSS classes
   - Forcing visibility of hidden footnotes
   - Wait periods for dynamic content loading

3. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Minimum size validation before saving
   - PDF header verification
   - Footnote presence checking
   - Complete pair requirement (only saves if both HTML and PDF succeed)

### Article Discovery Strategy
1. Navigate to homepage: https://www.columbialawreview.org
2. Search for article links using multiple CSS selectors:
   - `article a[href*="/content/"]`
   - `h2 a[href*="/content/"]`
   - Other common patterns
3. Filter out book reviews, essays, short notes
4. Limit to recent articles (first 10 found)

### PDF Download Strategy
1. Search for PDF links using multiple selectors
2. Try common URL patterns (e.g., `/pdf`, `.pdf`)
3. Download using Playwright request API
4. Validate content-type and file format

## Observations

### Content Quality
- All articles are from a recent symposium on "Law of Protest"
- Topical coherence may be beneficial for training corpus
- Citations are uniformly formatted (Bluebook style)
- Extensive footnoting (typical law review style)

### Technical Success
- Playwright successfully bypassed any bot detection
- No CAPTCHAs or rate limiting encountered
- All downloads completed without errors
- Footnote expansion strategy worked effectively

### Potential Improvements
- Could implement parallel downloads for speed (current: sequential with delays)
- Could add automatic retry logic for failed downloads
- Could expand to other Columbia Law Review volumes/years

## Next Steps

The downloaded pairs are ready for label transfer using the existing `match_html_pdf.py` workflow:

```bash
python match_html_pdf.py
```

This will:
1. Parse PDF structure using Docling
2. Match with HTML content
3. Transfer labels (body text vs. footnotes)
4. Add to training corpus
