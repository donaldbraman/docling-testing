# Ready to Test! - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** 🎉 Everything fixed and ready!
**Active Instances:** ✅ ZERO (all destroyed to prevent charges)

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **SSH Parsing Bug** - Script was parsing disk space instead of SSH connection info
2. ✅ **ModernBERT Compatibility** - Added transformers from GitHub (requires 4.48.0+)
3. ✅ **Missing Git Dependency** - Added git to Docker image for GitHub installation
4. ✅ **Auto-Cleanup Feature** - Script destroys instance after completion

### Docker Builds:
- Build #1: ❌ Failed (no git) - 3m52s
- Build #2: ✅ SUCCESS! (all dependencies) - 4m0s

**Final Docker Image:** `donaldbraman/body-extractor:latest`
- Size: ~5-7 GB
- Includes: EasyOCR, PyMuPDF, Transformers (ModernBERT support), all dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run the Test

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Create new instance (search for good one first)
vastai search offers 'reliability > 0.98 num_gpus=1 gpu_name in [RTX_3060, RTX_3070] dph < 0.15 cuda_vers >= 12.0 disk_space >= 40 inet_down > 500' --order 'dph'

# 2. Create instance with ID from search
vastai create instance <MACHINE_ID> --image donaldbraman/body-extractor:latest --disk 40 --label "body-extractor-test"

# 3. Note the new instance ID (e.g., 12345678)

# 4. Update helper script
#    Edit run_test_when_ready.sh line 5: INSTANCE_ID="12345678"

# 5. Run automated test (waits for instance, runs test, auto-destroys)
./run_test_when_ready.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
# 1. Create instance (same as above)
vastai create instance <MACHINE_ID> --image donaldbraman/body-extractor:latest --disk 40

# 2. Wait for it to be running (3-5 minutes for 5-7 GB image)
vastai show instances | grep <INSTANCE_ID>

# 3. Wait additional 30 seconds after "running" status for SSH to be ready

# 4. Update and run test script
#    Edit run_classification_test.sh line 6: INSTANCE_ID="<NEW_ID>"
./run_classification_test.sh
```

## 📊 Expected Results

The test will process `antitrusts_interdependence_paradox.pdf` (54 pages) and generate 5 files in `results_classified/`:

### 1. Plain Text (`*.txt`)
Extracted text from all pages

### 2. Text Overlay PDF (`*_text_overlay.pdf`)
Original PDF with OCR text overlaid in yellow boxes

### 3. Class Overlay PDF (`*_class_overlay.pdf`)
Original PDF with colored class labels:
- 🔵 **Blue** = `body_text` (main article content)
- 🟠 **Orange** = `footnote` (footnotes and references)
- 🟣 **Purple** = `page_header` (running headers)
- 🟢 **Green** = `front_matter` (headings, captions, footers, cover)

### 4. CSV (`*.csv`)
Structured data with columns:
- page, text, target_class, class_confidence, ocr_confidence, x1, y1, x2, y2

### 5. JSON (`*.json`)
Full metadata including:
- Bounding boxes
- OCR confidence scores
- Classification confidence scores
- Original and target class labels

## 📈 Performance Expectations

**Model:** DoclingBERT v2-rebalanced
- body_text recall: 83.3%
- body_text F1: 84.08%
- Overall accuracy: 94.7%

**OCR Performance:** (from previous successful test)
- 54 pages in ~2 minutes
- 6,383 text blocks
- 83.25% average OCR confidence

**Total Runtime:** 5-10 minutes (including model upload)

## 💰 Cost Analysis

**Instance Costs:**
| GPU | VRAM | Cost/hour | Good for |
|-----|------|-----------|----------|
| RTX 3060 | 12GB | $0.05-0.08 | Testing, small batches |
| RTX 3070 | 16GB | $0.06-0.10 | Better performance |
| RTX 3080 | 12GB | $0.07-0.12 | Flash Attention 2 |
| RTX 3090 | 24GB | $0.13-0.20 | Large batches, longer sequences |

**Per Test:** $0.01-0.02 (with auto-cleanup)
**Monthly estimate** (100 tests): ~$1.50

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Instance takes long to load
**Cause:** 5-7 GB Docker image
**Solution:** Choose instances with fast networks (>500 Mbps download)

### Issue: SSH connection fails immediately
**Cause:** SSH not ready yet even though status is "running"
**Solution:** Wait 30 seconds after status changes to "running" (automated in `run_test_when_ready.sh`)

### Issue: SCP connection closed
**Cause:** Same as above - SSH not fully ready
**Solution:** Use the automated script which waits appropriately

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before running test, verify:
- [ ] Docker image built successfully (`gh run list --workflow=build-easyocr-image.yml --limit 1`)
- [ ] No instances currently running (`vastai show instances`)
- [ ] SSH key exists (`ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- [ ] Model exists locally (`ls models/doclingbert-v2-rebalanced/final_model/`)
- [ ] Test PDF exists (`ls data/v3_data/raw_pdf/antitrusts_interdependence_paradox.pdf`)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If test fails with "ModernBERT not recognized":
Docker image not updated. Force pull:
```bash
ssh -p <PORT> root@<HOST> "docker pull donaldbraman/body-extractor:latest"
```

### If instance never becomes "running":
Destroy and try different instance:
```bash
vastai destroy instance <ID>
```

### If results are empty:
Check that model uploaded correctly (Step 2/5 should show ~500MB transfer)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **ModernBERT is bleeding edge** - Not in stable transformers yet (needs 4.48.0+)
2. **Large Docker images are slow** - 5-7 GB takes 3-5 minutes to pull
3. **SSH readiness lags status** - Wait 30s after "running" before connecting
4. **Auto-cleanup is essential** - Prevents forgotten instances from accruing charges
5. **Network speed matters** - Choose instances with >500 Mbps for faster loading

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Run the test using the automated script
2. Review the 5 output files
3. Verify classification quality (check class_overlay.pdf)
4. If satisfied, integrate into your workflow

**Questions?** Check the troubleshooting section or re-run with verbose logging.

**Remember:** The script AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS the instance after completion to prevent charges!

*Delete these documentation files after successful testing.*
