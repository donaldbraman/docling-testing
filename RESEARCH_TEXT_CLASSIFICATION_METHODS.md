# Distinguishing Body Text from Footnotes in Legal Academic Documents: A Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of methods for automatically distinguishing between body text and footnotes in legal academic documents. Based on extensive research of current literature (2024-2025) and practical implementations, here are the key findings:

**Top Recommendations:**

1. **For Production Use (Best Balance)**: Fine-tuned **LegalBERT** or domain-adapted **DistilBERT** with feature engineering augmentation achieves optimal performance-efficiency trade-offs for this specific task.

2. **For Quick Prototyping**: Rule-based patterns combined with traditional ML (TF-IDF + SVM/Random Forest) can achieve strong baselines (>85% accuracy) with minimal training data.

3. **For Limited Training Data**: **SetFit** (few-shot learning with Sentence Transformers) can achieve state-of-the-art results with as few as 8-16 labeled examples per class.

4. **For Maximum Performance**: Ensemble hybrid approach combining:
   - Rule-based citation pattern detection (regex-based)
   - Fine-tuned transformer model (LegalBERT/RoBERTa)
   - Feature-engineered traditional ML (TF-IDF + SVM)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- HTML ground truth provides clean labels for supervised learning
- Feature engineering captures stylometric differences (punctuation, citation density, sentence length)
- Domain adaptation significantly improves transformer performance on legal text
- Active learning reduces annotation burden for PDF-extracted content

## Key Insights for Our Use Case

### 1. Relative Word Frequency Mining (PMI, Chi-Squared, Log-Likelihood)

Instead of guessing citation signals, **calculate** which words/n-grams are statistically overrepresented in footnotes:

**Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI):**
```
PMI(word, footnote) = log₂[P(word | footnote) / P(word | body)]
```

**Example:**
- P("supra" | footnote) = 0.15 (15% of footnotes contain "supra")
- P("supra" | body) = 0.001 (0.1% of body paragraphs)
- PMI = log₂(150) ≈ 7.2 ← Very strong footnote signal!

**What We'll Discover:**
- **Expected signals**: "supra", "infra", "Id.", "See", "Cf."
- **Unexpected patterns**: Specific verbs ("holding", "arguing"), punctuation density, n-grams ("See generally")
- **Body indicators**: "constitutional", "we argue", "Part II"

### 2. HTML Ground Truth Strategy

Law review HTML provides **semantic labels** for free:
- `<p>` tags = body text
- `<div class="footnote">` or `<sup><a href="#fn1">` = footnotes

**Scraping targets:**
- Harvard Law Review
- Stanford Law Review
- Yale Law Journal
- Columbia Law Review
- NYU Law Review

**Data collection yields:**
- 50-100 articles = 10,000+ labeled paragraphs
- No manual annotation required
- Training set for supervised ML

### 3. Distribution Shift Challenge

**Problem:** HTML structure ≠ PDF text extraction

**Solution:** Domain adaptation
1. Train on HTML labels (source domain)
2. Fine-tune on small PDF-labeled set (target domain)
3. Use active learning to select informative PDF examples

### 4. Recommended Staged Approach

**Week 1**: Baseline (TF-IDF + SVM) → 82-88% F1
**Week 2**: DistilBERT fine-tuning → 88-93% F1
**Week 3**: Domain adaptation (LegalBERT) → 90-95% F1
**Week 4**: Ensemble + deployment → 92-97% F1
