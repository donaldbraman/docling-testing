## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: JavaScript-Rendered Content
Stanford Law Review uses heavy JavaScript rendering to load article content, including:
- Full article text
- Footnotes
- PDF download links

**Impact:** Standard HTTP requests via `requests` library returned minimal HTML (~17KB) without full content.

**Solution:**
1. Used `curl` with browser user-agent to extract PDF URLs from the JavaScript-rendered pages
2. Manually extracted PDF URLs using regex pattern matching on the rendered HTML
3. Directly downloaded PDFs from Stanford's CDN (`review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/`)

**Note:** The instructions specified using "MCP Playwright" to bypass 403 errors and handle JavaScript rendering. However, no MCP Playwright server was available in the environment. The workaround using curl and regex extraction was successful for PDF downloads.

## Quality Validation

### HTML Files
- **Count:** 8 files

## Recommendations

### For Future Stanford Scraping

1. **Use Playwright/Selenium:** Stanford's site requires a full browser environment to properly render article content and footnotes. Consider using:
   - Playwright (as originally specified)
   - Selenium WebDriver
   - Puppeteer (Node.js)

2. **JavaScript Execution:** The scraper needs to:
   - Wait for dynamic content to load
   - Execute button clicks to expand footnotes
   - Extract PDF links from rendered DOM

3. **Alternative Approach:** If browser automation is unavailable:
   - Continue using the regex extraction method for PDF URLs
   - Consider the PDF as the primary source (it contains full content)
   - HTML files serve as metadata/structure reference

### For HTML Quality

The current HTML files lack full article text due to JS rendering. Options:
1. Re-scrape with Playwright to get complete HTML
2. Use PDFs as primary source (they contain complete content)
3. Accept current HTML as structural metadata only
