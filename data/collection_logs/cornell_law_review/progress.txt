CRITICAL BLOCKER
----------------

**Issue:** Cornell Law Review does NOT provide HTML full text for articles.

**Evidence:**
1. Main publication site (publications.lawschool.cornell.edu):
   - Only displays abstracts/summaries on web pages
   - Full text available ONLY via PDF download
   - Tested articles:
     * "Asian Americans and the Harm of Exceptionalized Inclusion"
       URL: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/2025/08/22/asian-americans-and-the-harm-of-exceptionalized-inclusion/
       PDF: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Matsumura-Suzuki-final.pdf

     * "Modern Cyber Warfare and International Law"
       URL: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/2025/08/20/modern-cyber-warfare-and-international-law/
       PDF: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/In-note-final.pdf

     * "(Non)Police Brutality"
       URL: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/2025/08/20/nonpolice-brutality/
       PDF: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Fields-final.pdf

2. Cornell Law Review Online section:
   - Same pattern: abstracts only
   - Tested: "The Federal Rules of Climate Change"
     URL: https://publications.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawreview/2025/07/23/the-federal-rules-of-climate-change/
     Result: Abstract only, PDF download required

3. Scholarship repository (scholarship.law.cornell.edu):
   - Metadata and PDF downloads only
   - Tested: "Against Prosecutors" (Vol 105, Issue 6)
     URL: https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol105/iss6/2
     Result: Metadata page with 3.3 MB PDF download link

CONCLUSION
----------

Cornell Law Review follows a traditional legal academic publication model:
- Web presence provides abstracts, metadata, and navigation
- Full article text is distributed exclusively via PDF files
- No HTML full-text versions available

This publication model makes it IMPOSSIBLE to collect HTML-PDF pairs for machine learning training. The journal can only provide PDF-only samples, not the paired HTML-PDF format required for the training corpus.

RECOMMENDATION
--------------

1. Mark Cornell Law Review as "PDF-only journal" in the collection strategy guide
2. Move to alternative law review that provides HTML full text
3. Consider journals using platforms like:
   - BePress Digital Commons (often has HTML)
   - Scholastica (sometimes has HTML)
   - Open Journal Systems (typically has HTML)

Suggested alternative journals to try:
- Harvard Law Review (has HTML versions)
- Yale Law Journal (has HTML versions)
- Stanford Law Review (has HTML versions)
- Berkeley Technology Law Journal (has HTML versions)
