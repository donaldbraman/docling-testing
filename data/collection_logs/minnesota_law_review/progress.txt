CONCLUSION
==========
Minnesota Law Review cannot provide HTML-PDF pairs for machine learning training
because the site architecture separates these formats:
- Academic articles: PDF-first publication model (HTML is just metadata)
- Blog posts: HTML-only content (no corresponding PDFs)

RECOMMENDATION
==============
Skip Minnesota Law Review and try alternative journals that publish
full HTML versions alongside PDFs. Consider:
- Stanford Law Review (known for HTML versions)
- Yale Law Journal (often has full HTML)
- Harvard Law Review (check for HTML availability)
- Columbia Law Review (check for HTML availability)

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (Not Recommended)
======================================
If PDFs are acceptable without HTML pairs:
- Minnesota Law Review has 100+ freely accessible PDFs
- Could collect PDFs only for corpus expansion
- Would require PDF-to-text conversion (Docling could handle this)
- Would not provide the HTML-PDF matching needed for current project goals

FILES DOWNLOADED
================
None - Collection not attempted due to format incompatibility

TOTAL COLLECTION
================
Target: 10-15 HTML-PDF pairs
Achieved: 0 pairs (site does not support this format)
Success Rate: 0% (due to site architecture, not scraping issues)

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Report blocker to user
2. Request alternative journal assignment
3. Consider updating collection strategy documentation with this finding
4. Add Minnesota Law Review to "PDF-only journals" list for future reference
