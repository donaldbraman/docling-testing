Bankruptcy painfully illustrates the social fact that the compensatory properties of tort law depend on the availability of compensatory resources. Although this feature of tort law is self-evident, no one has adequately analyzed whether it matters for substantive tort doctrine, and if so, how. Wealth would seem to be substantively irrelevant given the rule that excludes evidence concerning the defendant’s financial resources when determining breach or compensatory damages. The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor’s prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law—why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress. Accounting for the availability of compensatory resources reveals normative properties of substantive tort law that are often quite different from the ones modern tort theories depict, including the relation between tort law and criminal law and the vital role deterrence plays in a rights-based tort system. An adequate account of tort law must comprehend how the scarcity of compensatory resources alters substantive tort doctrine in principled ways." /><meta property="og:url" content="https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/" /><meta property="og:site_name" content="Michigan Law Review" /><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-10-06T15:31:11+00:00" /><meta property="og:image" content="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/media-card.jpg" /><meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" /><meta property="og:image:height" content="630" /><meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg" /><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" /><meta name="twitter:label1" content="Est. reading time" /><meta name="twitter:data1" content="156 minutes" /> <script type="application/ld+json" class="yoast-schema-graph">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@graph":[{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/","url":"https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/","name":"Tort Law in a World of Scarce Compensatory Resources - Michigan Law Review","isPartOf":{"@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#website"},"datePublished":"2025-10-02T07:00:00+00:00","dateModified":"2025-10-06T15:31:11+00:00","breadcrumb":{"@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/#breadcrumb"},"inLanguage":"en-US","potentialAction":[{"@type":"ReadAction","target":["https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/"]}]},{"@type":"BreadcrumbList","@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/tort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources/#breadcrumb","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https://michiganlawreview.org/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"In Print","item":"https://michiganlawreview.org/journal/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Tort Law in a World of Scarce Compensatory Resources"}]},{"@type":"WebSite","@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#website","url":"https://michiganlawreview.org/","name":"Michigan Law Review","description":"","publisher":{"@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#organization"},"potentialAction":[{"@type":"SearchAction","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://michiganlawreview.org/?s={search_term_string}"},"query-input":{"@type":"PropertyValueSpecification","valueRequired":true,"valueName":"search_term_string"}}],"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#organization","name":"Michigan Law Review","url":"https://michiganlawreview.org/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#/schema/logo/image/","url":"https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/media-card.jpg","contentUrl":"https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/media-card.jpg","width":1200,"height":630,"caption":"Michigan Law Review"},"image":{"@id":"https://michiganlawreview.org/#/schema/logo/image/"}}]}</script>  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.min.js?ver=3.7.1" id="jquery-core-js"></script> <link rel="https://api.w.org/" href="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-json/" /><link rel="alternate" title="JSON" type="application/json" href="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-json/wp/v2/repository_post/41269" /><link rel="EditURI" type="application/rsd+xml" title="RSD" href="https://michiganlawreview.org/xmlrpc.php?rsd" /><link rel='shortlink' href='https://michiganlawreview.org/?p=41269' /><link rel="alternate" title="oEmbed (JSON)" type="application/json+oembed" href="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-json/oembed/1.0/embed?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmichiganlawreview.org%2Fjournal%2Ftort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources%2F" /><link rel="alternate" title="oEmbed (XML)" type="text/xml+oembed" href="https://michiganlawreview.org/wp-json/oembed/1.0/embed?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmichiganlawreview.org%2Fjournal%2Ftort-law-in-a-world-of-scarce-compensatory-resources%2F&#038;format=xml" /></head><body class="wp-singular repository_post-template-default single single-repository_post postid-41269 wp-custom-logo wp-embed-responsive wp-theme-umls-journals wp-child-theme-mlr"> <noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-54WPQMS"

The scarcity of compensatory resources has always substantively mattered within the common law. The argument proceeds in five parts.</p><p>After identifying the relevant noncontroversial tort principles, Part I explains why courts can defensibly consider matters like insolvency and liability insurance when formulating substantive tort doctrine. To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a “social currency” that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injury-causing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.</p><p>Part III introduces the problem of scarce compensatory resources. Following the transition from the state of nature, the newly emergent state enforced legal obligations with ordinary money for paying taxes and the like.<a id="_Ref198216145"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="12" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-12">12</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-12" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="12"><em>See</em> <span class="small-caps">Robert Skidelsky, Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics</span> 23–27 (2018).<br /></span> By utilizing ordinary money as a form of social currency for enforcing legal obligations within the realm of injury compensation, the common law imbued the monetary damages remedy with a duality of normative meaning that persists to this day—it is both crassly commercial and a normative measure of fair compensation. Two different scarcity problems inhere within this medium for redressing injury.</p><p>First, money is a poor substitute for bodily injury—there is not enough money to compensate for a lost life, and money does not perfectly replace broken bones or fully correct for the fundamental alteration of one’s life. Recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented <em>ex ante</em> instead of being compensated <em>ex post </em>with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy. The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury. The normative importance of injury prevention, in turn, justifies both punitive damages and criminal punishment for culpable forms of injury-causing behavior. The compensatory limitations of tort liability accordingly shape the criminal law, contradicting the conventional account that treats tort law as the civilized outgrowth of the punitive practices that organize the criminal law.</p><p>As previously discussed, compensatory resources are also scarce because defendants often do not have enough money to satisfy their tort judgments. Under the early common law, a judgment that rendered the defendant insolvent was not simply a financial matter. The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="13" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-13">13</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-13" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="13"><em>See infra</em> notes 108–114 and accompanying text.<br /></span> Debtor’s prison—a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century<a id="_Ref197986738"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="14" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-14">14</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-14" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="14"><em>See</em> <span class="small-caps">Peter J.

Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant’s culpability. The subsequent emergence of modern bankruptcy law eliminated the burden of criminal punishment from this normative calculus. In principle, the transformation of debtor’s prison into modern bankruptcy could expand the scope of substantive tort liability, a dynamic that has never adequately factored into the leading accounts of tort law.</p><p>Part IV shows how these two problems of resource scarcity have influenced substantive tort doctrine. The relevant tort principles are not the products of any particular rationale for tort liability, such as allocative efficiency or corrective justice. They instead are embedded within the normative calculus that courts necessarily and openly apply when developing substantive tort law in a principled manner. Social facts involving the general availability of compensatory resources, including the spread of liability insurance, factor into this normative calculus in ways that predictably shape substantive tort law’s reach, causing it to either contract or expand.</p><p>These predictions are borne out in Part V, which confirms that the scarcity of compensatory resources can persuasively explain the basic structure of modern tort law—why it employs a default rule of negligence liability sometimes supplemented by rules of strict liability and limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress. Once one recognizes the principled ways in which the availability of compensatory resources affects substantive doctrine, the tort rules governing accidental injury have normative properties that modern tort theories have overlooked—a glaring gap if there ever was one.</p><h2><a id="_Toc203687833"></a>I.

To be protected by a right, an individual must have some interest that the law prevents others from interfering with merely because doing so would further their own interests or those of society. This formulation of the tort right is set forth at the outset of the multivolume <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts</em>: An individual interest that “is protected against any form of invasion . . . becomes the subject matter of a ‘right.’ ”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="17" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-17">17</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-17" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="17"><span class="small-caps"> Restatement (Second) of Torts</span> § 1 cmt. b (<span class="small-caps">A.L.I</span>. 1965).<br /></span></p><p>This property of a tort right has analytic implications for the normative structure of tort rules. For example, a tort right that protects the individual interest in physical security must give that interest some sort of legal priority over the duty-bearer’s potentially invading or conflicting liberty interest. When these two interests come into conflict, the right-holder’s prioritized interest in physical security prevails. Regardless of the underlying rationale for tort liability, any tort right necessarily prioritizes the right-holder’s legally protected interest over a specified conflicting, subordinate interest of the duty-bearer.</p><p>To prioritize among conflicting interests, a tort rule must first normatively distinguish them in a manner that justifies an interpersonal priority of one interest (such as security) over another (such as liberty). Although such a normative distinction ultimately derives from the underlying rationale for tort liability, once that distinction has been drawn, the resultant legal priority defines the substantive content of a tort right and its correlative duty.</p><p>An absolute right to physical security, for example, would entail a priority of that interest which prohibits risky actors from threatening it in any way. A pedestrian’s legally protected interest in physical security would have absolute priority over the conflicting liberty interests of automobile drivers using the same public roadway. An absolute priority would justify negating these potentially conflicting (absolutely subordinate) liberty interests with a legal rule that prohibits driving anytime the activity would threaten injury to a pedestrian—even if the risk of injury were minuscule. An absolute right to physical security would effectively shut down wide swaths of socially valuable activities, explaining why courts have long recognized, “[m]ost of the rights of property, as well as of person, . . . are not absolute but relative.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="18" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-18">18</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-18" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="18">Losee v.

In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. “Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.” <em>Id.</em> These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff’s protected, injured interest over the defendant’s conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner.

The resultant balancing, mediating, or weighing of these conflicting interpersonal interests defines the normative calculus of tort law.</p><p>The exact method or test for balancing conflicting interests turns on the fundamental rationale for tort liability. For example, courts could balance conflicting interpersonal interests in security and liberty by reference to an underlying principle of substantive equality that gives everyone an equal right to self-determination or autonomy. This type of balancing would require courts to determine the relative importance of the conflicting security and liberty interests for individuals to lead a life of their own choosing. Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare. Exactly how a tort rule balances one conflicting interest over another within the normative calculus of tort law depends on the highly contestable requirement of substantive equality and its implications for the nature of tort liability.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="25" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-25">25</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-25" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="25">Different theories of justice disagree about “which specific kind of equality is required by the more abstract idea of treating people as equals.” <span class="small-caps">Will Kymlicka</span>, <span class="small-caps">Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction 4 (</span>2d ed. 2001).

The financial capacity of an individual defendant is a case-specific fact which does not properly factor into a principled evaluation of a general tort duty governing a category of cases. To apply the normative calculus of tort law in the requisite categorical manner, courts must first consider the burden the duty would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer within the relevant category of cases. Courts must then compare that burden to the protection such a duty would afford the legally protected interest of the ordinary right-holder. Whereas the financial capability of an individual defendant is irrelevant to this inquiry, the compensatory resources available to the ordinary duty-bearer can affect the normatively relevant burden of the duty.</p><p>The burden a general tort duty imposes on the ordinary duty-bearer depends, in part, on the community’s compensatory resources. For the ordinary duty-bearer, any given tort duty will be more burdensome and more likely to be unreasonable in an impoverished community as compared to an affluent community, all else being equal. Hence, there is a principled reason for contracting or expanding the scope of a tort duty to account for the general availability of compensatory resources.</p><h2><a id="_Toc203687836"></a>II. The Common Law Under Conditions of Perfect Injury Compensation</h2><p>Thus far we have identified analytic reasons, inherent in the structure of tort rights and their correlative duties, showing why the availability of compensatory resources is substantively relevant as a matter of principle. This conclusion can be tested with a conceptual analysis, or thought experiment, asking what the common law would look like under conditions of perfect injury compensation. Compensation can be perfect only if there are no binding constraints on the resources for compensating injuries. In a world of unlimited compensatory resources, what would the common law look like? If the common law would be fundamentally altered, then the scarcity of compensatory resources presumably has substantive implications for the common law of torts.</p><p>This analytical approach is analogous to the one employed in the Coase Theorem, which analyzes tort rules under the unrealistic assumption that there are no transaction costs, thereby showing why and how transaction costs can be important for legal analysis.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="42" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-42">42</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-42" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="42"><em>See generally </em>R.H.

The development of individual rights had compensatory consequences—in the event of fatal injury, the decedent right-holder could never be compensated after the fact with monetary damages, an inherent compensatory problem that did not exist in the state of nature.</p><p>Whereas perfect compensation eliminates a legal concern about preventing injuries, the inability to adequately compensate premature death and other irreparable injuries made it necessary for the common law to prohibit certain kinds of injury-causing behaviors (like murder). These prohibitions—enforced with punitive measures—have always shaped both the common law of crimes and of torts. The use of punishment to correct for imperfect compensation traces further back into the state of nature, where the exchange of social currency could not attain equitable balance in cases of aggression.

The rise of punitive damages within tort law then became the injury victim’s surrogate to obtain retribution for reprehensible misconduct that the compensatory damages remedy could not adequately redress. But unlike its counterpart in the state of nature, the punitive remedy is embodied in an award of monetary damages. This tort remedy enables an injured victim to exact financial revenge without engaging in any violence—a civilized attribute of the tort remedy which gained further value as the market economy developed. The only way to punish a corporate wrongdoer—the cause of widespread injury in modern society—is by inflicting financial pain through a tort award of punitive damages. These developments have led to the now conventional understanding that the early common law “approach[ed] the field of tort through the field of crime.”<a id="_Ref197986270"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="87" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-87">87</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-87" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="87">2 <span class="small-caps">Frederick Pollock</span> <span class="small-caps">&amp;</span> <span class="small-caps">Frederic William Maitland, The History of English Law</span> 530 (2d ed. 1968); <em>see also </em><span class="small-caps">Dobbs, Hayden &amp; Bublick</span>, <em>supra </em>note 5, § 4, at 3 (“American common law, including tort law, grew out of English common law.

The Normative Duality of Monetary Damages</h3><p>Having historically situated the monetary damages remedy, we can now see why it is supposed to retain at least some of social currency’s normative properties. This duality is most apparent when monetary damages compensate the nonmonetary injuries of pain and suffering. Tort law recognizes that these damages “cannot restore the injured person to his previous position” and instead are supposed to “give to the injured person some pecuniary return for what he has suffered or is likely to suffer.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="89" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-89">89</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-89" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="89"><span class="small-caps"> Restatement (Second) of Torts</span> § 903 cmt. a (<span class="small-caps">A.L.I.</span> 1979).<br /></span> “[S]ome pecuniary return” for pain and suffering can be adequately compensatory only if the monetary damages serve as social currency that adequately restores plaintiffs to the same normative positions they occupied prior to their injuries.</p><p>For reasons nonmonetary injuries make clear, ordinary money is an ideal form of social currency within a welfarist conception of tort law.

There is considerable doubt whether this type of normative distinction can be fully drawn in a kinetic consumerist society. If the value of money is reflexively cashed out in terms of its consequences for consumer welfare, is there anything left for a nonwelfarist reordering of social relations? To the extent that money’s commodified meaning weakens its ability to function as social currency, this social fact will prevent the compensatory damages remedy from fully attaining its normative ideal in reordering social relationships.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="97" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-97">97</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-97" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="97"><em>Cf. </em><span class="small-caps">Zelizer</span>, <em>supra </em>note 49, at 200 (quoting<span class="small-caps"> Simmel</span>, <em>supra</em> note 49, at 444–45) (“To classical theorists the ‘mathematical character’ of money filled social life with ‘measuring and weighing,’ with an ‘ideal of numerical calculability,’ which necessarily blunted personal, social, and moral distinctiveness.”).<br /></span></p><p>But even if commercial money can still adequately serve as a form of social currency, its ability to function in that normative manner is considerably constrained by the irreparable nature of bodily injuries and the scarcity of money.

The Irreparable Injury of Wrongful Death</h3><p>The claim that tort damages are adequately compensatory is bankrupted by the common-law rule that barred recovery in the event of the right-holder’s death. The most severe bodily injury of all—premature death—received <em>zero </em>compensatory damages. There is no respect in which this damages rule restored right-holders to the normative position they occupied prior to the fatal injury, regardless of whether tort damages are supposed to be fair or full.</p><p>The manner in which tort law handles the problem of premature death has posed an ongoing puzzle. According to Frederick Pollock’s influential 1887 treatise:</p><blockquote><p>This is one of the least rational parts of our law. The common law maxim is <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona</em>, or the right of action for tort is put an end to by the death of either party . . . . At one time it may have been justified by the vindictive and <em>quasi</em>-criminal character of suits for civil injuries. A process which is still felt to be a substitute for private war [the blood feud] may seem incapable of being continued on behalf of or against a dead man’s estate . . . . But when once the notion of vengeance has been put aside, and that of compensation substituted, the rule <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona </em>seems to be without plausible ground.<a id="_Ref198404221"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="98" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-98">98</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-98" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="98"><span class="small-caps"> Frederick Pollock,</span> <span class="small-caps">The Law of Torts: A Treatise on the Principles of Obligations Arising from Civil Wrongs in the Common Law</span> 40–41 (Phila., The Blackstone Publ’g Co. 1887) (paragraph structure omitted).<br /></span></p></blockquote><p>This compensatory problem motivated state legislatures to enact wrongful-death statutes that enable statutorily specified plaintiffs (either certain family members or the decedent’s estate) to recover for their own injuries caused by the defendant’s violation of the decedent’s tort right.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="99" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-99">99</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-99" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="99"><em>E.g.</em>, Thompson v.

We return, then, to Pollock’s claim that there is no “plausible ground” for this feature of the common law.</p><p>Pollock assumes that the damages remedy supplies the only protection against wrongful death, and so the common-law rule barring recovery implies that tort law does not protect individuals from fatal injuries. However, if tort law otherwise adequately accounts for these harms outside the damages remedy, then it could fairly protect individuals from the threat of premature death even in the absence of both criminal and tort liability. Put somewhat differently, although wrongful-death damages are neither fair nor full for the decedent right-holder, the tort right might nevertheless be constructed to fairly protect right-holders from bodily injury, including premature death. In that event, imperfect injury compensation via the damages remedy for wrongful death would influence the negligence rule’s substantive formulation. We discuss these issues at greater length in Part IV.</p><h3><a id="_Toc203687843"></a>D. The Problem of Insolvency</h3><p>The discussion so far has shown that compensatory resources are scarce in part because no amount of money can fully repair a lost life or a badly injured body. The other primary reason for the scarcity of compensatory resources stems from the social fact that defendants often do not have enough financial assets to satisfy a tort judgment—the problem of insolvency.</p><p>In light of debt’s historical importance and the associated obligations that normatively ordered social relations in ancient societies, it should come as no surprise that one’s failure to pay off a compensatory debt—or any other debt for that matter—was an egregious wrongdoing. Hence, many of the “common words for ‘debt’ in European languages” are “synonyms for ‘fault,’ ‘sin,’ or ‘guilt’; just as a criminal owes a debt to society, a debtor is always a sort of criminal.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="104" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-104">104</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-104" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="104"><span class="small-caps"> Graeber</span>, <em>supra </em>note 46, at 121.<br /></span></p><p>An insolvent injurer accordingly incurred severe penalties for failing to compensate.

The Relevance of Scarce Compensatory Resources for Substantive Tort Law</h2><p>Compensatory resources are scarce for two basic reasons: Ordinary money is a poor substitute for the irreparable harm of bodily injury, and defendants often do not have enough money to fully satisfy their compensatory obligations. Both sources of scarcity factor into the normative calculus of tort law and change the substantive common law from its idealized compensatory form into a set of rules that largely characterize the modern tort system and its relation to the criminal law. Having identified the reasons why substantive tort law depends on the availability of compensatory resources, we can now fill in the heretofore missing account of how bankruptcy and liability insurance shape substantive tort doctrine as a matter of principle.</p><h3>A. <a id="_Toc203687845"></a>Compensatory Scarcity and the Normative Calculus of Tort Law</h3><p>A perfectly compensatory social currency can always attain the requisite equitable balance in cases of bodily injury, eliminating the legal concern about preventing injury. The social currency perfectly substitutes for the victim’s lost bodily integrity in the relevant normative sense, thereby erasing any inherent normative difference between the victim’s physical-security interest and the injurer’s conflicting liberty interest. Premature death and other irreparable bodily injuries, however, preclude such compensation and accordingly alter the normative balance between security and liberty.</p><p>Without more, an entitlement to an inherently inadequate compensatory damage award does not adequately protect the individual interest in physical security. More protection is vitally important. Unless they are adequately secure from the threat of bodily injuries and premature death, individuals are severely constrained in their ability to live freely in the world. The meaningful exercise of liberty depends on a baseline of adequate physical security.<a id="_Ref197986636"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="116" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-116">116</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-116" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="116"><em>See, e.g.</em>,<span class="small-caps"> Dworkin</span>, <em>supra </em>note 24, at 148–49 (“[A]ny competent baseline liberty/constraint system would include a principle of security: this would mandate constraints on liberty necessary to provide people with enough physical security and enough control over their own property to allow them to make and carry out plans and projects.”); <span class="small-caps">Gregory C.

Deterrence is an essential property for understanding tort law that is overlooked by formulations of corrective justice which assume that compensatory damages can always normatively correct for wrongdoing and fully restore normative equilibrium.</p><p>The substantive implications of this deterrence reasoning extend beyond the requirements of reasonable care. The foregoing discussion does not rule out the possibility that, in some cases, duty-bearers can reduce their costs by acting negligently and paying (inherently inadequate) compensatory damages instead of complying with a demanding behavioral obligation to exercise reasonable care. To address this problem, the common law relies on punitive remedies.</p><h3><a id="_Toc203687847"></a>C. Punitive Damages and Criminal Liability</h3><p>To prevent the irreparable injuries of premature death and other physical harms, tort law uses negligence liability as the baseline rule governing accidental injury. This liability rule obligates duty-bearers to act reasonably, thereby prohibiting them from choosing to engage in unreasonably dangerous behaviors in exchange for the payment of (inherently inadequate) damages as compensation for any ensuing (irreparable) harms. A defendant who consciously disregards or intentionally violates the plaintiff’s tort right is subject to punishment under both tort law and criminal law.</p><p>First consider punitive damages, which, according to the courts, “are aimed at deterrence and retribution.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="150" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-150">150</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-150" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="150">State Farm Mut.

However, when a defendant reprehensibly breaches the duty, the payment of compensatory damages does not adequately correct for the injustice of wrongfully causing irreparable harm.

To do so, tort law must prioritize the right-holder’s interest in physical security (the protected object) over the duty-bearer’s compensatory obligation and the associated burden on liberty. By justifying a relative interpersonal priority of the individual interest in physical security, the problem of scarce compensatory resources also creates two distinctive rationales for strict liability.</p><h4>1. <a id="_Toc203687849"></a>Deterrence and the Evidentiary Rationale for Strict Liability</h4><p>The difficulty of proving negligent misconduct predictably creates a deterrence problem.

Right-Holders’ Resources as a Limit of Compensatory Liability</h4><p>A compensatory norm seems to justify a general rule of strict liability for all accidental harms as a complement to the behaviorally demanding negligence standard of reasonable care. The threat of punitive damages for culpable forms of unreasonably dangerous behaviors would enforce the baseline duty to exercise reasonable care, while the strict liability rule provides compensation for the residual harms. Why, then, does modern tort law only employ strict liability in highly circumscribed circumstances?</p><p>Once again, an adequate analysis of the tort problem implicates the scarcity of compensatory resources—in this instance, involving the compensatory resources of right-holders rather than duty-bearers. As a matter of principle, judges are supposed “to enforce . . . rights up to the point at which enforcement ceases to be in the interests of those the rights are supposed to protect.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="171" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-171">171</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-171" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="171"><span class="small-caps"> Dworkin</span>, <em>supra </em>note 32, at 392 (discussing constitutional rights); <em>see also id.</em> at 390 (“[T]he point of constitutional adjudication is not merely to name rights but to secure them, and to do so in the interests of those whose rights they are.”).<br /></span> Tort law cannot justifiably enforce a compensatory right when doing so would ultimately work to the net detriment of the right-holders who are supposed to be compensated.</p><p>This constraint on the fair or just enforcement of individual rights is often irrelevant. For many risky interactions, right-holders would benefit from more extensive enforcement, and so any liability limitations stem from a concern about imposing excessive liability on duty-bearers. Right-holders are concerned about excessive liability, however, when they effectively pay for the burdens that duty-bearers incur to comply with the tort obligation. In such cases, tort law can justifiably limit liability to protect right-holders.</p><p>For example, a tort obligation to install airbags in a reasonably designed automobile will prompt the manufacturer to increase the vehicle’s price to cover that cost. Likewise, the vehicle’s price will cover the manufacturer’s other liability costs, including those of injury compensation. The equilibrium contract price in a market based on the normatively justified set of entitlements accordingly embodies the full cost of the tort obligation. Because consumer right-holders fully pay for the correlative tort obligations of manufacturer duty-bearers, liability can be excessive by unreasonably burdening the legally protected interests of these right-holders via increased prices.</p><p>To make a contractual undertaking worthwhile, a seller must cover all costs of performing the contract, including those obligations incurred by virtue of tort law. Right-holders who bear the costs of a correlative duty essentially pay for their entitlement to compensatory damages, altering the normative calculus of tort law.</p><p>In what respect is it equitable or fair to require someone else to compensate your injury when you are the one paying for that compensation? Paying for an entitlement to injury compensation is exactly the same thing an individual does when purchasing insurance. A purely compensatory tort obligation running from duty-bearers to the right-holders who ultimately incur those costs collapses into an insurance transaction.</p><p>For the ordinary right-holder of this type, a purely compensatory tort entitlement significantly increases their total costs without providing a sufficient offsetting benefit because the tort damages function as a form of duplicative, unnecessary insurance for them. For example, the ordinary consumer has health insurance covering medical expenses.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="172" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-172">172</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-172" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="172">In 2020, 92% of the U.S. population had health insurance. <em>See </em><span class="small-caps">U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey: Selected Economic Characteristics</span> (2023), <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=DP03">https://data.census.gov/table?q=DP03</a> [<a href="https://perma.cc/4569-WYXD">perma.cc/4569-WYXD</a>].<br /></span> Consumers purchase these policies regardless of their entitlement to tort compensation for product-caused injuries. Their ability to recover compensatory damages for the medical expenses of treating these injuries does not obviate their need to purchase broader insurance covering medical expenses unrelated to product-caused injuries, like those for treating diseases, illnesses, and so on. Rather than providing these right-holders with a valuable source of injury compensation, an entitlement to tort compensation routinely provides them with duplicative insurance.

Strict products liability, in other words, is justified by deterrence reasoning and not by the fairness of compensation.</p><p>For these same reasons, a purely compensatory rule of strict liability can also be excessively costly for right-holders outside contractual settings. A wide range of risky behaviors contribute to the background level of reasonable risk in a community. For example, reasonably safe driving can still cause a crash. This familiar form of risky behavior is part of the background level of reasonable risk a community tolerates. The duty governing these kinds of common, risky social interactions burdens the ordinary person while creating risks (such as by driving); it also protects them from the risky behavior of others (like passing drivers on the roadway). For the category of risky interactions comprising the background level of reasonable risk in the community, the ordinary right-holder is also a reciprocally situated duty-bearer who incurs the full burden of the duty. This distributive outcome—like in contractual settings—eliminates a compensatory rationale for strict liability.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="176" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-176">176</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-176" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="176">For more rigorous demonstration, see Geistfeld, <em>supra </em>note 79, at 1564–82.<br /></span></p><p>By implication, a purely compensatory rule of strict liability can be fair for right-holders only for risky interactions outside contractual settings that create nonreciprocal or abnormal dangers above the background level of reasonable risk in the community.

The injurious interactions in the state of nature were limited to cases in which the member of one family, clan, or tribe harmed someone from another. These social interactions were neither contractual nor reciprocally situated within a community’s background level of reasonable risk—there was not one political community in the state of nature but many independent clans and the like.

A purely compensatory tort rule, by definition, is wholly justified in terms of fair or reasonable injury compensation and not by injury deterrence (unlike negligence and related rules of strict liability formulated to overcome the evidentiary hurdles of proving negligence liability). A purely compensatory tort rule is allocatively inefficient: The compensatory transfer merely shifts the injury costs from one party to the other while creating the associated transaction costs. In the absence of deterrence, social costs are minimized by letting the loss fall on the injured accident victim. How, then, can a compensatory rule of strict liability be squared with the normative calculus of tort law defined in terms of both welfarist and nonwelfarist rationales for tort liability?</p><p>Though allocatively inefficient, a tort obligation to compensate these kinds of injuries does not violate a welfarist rationale for tort liability. These compensatory transfers find justification in Pareto optimality, a normative cornerstone of welfare economics that formulates liability rules so that the risky behavior makes no one worse off.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="185" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-185">185</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-185" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="185">In the same way that deterrence can justifiably shape tort law even if tort liability does not optimally deter, the ideal of full compensation embodied in the Pareto principle can justifiably shape tort law under second-best conditions of imperfect injury compensation. <em>See generally </em>Mark A.

For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, <em>The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations</em>, 15 <span class="small-caps">Theoretical Inquiries L.</span> 387, 394–96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder’s willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.<br /></span> A compensatory rule, such as strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities, accordingly satisfies the basic requirements of both fairness and welfarist rationales within the normative calculus of tort law, albeit in a more normatively complex manner than conventional economic theories depict by exclusively focusing on cost minimization and allocative efficiency.</p><p>In yet one more respect, then, the problem of scarce compensatory resources alters the normative calculus of tort law in a predictable way that conventional tort theories have not recognized. Like duty-bearers, right-holders do not have unlimited compensatory resources and accordingly have a reasonable interest in minimizing their injury compensation costs. For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder’s total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrence-based liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.</p><h3><a id="_Toc203687853"></a>E.

An accident victim’s interest in economic security or emotional tranquility, though important and worthy of legal protection in the appropriate cases, could not justify sending someone to prison for their inability to pay off these tort debts. Such a severe deprivation of a negligent injurer’s liberty is normatively more burdensome than the accident victim’s financial loss or emotional distress. The problem of insolvency and the looming threat of debtor’s prison explain why courts of this era barred claims for pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional distress on the ground that duty-bearers would otherwise “face liabilities that are indeterminate and out of proportion to their culpability.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="230" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-230">230</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-230" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="230"><span class="small-caps"> Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Econ.

Rather than focus on how liability these days might be excessive for duty-bearers—a questionable concern since the injuries in question are a proximate cause of a defendant’s negligence—the inquiry can instead look at the extent of liability from the perspective of right-holders. The total amount of the ordinary duty-bearer’s compensatory resources will often not be sufficient to cover the claims of each physically harmed victim and the ten or more others who, as a foreseeable consequence, are emotionally distressed or have incurred pure economic loss.

Of course, some bodily injuries quickly heal, whereas some emotional harms and financial losses are debilitating. But as a categorical matter—the appropriate analytical frame for duty purposes—bodily injuries are worse than these other harms. Physical harm also encompasses damage to real or tangible property, which raises issues that require a more extended explanation of why these kinds of losses are worse than the others, particularly those involving intangible forms of property (like money). A key difference is that the monetary damages can fully repair pure economic losses (a dollar is a dollar). By contrast, real or tangible personal property (like one’s house and the personal items it contains) is not ordinarily a fully fungible commodity with other items in the marketplace and cannot be fully repaired with compensatory damages.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="241" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-241">241</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-241" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="241"><em>See generally</em> Janice Nadler, <em>The Social Psychology of Property: Looking Beyond Market Exchange</em>, 14 <span class="small-caps">Ann.

We considered a situation where “a defendant negligently causes an automobile accident that blocks a major traffic artery such as a bridge or tunnel.” That defendant would of course be liable for “personal injuries and property damage suffered in such an accident.” But would “any court,” we continued, “allow recovery by the myriad [other] third parties who might claim [purely] economic losses because the bridge or tunnel” was blocked?

The tort duty encompassed physical harms, just like it did in the hypothetical automobile accident the court discussed in which the “defendant would of course be liable for ‘personal injuries and property damage.’ ” If the duty in these cases were expanded to encompass both the physically harmed victim(s) and those who might suffer foreseeable economic losses, there would be a massive increase in the number of tort claimants, as the California Supreme Court recognized. That liability would be excessive insofar as insolvency would be a predictable consequence, leading to the question of why insolvency provides a principled reason to limit the substantive tort duty.</p><p>An exclusive focus on the defendant’s interests only implicates the defendant’s unreasonable exercise of liberty. The defendant negligently caused all these foreseeable harms, and insolvency would not lead to debtor’s prison. An unreasonable liberty interest is not plausibly prioritized over the conflicting interests of foreseeable accident victims, whether those interests involve physical security or economic harms. Like the now outdated concern about culpability, the defendant’s interests do not provide a principled justification for substantively limiting the tort duty to fend off bankruptcy.</p><p>The principled concern about bankruptcy instead derives from the security interests of right-holders, which have priority over the conflicting economic interests of the other accident victims. This priority—“the worst should go first”—provides a normatively defensible reason to limit the duty to those with physical harms.

For example, courts permit recovery for pure economic losses if there is “some special relation between the parties” such as “a telegraph company’s negligent transmission of a message,” the “negligent failure to perform a gratuitous promise to obtain insurance, and the negligent delay in acting upon an application for insurance.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="257" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-257">257</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-257" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="257">Union Oil Co. v.

Like the ordinary duty governing physical harms, the substantive duty encompassing the financial costs of medical monitoring is grounded in the equitable concern to prevent these irreparable bodily injuries from happening.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="258" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-258">258</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e7f0000000000000000_41269-258" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="258"><em>See generally</em> Geistfeld, <em>supra</em> note 221 (arguing that the equitable maxim of the “worst goes first” does not defensibly limit the medical-monitoring cause of action).<br /></span></p><p>Like the tort rules recognizing claims for stand-alone emotional harms in exceptional cases, courts permit similar recoveries for pure economic loss when they do not unduly exhaust the ordinary duty-bearer’s financial resources for compensating physically harmed victims.

The contraction will not be that severe—fortunately, there is no debtor’s prison this time around.
