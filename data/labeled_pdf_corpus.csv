The normative character of rules correspond, above all, to the need to remove the state of chaos, disorder, unpredictability. The ordering of the rules of societal coexistence, regardless of the epoch and geography, has been considered necessary and beneficial for the group. Such a need, to organize a desired model of order, could be met by both legal as well as cultural rules.

Among other ways, culture could be understood as a distinction from nature. Culture appears at the moment of any human intervention into anything that a human meets or creates that has not been transformed by human intervention earlier. Etymologically, it refers to cultivation. In fact, it is a primary meaning when humans began to order and at the same time subjugate nature, to interfere with it.

Similarly, language as a means of this transmission plays an important role in law and in culture. It is an integral part of culture and sometimes equally culture is a part of what language describes. To the same extent language gives a substance to words and forms a way of articulating legal rules while at the same time law must be expressed in a language.

Tylor, culture is composed of elements such as knowledge, arts, ethics, laws, customs, and other societal skills and habits created throughout history. 8 Describing it more generally and analytically, Bierstedt assesses that culture is composed of everything that humans do, think, and own. 9 Consequently, three types of cultures can be differentiated: (i) normative culture, (ii) ideal (symbolic) culture and (iii) material culture. This division, which is useful in anthropological and sociological analysis, may be relatively less useful while studying the interrelation of cultural and legal rules. For the purpose of this article, we assume that the culture sensu largo embraces also law, science, art, religion, namely all products of mindful and directional activities of humans, built across the times, across geographies and civilizations.

The Court asserted that equal protection requires that a student's race may never be used as a 'negative,' policies may not 'stereotype' students based on race, and policies must have a fixed endpoint. Yet, if we accept as given the Court's definitions of 'stereotype' and 'negative,' the Court's exception for race-based essays violates all three requirements.",body_text,text,0.9168241965973536,4.0,28.0

'[B]y grouping together all Asian students, for instance, respondents are apparently uninterested in whether South Asian or East Asian students are adequately represented, so long as there is enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other.' 67 Roberts offered no support for his intuition that South Asian and East Asian do not belong in the same category. He also provided no citation for the claim that universities do not care if one of those subgroups is underrepresented. There is a squishy quality to Roberts's critiques of racial categories.

Earlier in his opinion, Roberts asserted that race-conscious admissions policies are zero-sum. 115 That is, conferring a 'benefit' on an URM requires bestowing a 'negative' on a White or Asian American applicant (even though scholarship casts doubt on the statistical significance of that 'negative'). 116 Technically, any student may write about experiencing racial discrimination or how their racial background has inspired them. In that sense, the essay exception is facially neutral. It does not contain a racial classification. Perhaps that is what Roberts meant by denying that admitting students based on their essays is admitting them 'on the basis of race.' 117 But the same was said of the admissions policies approved in Grutter and Bakke : White students too could display their 'diversity.' As a practical matter, moreover, we know that White people are less likely to regard their race as a significant part of their identities and less likely to report racial discrimination. 118 Black people, surveys suggest, are the most likely to report that they have been subjected to racial discrimination and Latine and Asian American reports of racial discrimination tend to fall in between those of Black people and White people.

As a formal matter, it would treat each student equally. As a practical matter, however, it would impose burdens predominantly on race-conscious students of color. Most White applicants could write about their full range of life experiences and would not have to self-censor. By contrast, many students of color would have to edit out their racialized experiences and also figure out whether certain stories would even make sense after excising racial dimensions. Moreover, as Carbado and Harris argued, students of color who remove racial references from their essays risk being read as White because 'white identity is normative, or put another way, whiteness 'goes without saying.'' 158 Neither an essay that explicitly invokes one's experience as a person of color nor an essay that omits that experience is 'colorblind.' 159 Carbado and Harris's insightful examination of the racial politics of essay writing and reading strongly suggests that genuine colorblindness and race-neutrality is simply not possible in this context.",body_text,text,0.990376202974628,55.0,253.0

Could it be that some Justices understood the inequality of banning racial narratives, even though such a ban would not take the shape of a racial classification? Perhaps at some level, Roberts and those who joined his opinion could not deny that race matters in students' experiences, and forbidding students from expressing that would be discrimination. If so, that would be a notable expansion of equal protection doctrine in two respects. First, for all of Roberts's efforts to deny that race matters, it would suggest that at some level he acquiesced to the dissenters. The main theme of the dissenting opinions was surely race matters . 168 Perhaps there was some implicit common ground between the majority and the dissenters. Second, it would constitute a rare judicial acknowledgement of racial harm experienced by people of color in the absence of a racial classification. 169 This is less meaningful as precedent of course because the Court provided no rationale for the essay exception. 170 Nonetheless, the essay exception, in combination with the majority's suggestion of a military exception, 171 and validation of raceconsciousness in a contemporaneous voting rights case 172 refute the notion that the Equal Protection Clause imposes 'colorblindness for all.' 173 Given that the Court failed to provide any principles for exempting essays and the military from a presumption of 'colorblindness,' it will initially fall to lower courts to draw lines between contexts when race-consciousness is and is not permissible.",body_text,text,0.989667049368542,58.0,269.0

SFFA's first claim pitted Asian Americans against White applicants, while the second claim asserted that the two groups shared a disadvantage vis-à-vis Black, Latine, and Indigenous applicants. Roberts's divergent treatment of SFFA's distinctive claims of racial discrimination further undercut his valorization of 'colorblindness.' As explained by the First Circuit, SFFA's lawsuit challenged two different aspects of Harvard's admissions policy: (1) Harvard's reliance on a 'personal rating' stereotyped the personalities of Asian American applicants and thus reduced their odds of admission; 174 and (2) Harvard's granting of a 'plus' to URM students for diversity illegally conferred a 'negative' on Asian American and White applicants. 175 The Supreme Court majority endorsed the rhetoric of anti-Asian bias during oral argument and in opinions by conservative Justices. But the majority ultimately failed to rule on SFFA's challenge to the personal rating and even declined to explain this move. The Court granted Asian American applicants relief only insofar as their interests aligned with White applicants. The Court simply ignored SFFA's argument that White applicants received an unfair advantage because they were said to be more personable.

california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution,"This Essay has sought to make visible how colorblindness rhetoric may mask race-conscious realities. The Court's ruling in SFFA does not install colorblindness across the board. 207 To the contrary, it creates a veneer of colorblindness that masks the approval of race conscious admissions. It encourages students to write race-conscious essays and permits universities to admit students based on their lived experiences with race. This means that Grutter 's authorization of race-conscious individualized consideration lives on in the context of essays. 208 As Jonathan Feingold has suggested, 'colorblindness' should be understood as a heuristic that conceals multiple assumptions about whether race does and should matter in law and society. 209 Accordingly, I urge judges and scholars to unpack and deconstruct assertions of colorblindness. Close scrutiny reveals that claims about 'colorblindness,' 'preferences,' 'race neutrality,' and 'merit' often turn on a fictional baseline in which race does not matter. 210 Race has always mattered in America, and the 2024 election suggests that it will continue to do so at least for our lifetimes.

california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation,"We describe four alternative approaches to resolving interdepartmental disputes. 4 First, some members of the founding generation embraced an Antidomination theory about legislative and executive powers. 5 This theory denied that the terms 'executive' or 'legislative' implied justiciable limits on government authority, at least beyond certain specifically enumerated powers. It instead stipulated processes by which the legislative and executive branches could enact legally binding policies: Legislation must be enacted through bicameralism and presentment, and the President must act via express statutory or constitutional authorization. The constitutionally relevant fact was that each branch respected the Constitution's procedural constraints. To be sure, other structural theories travelled alongside this view, but for some early interpreters of the Constitution, the drafters' political theory focused on the document's procedural checks as the 'practical' elaboration of the core idea, not on metaphysical appeals to the concept of 'executive,' 'legislative,' or 'judicial.' 6",body_text,text,0.9554841670491052,4.0,14.0

Courts used the distinction between public rights and public enterprises, on the one hand, and private rights and private enterprises, on the other, to ground the constitutionality of agency deference, adjudication, and rulemaking. Many of today's separationof-powers concerns were therefore subsumed under the question of the publicity of the actor subject to regulatory oversight. This reasoning is typically associated with the Lochner era and, to our knowledge, has not been understood as a theory of interbranch relations. 7 Yet, in providing the decisive test to determine when government could control private conduct, the Public Utility idea also came to settle interbranch disputes about legislatures', agencies', and courts' roles in regulating economic activity.",body_text,text,0.9532814238042268,5.0,15.0

In this view, the meaning of the Constitution changed based on evolving practical considerations. For example, within a four-decade period in the nineteenth century, concern about the effectiveness of the civil service was used to justify both presidential removal of civil servants and Congress's role in regulating removal. Initially, corruption in the civil service justified heightened removal powers and a rotation-in-office system. 11 Then, a decade later, concern about the government's inability to retain expert administrators caused the tide to shift toward more robust removal protections. 12 These were thought not to reflect incompatible theories of the executive power, but rather an understanding that constitutional principles should evolve with changing economic and political circumstances. 13 Cases from this fourth category have been marshaled to support different theories of departmental limits, many of which have continued relevance in modern formalist and functionalist debates.

It therefore violates a formalist separation of powers, since it involves the exercise of legislative power by a non-legislative actor. 36 The same mode of reasoning applies to the President's authority to remove administrative officials. Article II vests executive powers in the President. 37 According to formalists, that grant conveys exclusive authority to supervise executive departments and thus carries with it the power to appoint and remove personnel. 38 While the appointment power is formally shared with Congress, the Constitution's silence about removal suggests that the residual power must be the President's alone.

So long as Congress (1) follows the procedures enumerated in the Constitution, and (2) respects specific allocative grants in the Constitution's text, no other formal constraint is breached. Conversely, agency rulemaking is not a 'quasi-legislative' act.

For some, public rights involve claims against the government. For others, they refer to 'civil actions by the government to enforce obligations created by statute.' 312",body_text,text,0.9907502569373072,164.0,550.0

Sometimes, it was about the business's market power or importance to the local economy. 315 Thus, a publicprivate distinction was used to resolve constitutional challenges to agency adjudications in circumstances that look quite different from the public-private distinction that was ostensibly embraced in Murray's Lessee , and it did so throughout the thirty years when the United States was assembling a modern bureaucracy.",body_text,text,0.9919137466307276,166.0,556.0

This publicprivate distinction thus resolved interbranch disputes, but not through a modern taxonomy of Article I or Article II powers.

Ames, 169 U.S. 466, 526 (1898) ('While rates for the transportation of persons and property within the limits of a state are primarily for its determination, the question whether they are so unreasonably low as to deprive the carrier of its property without such compensation as the constitution secures, and therefore without due process of law, cannot be so conclusively determined by the legislature of the state, or by regulations adopted under its authority, that the matter may not become the subject of judicial inquiry.'). Sometimes, publicness existed because the regulated entity was given a privilege, as occurred when it was given power to exercise eminent domain or a certificate of public convenience and necessity. But the grant of a government privilege was not dispositive.

For example, the constitutionality of deference emerged as a way of mediating firms' residual private property rights. 318 Today however, the public-private distinction has little to say about the constitutionality of agency deference. Instead, the relevant constitutional question is whether excessive deference prevents courts or legislatures from exercising their constitutionally assigned powers. To answer these structural questions, courts draw on twentiethcentury deference cases that were decided on the basis of a public-private distinction. Thus, while the jurisprudence of this era-the advent of hard-look review, the supposed omnipresence of the nondelegation doctrine before the New Deal-is routinely offered today as evidence of a formalist or functionalist past, 319 the usefulness of those precedents is based on holdings that rested on constitutional theories that were explicitly and emphatically discarded in the 1930s. 320",body_text,text,0.8346738159070599,169.0,564.0

The relevant question is whether the federal actor has respected the Constitution's procedural checks. The public utility approach discerns structural limits by asking whether a policy or business is affected with the public interest.

Each judge and their clerks work in a small, intimate chambers environment. 119 Each chambers is 'a fiefdom, with its own rules and norms.' 120 The relationship between a judge and a clerk is consequently more 'similar to that of a professor and a student than a traditional employment relationship.' 121 Judges are not only clerks' bosses, but also recommenders who help propel clerks to the next phase of their career paths. 122 Filing a complaint could result in a negative recommendation that could impact a clerk's professional trajectory.

california_law_review_loving-borders,"This Essay explores the implications of the Muñoz decision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The Court took an unnecessarily maximalist approach in Muñoz, undermining the practical value of the right to marriage for individuals married to noncitizens. Part II argues that the Court did so through one of its frequently used moves: namely, denying rights protections to a U.S. resident (here, a citizen by birth and resident of California) through a sleight of hand that r educed Muñoz's constitutional rights and interests to those of a constitutional 'outsider.' 9 This aspect of the case foreshadows the continued erosion of constitutional protections for the members of historically subordinated groups. Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades of constitutional case law by denying courts a role in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court's substantive due process analysis in Muñoz. 10 Invidious discrimination drove, and was manifested in, the Court's reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent. Part V critiques the historical errors of the Court's purportedly originalist account and its selected level of generality. The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications of Muñoz for the Constitution's promise of equal protection. Muñoz 's limited reading of the 'right to marriage' obviously shrinks the protective scope of the Constitution's due process protections.

Hite , illustrates this concept. 46 In Simpson , the relevant state law required county boards of supervisors to provide 'suitable quarters' for local courts. 47 Although the State set that overarching policy, the law gave boards of supervisors discretion to determine 'what is required to constitute 'suitable quarters.'' 48 In Los Angeles, the Board of Supervisors set a location for a courthouse, the planning commission affirmed it, and the county solicited bids. 49 At that point, disgruntled citizens started circulating an initiative petition to force the County to choose a different site for the courthouse. 50 The California Supreme Court removed the initiative from the ballot and held that the Board of Supervisors was acting as an administrative agent of the state. 51 The State had 'acted to establish the basic policy' of creating suitable quarters for courthouses across the state and had 'vested the responsibility for carrying out that policy' with the county boards of supervisors. 52 Thus, despite holding legislative power, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors was performing an administrative function 'specifically imposed by the state.' 53 The court deemed this function beyond the scope of the people's initiative power. 54",body_text,text,0.955621301775148,12.0,72.0

Hite was couched in the administrative-legislative test, its justification for holding that the courthouse location could not be subject to the local initiative power was all about procedural inconsistencies. 125 Justice Arabian's dissent in DeVita is consistent with this understanding of the preemption power. 126",body_text,text,0.9846547314578004,29.0,182.0

The statewide RHNA process is plainly incompatible with the exercise of local direct democracy powers. From the outset, the entire RHNA process takes two years to complete: HCD tells the COGs how much housing they need to plan for two years before the housing elements are due, and the COGs are required to tell local governments their respective allocations no later than a year before the housing elements are due. 139 This allows at most a year for an initiative to pass and even less for a referendum to reject a proposed housing element. The initiative process takes significant time: an unspecified amount of time to prepare the petition, 15 days after submission to receive a title and summary from the city attorney, 140 no more than 180 days to collect signatures, 141 and an additional 30 days (excluding weekends and holidays) for the local elections official to certify that the petition had sufficient signatures. 142 In sum, that is 225 days just to get a viable petition. From there, the city council has 10 days to adopt the petition, order a report (which could add 30 more days), or submit the petition to a vote. 143 That is a maximum of 265 days after the petition was submitted before voters even get a look at the initiative. 144 It is hard to reconcile the time required to submit a petition to vote with the year-long deadline the State has imposed upon local governments to adopt a housing element. 145",body_text,text,0.9923562645397142,35.0,208.0

Hite by saying that, in Simpson , the only discretion in the hands of a local government was 'the choice of a site' for a courthouse. 159 In contrast, local governments under the Coastal Act had discretion over what to build, so long as their decisions complied with the State's 'specific policies' outlined in the Coastal Act. 160 In the present case, the adoption of a housing element requires cities to plan for a specific amount of housing, 161 unlike the Coastal Act's broad land use oversight. 162 The Coastal Act did not 'dictate that a local government must build a hotel and conference center,' 163 but RHNA laws do dictate that a local government must plan for a specific amount of housing. 164 Despite the factual similarities to Yost , the adoption and amendment of a housing element fall into the Simpson v.

california_law_review_voter-pay,"This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials' perception of the 'median voter' away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",body_text,text,0.9896337249481686,0.0,2.0

california_law_review_voter-pay,"Level-up thinking is highly relevant to a voter incentive program. The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in cities and states that have significantly reduced barriers to voting. Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for smalldollar donors. 26 Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors. 27 Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result in greater progress towards achieving a representative electorate and ultimately addressing democratic imbalance. A great policy proposal that leverages this type of level-up thinking to address electoral imbalance is the Mobilization Matching Fund, proposed by Professor Bertrall Ross II. 28 This policy would use federal dollars to match campaign expenditures used to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent electoral participation, commonly referred to as 'low-propensity voters.' 29",body_text,text,0.9950909615939936,17.0,54.0

california_law_review_voter-pay,"Microeconomic theory may provide some insight into low turnout rates. Market-based theories posit that an individual will act based on the perceived utility of their action. For example, numerous political science models have used these same theories to explain why an individual chooses to stay home on election day. 41 Such theories weigh factors like a voter's perceived benefit, duty, or probability of casting the decisive vote against the costs of voting, like waiting in line or skipping work. 42",body_text,text,0.992063492063492,24.0,81.0
california_law_review_voter-pay,"Two specific economic frameworks help to explain why a voter may choose to stay home and indicate that an incentive program may alter that decision: positive externality problems and collective action problems. First, voting may suffer from a positive externality problem. A positive externality is 'a consequence or side effect of one's economic activity' that 'benefits' an individual or individuals other than the person engaging in the economic activity. 43 These spillover benefits are 'external' because at scale they accrue to society's benefit; the individual voter does not realize the benefit upon casting their vote. 44 In a theoretical exploration of positive externalities and voting, Stefan Krasa and Mattias Polborn have described this phenomenon as follows: Assume two candidates, A and B , are running for office. About 60 percent of the population supports Candidate A , but, in a hypothetical match-up, Candidate A wins by only one vote. Many of Candidate A 's supporters stayed home. Those who turned out to vote for Candidate A impose a positive externality on society by electing the general population's preferred candidate. 45",body_text,text,0.922608695652174,25.0,82.0

When a voter-let's call her Jane-casts her ballot, she does not immediately reap the benefits of Candidate A 's economic program; the program could take years to enact. Thus, the immediate benefit that Jane derives from voting is quite low. Jane will consider the costs of voting-driving to the polls, waiting in line, missing work-and may decide to stay home. 46 If, say, Jane's family and friends make the same decision, participation will fall, and Candidate B might win.

But if Jane sees an immediate and tangible benefit for her vote, here a small payment, her decision to stay home might change.

As discussed in Part II.B, a $20 subsidy to the voter may internalize the positive externalities of voting at the individual level. Similarly, requiring localities to pay for such a program may internalize the negative externalities of abundant elections at the governmental level.

california_law_review_voter-pay,"Two factors may exacerbate the credit-claiming risk. First, the risk increases as the dollar amount the government pays increases. A voter might feel more thankful to a politician for a $500 check than they would for a $20 check. A solution to this risk is to keep the payment amount relatively small, an approach that comports with similar policies that reward individuals for fulfilling their constitutional duties. For example, in California, jurors receive no more than $15 per day for their jury service. 94 Second, the credit-claiming risk may rise in states and localities where a single party dominates the electoral process. For example, in New York, the Democratic Party controlled forty-five of the fifty-one city council seats following the 2023 election. 95 There, voters may associate a policy with the Democratic Party, whose officials may in turn use that association to further entrench their power. While this concern may be valid, it stems more from the United States's increased geographic political polarization rather than from the voter incentive policy itself.

Officials worried that nefarious actors-be they self-interested party officials, racist white voters, or bothwould use every means at their disposal to corrupt the Black vote. 120 Many found this concern compelling. 121 Others worried that one corrupted vote 122 effectively nullified a validly cast vote. 123 In either instance, the amendment's primary purpose sought to fortify electoral integrity.",body_text,text,0.900198281559815,64.0,219.0

For children commuting alone or spending significant time in transit, AVs may become spaces where they complete homework, communicate with friends, nap, change clothes for extracurriculars, or process personal emotions. Survey data reveals that individuals already regularly engage in a wide range of intimate activities within their vehicles-from routine behaviors like eating and communicating to more private activities such as sleeping, changing clothes, and engaging in sexual activities. AVs will only amplify this trend, and make cars even more dwelling-like by freeing up passengers from tasks related to driving. This shift toward treating vehicles as personal living spaces heightens the need for privacy protections. Privacy concerns affect all vehicle occupants, but they become particularly acute for children, whose developmental stage makes them especially vulnerable to privacy intrusions.

These developmental processes include identity exploration, role experimentation, and the formation of a coherent self-concept. Privacy plays a crucial role in this process, as it provides adolescents with the space to experiment with different self-presentations and develop their unique identity away from constant adult scrutiny. This experimentation involves gradually taking on more responsibilities and making choices about their future, which requires a degree of freedom from parental control and often a shift in attachment to peers. Unfortunately, current research on teen technology often takes a misguided 'risk-centric' approach. But restricting children's participation in an effort to protect them may, ironically, lead to greater long-term risks. For children, surveillance instills a sense of mistrust and suspicion, conditions that can ultimately breed the very misbehavior that authorities are seeking to prevent.

A homeowner who must disclose the presence of termites saves a potential buyer, and perhaps many such buyers, from spending money to search, or inspect, the property. Similarly, requirements to reveal expected miles per gallon, or risks posed by a drug, economize on search costs. But these examples point to simple strategies and costs that can be minimized or entirely avoided with some legal intervention.

Admittedly, this requires the decision-maker to know the size of the field. It might be determined by nature, by reasonable deadlines for applicants, or by the cost of inspecting alternatives. A key insight concerns determining the optimal size of the sample set. An interviewer offered eight prospects should inspect three (1/e of the available group to be precise 2 ) and then stop when observing the first subsequent interviewee who is better than the best in that sample of three. The decision-maker is thus limited to pairwise comparisons, a feature that may be convenient to decision-makers who have trouble keeping many things in mind at once. This strategy avoids cycling if there are three or more decision-makers because the choice is between just two options in any one step. Moreover, there is no returning to options passed by, just as rules against reconsideration avoid evidence of cycling and indeterminacy in deliberative groups governed by the usual rules of order.",body_text,text,0.7948051948051948,2.0,8.0

The goal is to find the best in the A-H group of eight. Given the assumptions, this strategy is superior to any other in finding the best choice. The strategy fails when the best is in the ABC sample group, and it is also likely to fail when the best applicant is found late in the group. Thus, G might be the best, but it was dismissed once E was discovered to be better than any in the ABC group. Note, with some relief and some relaxation of the stated goal of finding the very best in the available group, that E is quite likely to be the second best if it is not the very best.

In turn, the insights are likely to shed light on legal interventions in the interest of consumer welfare. This Essay begins by sidelining optimal stopping in Part I. Optimal stopping theory is reintroduced in Part V after some discussion of Diamond-price-adjustments in Part II as well as search costs more generally, and particularly the disinclination of a first mover to be disadvantaged by a kind of free riding that this Essay will call 'uncompensated sampling.' For example, an interviewer who has no intention of hiring the first two candidates but uses them to sample the available pool and then follow the optimal stopping strategy is imposing costs on the candidates in the sample. Eventually, this Essay expands these ideas by considering two-sided search problems in Part V; a buyer might be searching for better prices, while the seller is also searching for a buyer that will produce the greatest profit. This two-sided inspection of search costs is new to law and economics. The examination of search and price adjustments offers serious implications for antitrust and other law.

chicago_law_review_search-strategy-sampling-and-competition-law,"Setting optimal stopping strategies aside allows us to concentrate on other insights from search theory. The analysis here begins with a buyer's search strategy, as if the seller is not also searching among potential bidders, or buyers. Put differently, most transactions involve two-sided search processes; the buyer searches for the best price (not to mention other features), and the seller evaluates buyers to set prices and decide when to accept offers. Still, it will be useful at the outset to view search costs from just one perspective. When optimal stopping is incorporated late in this Essay, along with a two-sided analysis, the number of balls in the air is greatly increased, and conclusions are hazy. This may be why the existing literature generally treats the problem as one-sided. In the case of understanding a firm's hiring process, for example-a typical application of optimal stopping-the focus has been on the employer's decision in hiring from a set of applicants who can be interviewed. The analysis here does the same, at least at first, ignoring the idea that the typical applicant is also choosing how many employers to consider and when to accept an offer rather than continue searching. Similarly, as we will see in the context of competition law, it is a leap (and a goal here) to think about buyers' choosing how many sellers to consider, but a further (usually ignored) leap would consider a seller's shopping strategy with multiple potential buyers-even if it is only to 'interview' them as to the price they would pay.

These are very different markets, and yet all involve costly searching by many buyers. To add to the fun, most of these markets reflect a degree of two-sided searching. The applicant searches for a better price from competing schools, and the schools search for applicants of various types. Similarly, a high school football star searches among universities to attend, while a given university in search of a talented football quarterback does not need to pay for many of these.

chicago_law_review_search-strategy-sampling-and-competition-law,"A store that carries large kitchen appliances observes customers looking around, and making more than one visit, before they are ready to make a significant purchase. The store absorbs a cost by serving in the 'sample.' In many markets this is of limited concern because the store that is sampled is at least as likely to benefit from the sampling role played by competitors who are used by other shoppers. Similarly, a homebuyer might see a house that looked pretty good and might let it pass by without buying or bidding for it because the buyer wants to develop some knowledge about comparable houses that are available. At some point the buyer who, following the conventional assumption in the literature, can only keep a couple of houses in mind at once, stops and chooses a house that is superior to the one most preferred in the 'sample' of those examined earlier. This may be because the buyer cannot keep more than a few houses in mind. It may also be because the potential buyer knows that by passing on an opportunity, the house under consideration might be sold to someone else before it can be reconsidered. This is less likely in the case of a washing machine, but even there a model might disappear from the market. It is easy to object to assumptions embedded in this description of comparison shopping. A sophisticated buyer might, for example, try to pay a potential seller to keep an opportunity open. The buyer might seek a right of first refusal to ensure that the home (or even the dishwasher) will not be sold quickly while the buyer is searching for the perfect home at a great price. This is easier for houses than it is for yet larger 'goods,' like target corporations, even though those searches might be mostly about price from the perspective of another corporation or venture capitalist.",body_text,text,0.9933957072096864,10.0,23.0

This is not a strategy yet observed-even in law school admissions, where admissions officers regularly complain that prospective students, seeking to 'buy' a spot in the class at a lower price, ask School #2 to match or beat an offer made by School #1. School #2 could charge for its improved offer both to earn money and to avoid uncompensated sampling by an applicant who intends to take this information from #2 to bargain with School #1 or even #3.

chicago_law_review_search-strategy-sampling-and-competition-law,"There are similar examples in the world of corporate acquisitions. Once an acquirer signals interest, there is an increased chance that another bidder will appear and benefit the target's shareholders. First movers have invested in studying potential targets, and they do not want their efforts to be used by other bidders who do not compensate the first mover. Any rules here can be understood as part of what we call competition law, as well as corporate law. Bidder #1 tries to get lockups or other devices that discourage other bids, or they seek ways of being paid for their first bids and their identification of a worthy target. They might have bought stock in the target and are then rewarded for their earlier search when #2 buys their stock at a higher price. (This comes closer to the idea for law school admissions officers.) Several well-known corporate law cases, such as Smith v. Van Gorkom (Del. 1985), involve a bidder's trying to finalize a takeover before another, often emulating, acquirer can enter the field. Once the second arrives, and an auction is in progress, current law all but forbids the managers of the target from interfering. The rule might benefit shareholders of the target in question, but it can discourage searches for viable targets in the future. Indeed, much of the analysis here, aimed at conventional competition law, can be applied to corporate law, where the regulatory apparatus is a combination of Delaware (or other state) law along with federal law that often requires equal payments to target shareholders. It goes without saying that the more Bidder #2 gains information, at no cost, from #1, the first mover, there will be a disinclination to go first.

For example, architects put in effort to secure contracts. Clients would like to see competing plans and prices, but architects are hesitant to put in effort if they only have a modest chance of success. The problem is partly solved by inviting architects to submit preliminary plans and then to invite just two or three to be finalists. Still, major architects do not want to enter these competitions unless winning comes with a large reward, in terms of money or reputation, to compensate for the effort put into unsuccessful proposals. Some architects charge for plans they deliver. Should law schools simply charge when an admitted student asks that the scholarship awarded be reconsidered and increased? Most clients will not simply pay for all architectural proposals, because (again) firms might put insufficient effort into plans just to earn the fee.

The problem is not simply overcome by the client's promising an add-on reward to the winner, because the second-best bidder will offer a better price in as much as the effort it put into its proposal is now a sunk cost. In the case of law school admissions, applicants put little effort into the marginal application, so the problem is different. Still, the suggestion offered earlier might have some promise with respect to large contracts with substantial application costs. A buyer (or even a target corporation) that receives a first offer might stipulate that it invites competition; it will pay for any bid that is better than the earlier bids. One objection to this idea, or explanation for why it has not materialized in the market, is that it is then unattractive to be the first bidder. As with corporate takeovers and many job offers, the one who invests first is at risk of providing uncompensated sampling; others can benefit from the information the first mover provides. And yet it is difficult to charge for getting things started because the paying party will fear that that the first mover will do just enough to earn the promised fee.

Lucky for us, we live in a time when we can usually find prices online, so that search costs for some goods (e.g., on Amazon) are close to zero, but let's continue to assume that sellers are not bound by previously posted prices and that online shopping will not suffice in some markets. There is some reason to think that sellers who do not honor previously posted prices by adjusting downwards will lose in the market, but as every shopper knows this is a weak claim. For some goods, as with cars and kitchen appliances, many buyers want to see the good they contemplate buying, and many buyers can bargain prices down. For other expensive goods, like Lasik surgery, this is simply not possible; the seller needs to see the prospective patient and the buyer might want to meet the doctor and thus see part of the 'good' being offered.

The chocolates come in various stores, but even in one store, perhaps in an airport's duty-free shop, you can find different prices, brands, calories, colors, packaging, varieties, and so forth. How do you choose? It is difficult though not exactly costly to consider all the attributes, and you might want to weigh their importance to you. The superrational thing to do, at least if there is a single decision-maker to avoid cycling among three or more alternatives, is to make a spreadsheet and list the attributes that matter. You might give them appropriate weights, study all the packages, record the information, and assign scores. You then total the scores and choose the one with the highest score. We all know people who accept or reject job offers this way. They consider salaries, locations, opportunities for advancement, branding, vacation days offered, and so forth.

The problem in the airport, as described here, is that there are many variables. The suggestion is that you first think about these variables and decide which is most important to you. At step two, you 'take-the-best' judged by this variable. The psychology literature likes the example of buying milk at a large grocery store.

In a competitive market, entrants appear to satisfy fringe tastes. A monopolist has less incentive to do so, unless fringe buyers will vanish. This is easily tested. If a vacation spot has three ice cream stores, they are predicted to offer more flavors than a monopolist in a comparable town some distance away. This is because we imagine someone who loves passion fruit to settle for strawberry when the former is unavailable. The consumer loss from the monopoly is difficult to measure because it is about choices rather than prices. It is, more generally, about reduced innovation, but that is a familiar topic in antitrust.

Sellers are aware of this, to be sure, and the marketing literature is full of ideas about how to position and advertise goods based on surveys and observations about buyers' shortcuts. Strangely, this literature largely ignores the fact that the supermarket or other property owner also knows about the value of the best shelf space and will adjust prices accordingly. If so, it is not clear why the marketing department is terribly useful. But returning to the buyer's behavior, it is surely the case that people modify take-the-best and look at two rather than one variable among many.

Indeed, it is observable that the cost of commercial property decreases with distance from the exit ramp. Perhaps A charges $4.70 per gallon, but you are a tourist and do not know whether much better prices are available in this state. The stations are a quarter mile apart, so you need to drive on to see the prices at the other stations. 5 When the cost is low, optimal stopping theory seems like a better tool than what we have examined to this point.

But gas stations are not like that-if E is last, and there are many determined shoppers, it will pay for E to have the highest price because searching (returning to B or D) is very costly. E might charge the most but get the least business.

If ABCD are pricing at $4.10, $4.30, $4.50, and $4.70, for example, and we focus on E's strategy along with appropriate search costs, the chance that the sample group, randomly chosen by the buyer, was AB is not very high. There is no need to choose $4.00 in order to be the lowest price. Similarly, $4.40 is unlikely to be the right choice because that requires the sample group to contain CD exactly (with prices of $4.50 and $4.70). Imagine E chooses $4.20 in order to fit between $4.10 and $4.30. If E is in the sample group, E knows that its decision does not matter. Note that this is better for consumers than what we saw without randomization regarding the starting point for the search process.

The seller can start with a high price and then observe offers made by potential buyers. It is no surprise that this resembles a Dutch Auction. The seller in a conventional shop creates a sample of buyers, before putting items on 'sale.' This is not unlike the way an employer, looking to hire one person, might investigate a sample group of job applicants, before taking the first applicant who is superior to the best observed in the sample. Anyone who has sold a house (other than in localities where auctions among bidding buyers are the norm) is familiar with this sort of updating as offers come in from potential buyers.

This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support expansive property protections. Specifically, property interests could be underprotected by general property law's interaction with the background principles exception. To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims. These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to be over inclusive of background principles, as it necessitates a high level of generality. Second, placing the burden on plaintiffs to preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor.

In this context, Baker and Slaybaugh serve as valuable early examples of how general law background principles function, foreshadowing how the general law method which some have mistakenly understood to be limited to protecting property in gamesmanship cases 165 can be used to deny takings claims. 166 They do so not only as mere data points, but also as illustrations of a few features of the general law approach to background principles that could systematically undercut property protections.",body_text,text,0.9935483870967742,46.0,256.0

Baker and Slaybaugh illustrate that the general law approach, because it is fundamentally an exercise in abstraction, can result in more expansive background limitations on property rights (and therefore less property protection). A familiar theme in constitutional law is that as a principle's level of generality increases, so too do the number of particular cases that it covers. 167 In the background principles context, increased abstraction can mean more limitations on property interests and less Takings Clause protection. That general law background principles would be more abstract than statespecific ones is intuitive: When courts attempt to analyze the laws of jurisdictions in times and places near and far, a higher level of generality is needed to make those disparate laws all cognizable as part of a single, all-encompassing background principle. In Baker , for example, the necessity exception was distilled into a highly general rule that left the meaning of 'emergency' and 'necessity' the principle's two key",body_text,text,0.914855072463768,47.0,257.0

Although the Restatements in which Cedar Point , Baker , and Slaybaugh found background principles are useful sources for studying a given body of law's general principles, they are written at a high level of abstraction and thus do not encompass any single jurisdiction's nuanced common law. 170 Meanwhile, a more particularized inquiry into state law requires reckoning with the nuts and bolts of state statutes and common law. 171 If one concedes that increased abstraction leads to less property protection in the background-limitations context, then the courts' use of generalized sources of law only supports the conclusion that a takings doctrine based on jurisdictionless background principles poses the endemic risk of underprotecting property.",body_text,text,0.9903023388476896,48.0,265.0

Perhaps it stems naturally from the fact that background principles are antecedent to the takings analysis, such that the burden falls on the plaintiff to establish that they had a property interest in the first place. More cynically, it could be the result of the courts' squeamishness toward making definitive statements about history in these cases, so as to preserve 'flexibility' for future cases, 178 conceal operative normative judgments, 179 or avoid getting the answer wrong. 180 On this understanding, background rules would only appear categorical, but judges would exercise discretion in individual cases to determine whether a plaintiff's showing of history is 'close enough.'

The fiduciary theory of sovereignty logically follows from a modern understanding of states' rights to exercise sovereign authority. 73 It provides a framework through which international investment law can be reconciled with a state's rights and obligations to protect its population's human rights. By recognizing the state as a fiduciary, stakeholders-such as treaty drafters, investors, and arbitrators-can better understand the nature of a state's authority when negotiating and entering into IIAs.

It can be implemented through the contractual approach, which informs how specific treaty provisions in next-generation IIAs are drafted. This approach suggests that states should explicitly incorporate the fiduciary theory into new IIAs going forward. The fiduciary theory can also be incorporated into the judicial approach, which focuses on the interpretation of existing treaties. The judicial approach advocates for arbitrators to consider the fiduciary theory when interpreting IIAs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace. As already discussed, this regime is adrift when it comes to reconciling this fundamental tension.

With the fiduciary theory's clarification, the investor can better understand-and reasonably expect-what the state can, and more importantly, cannot contract away through an IIA. At its core, the fiduciary theory is about the nature of a state's sovereignty. Sovereignty is not a blank check to exercise illimitable power. Instead, it is collective power bestowed by that state's citizenry to ensure they can exercise inalienable rights. Consequently, contracting away the power to regulate in protection of a population's human rights through an IIA is clearly outside the bounds of a state's valid exercise of sovereignty. 134",body_text,text,0.8778960551033187,60.0,241.0

As a fiduciary, the government was under an express obligation to affirmatively protect this right.

As seen in Eco Oro , a treaty provision can be interpreted narrowly and in seeming contradiction to its plain meaning and purpose. 138 The effectiveness of interpretive tools such as article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 139 further depends on the willingness of a tribunal to recognize both that (a) human rights obligations constitute rules, and (b) that they are relevant to the present dispute. 140 Even when a tribunal acknowledges a human right's existence, as observed in Suez , 141 a tribunal may still enforce conflicting obligations owed to an investor.

It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases-primarily at the circuit court level-which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",body_text,text,0.9979423868312756,1.0,21.0

Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders' involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges.

What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts' current expectations.

Good cause rulemaking refers to the exception articulated in the APA that allows an agency to forgo notice and comment 'when the agency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.' 75 The exception has been invoked and litigated in a number of lower court cases, 76 but the exact meaning of 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest' has not been addressed by the Supreme Court, 77 leaving it unclear exactly when agencies can use the good cause exception. 78 Given the challenges with notice and comment, the issue seems ripe for review. However, even if the Court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking. They should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself.

The Biden Administration approached this prong as an opportunity to meet with 'community organizations and data users to discuss the various changes . . . and to ensure that stakeholders understand' how a new rule or regulation works. 96 These engagement efforts could mirror the listening sessions, town halls, and direct outreach that take place during rulemaking. But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA's original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers' lives simpler. Although this step seems unnecessary for an agency rulemaking to survive judicial review, it is nonetheless recommended.",body_text,text,0.9782840868636524,45.0,189.0

The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure.

michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Constitutionality is one thing; accuracy is another. The law enforcement privilege risks entrenching investigative methods and forms of evidence that are flawed or inaccurate by preventing defendants from putting them to the test. The privilege (like privileges generally) applies to every stage of a case, from pretrial suppression motions to post-conviction proceedings. 40 Hence, the privilege can block adversarial scrutiny of investigative methods even when the results of those methods are introduced as part of the government's case-in-chief at trial. It is worth emphasizing this point: The privilege is not just an issue at suppression hearings; it also reaches substantive evidence of guilt or innocence. When the results of a method are ultimately introduced at trial, the method veers from investigative to forensic. 41 In such circumstances, the law enforcement privilege still applies. Hence, the law enforcement privilege also risks propagating flawed or fraudulent forensic methods and unreliable evidence at trial.",body_text,text,0.8894806924101198,12.0,75.0

That view is almost certainly wrong and invites a naïve underestimation of the privilege's intractability.

Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 In all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102",body_text,text,0.7691309987029832,30.0,165.0

These heightened protections impose wellrecognized costs on the accuracy and fairness of adjudicatory outcomes because they necessarily suppress relevant evidence from the opposing party, judge, and jury alike. In the Supreme Court's oft-repeated words, privileges 'are in derogation of the search for truth.' 115 Privilege law attempts to balance those costs against the benefits that privileges supposedly provide for social policies that are extrinsic to the truth-seeking function of the courts.

For instance, courts have declined to categorically refute claims that the privilege shields the type of batteries used in an audio recording device, 131 or 'the charts, graphs, and raw data' generated during a polygraph examination. 132 Shielding this type of information from adversarial scrutiny can enable tragic misconduct. Consider that, in July 2023, the Third Circuit found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a detective fabricated polygraph evidence, which led to an innocent man's wrongful eleven-year prison sentence. 133 A privilege sweeping enough to encompass polygraph data can prevent that type of misconduct from ever coming to light. Yet critics have complained that courts 'apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,' 134 and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion. 135",body_text,text,0.7869507323568575,38.0,210.0

Criminal defendants sometimes have legitimate interests in accessing information about law enforcement methods, and police and prosecutors sometimes have legitimate interests in withholding that information. Yet, empowering the state to keep this information secret creates the risk that the secrecy power will be abused. Meanwhile, judges deciding whether to uphold a privilege claim must resolve an issue of specialized expertise without the benefits of a full adversarial process to educate them about the law and facts. The result leaves courts in a bind and disadvantages the entire truth-seeking process in cases that implicate life, liberty, and police accountability.",body_text,text,1.0,83.0,440.0

Federal appellate case law simply reiterates the privilege's policy rationale as the test for asserting threshold claims and, consequently, imposes virtually no meaningful constraint on law enforcement's secrecy power. The policy rationale supposedly motivating the privilege-that disclosure of investigative methods would risk countermeasures-could theoretically apply to almost any investigative technique. Vagueness invites law enforcement to overclaim the privilege, whether to conceal mistakes and negligence, to hide unlawful and unconstitutional conduct, or simply to avoid the hassle and inconvenience of having investigative methods challenged in court.

Courts should demand to know how law enforcement previously treated the allegedly privileged information. As an initial matter, if law enforcement failed to take reasonable care before coming to court, then in most cases judges should be able to avoid the difficult task of digging further and simply default to ordering disclosure. Second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access. Here is a simple procedure to do so. Courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford. If judges can craft a protective order that matches or exceeds the protections that law enforcement previously imposed, then ordering disclosure would not create a significant new risk of leaks and courts should, once again, default to ordering disclosure.",body_text,text,0.999124343257443,91.0,476.0

According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",body_text,text,0.9484612532443456,112.0,567.0

Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals' incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their postdispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article's reform proposal will offer no benefit.",body_text,text,0.9963689179375452,113.0,568.0

On the contrary, the vagueness of current doctrine is judge-made and arguably reflects a variety of institutional incentives shared by many members of the judiciary. As Ana Lvovsky has articulated especially well, judges' motives for deferring to law enforcement are numerous and can include political pressures; personal ideological sympathies; pragmatic sensitivity to the challenges of policing; a desire to manage caseloads by simplifying or avoiding otherwise 'sticky legal issues'; a preference for disposing of issues through 'procedural lenience' towards the police rather than potentially 'controversial or corrosive substantive holdings'; and a pull to",body_text,text,0.8031573754316724,114.0,570.0

Judges have a mix of institutional incentives, including pressures to protect the interests of criminal defendants. 361 Secrecy concerning law enforcement investigative techniques does not entirely eliminate docket-clogging motions or thorny legal and constitutional issues. Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy. Even if investigative methods are disclosed under a strict protective order, the judge's conclusions as to their lawfulness and reliability need not be.

Vagueness in the doctrine provides cover for deference. Deference, in turn, enables judges to avoid uncomfortable and time-consuming decisions. By maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes.

michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"More generally, this Article's analysis suggests a new 'circumstantial evidence' theory of confidentiality's role in privilege law as a whole, with potentially radical implications for government privilege writ large. Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties-such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges-require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that 'originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.' 369 That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist. 370",body_text,text,0.8064250411861614,123.0,594.0
michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Instead, the Article argued that courts should evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. To do this, judges should assess how law enforcement itself previously treated the purportedly privileged information. If the safeguards available through a court-ordered protective order could match or exceed law enforcement's own prior confidentiality requirements, courts should default to ordering disclosure. This approach has substantive, institutional, procedural, and normative advantages.

The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information.

The Offset Provision cases produced two general categories of sovereign injuries, styled here as the 'Spending Contract' injury and the 'Tax Power' injury. The Spending Contract injury, the asserted basis for standing in the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, 20 focuses on the offer : Congress offends state sovereignty when it offers federal funds with coercive or ambiguous spending conditions. 21 The Tax Power injury-a 'plus factor' for standing in the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits-focuses on the subject matter : States can challenge congressional exercises of the Spending Clause that constrain certain sovereign prerogatives, like the power to tax. 22",body_text,text,0.7875457875457875,10.0,53.0
michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing,"Although it is true that states suffer some form of sovereign injury when Congress exceeds its spending power, most of the Offset Provision decisions are simply too broad. An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something-anything-'sovereign' enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on 'dubious' and 'lawless' standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them. Because Congress often relies on its spending power for modern legislation, 24 an expansive 'welcome' mat into federal court risks further turning the judiciary into the arbiter of policy battles. 25",body_text,text,0.84472049689441,11.0,55.0

Professor Jonathan Gould explains that in recent decades, Congress's ability to regulate through other Article I powers has faced greater challenges under judicial review, with the Supreme Court crafting limitations on Congress's interstate commerce power and in other constitutional doctrines such as anticommandeering and nondelegation. 85 For better or worse, the Spending Clause is one of the federal government's few remaining means to reliably effectuate welfarist policies on a national scale. Furthermore, even in the hands of a Congress uninterested in redistributive policies, the fourth prong of Dole -that spending conditions cannot require states to engage in unconstitutional behavior-prevents serious threats against individual liberties. 86",body_text,text,0.9506334643949322,29.0,142.0

Indeed, those courts also held mostly for the state plaintiffs on the merits. Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes-in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a 'sovereign' policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",body_text,text,0.9857493857493858,49.0,250.0

To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a 'social currency' that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injurycausing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations.

The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury.

Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant's culpability.

Consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff's impaired interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm. In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. 'Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.' Id. These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff's protected, injured interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner. The burden of proof then maintains the integrity of this priority. The plaintiff must prove the elements of the prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence. When the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.

Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare.

michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources,"Although this compensatory form of strict liability now has limited application, it has an important implication for the normative properties of tort law. A purely compensatory tort rule, by definition, is wholly justified in terms of fair or reasonable injury compensation and not by injury deterrence (unlike negligence and related rules of strict liability formulated to overcome the evidentiary hurdles of proving negligence liability). A purely compensatory tort rule is allocatively inefficient: The compensatory transfer merely shifts the injury costs from one party to the other while creating the associated transaction costs. In the absence of deterrence, social costs are minimized by letting the loss fall on the injured accident victim. How, then, can a compensatory rule of strict liability be squared with the normative calculus of tort law defined in terms of both welfarist and nonwelfarist rationales for tort liability?",body_text,text,1.0,167.0,429.0

In the same way that deterrence can justifiably shape tort law even if tort liability does not optimally deter, the ideal of full compensation embodied in the Pareto principle can justifiably shape tort law under second-best conditions of imperfect injury compensation.

PROBS., no. 2, 2014, at 165 (showing how a compensatory norm generates tort rules that adequately satisfy the demands of the Pareto principle for social interactions constrained by transaction costs). As for the central normative importance of the Pareto principle for welfarist interpretations of tort law, see LOUIS KAPLOW & STEVEN SHAVELL, FAIRNESS VERSUS WELFARE 54-56, 54 n.76 (2002) for an argument that any nonwelfarist rationale for tort law violates the Pareto principle and should be rejected for that reason.",footnote,footnote,0.9262926292629264,165.0,432.0
michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources,"In yet one more respect, then, the problem of scarce compensatory resources alters the normative calculus of tort law in a predictable way that conventional tort theories have not recognized. Like duty-bearers, right-holders do not have unlimited compensatory resources and accordingly have a reasonable interest in minimizing their injury compensation costs. For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder's total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrencebased liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",body_text,text,0.9985948477751756,169.0,434.0

For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 387, 394-96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder's willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.",footnote,footnote,0.9790393013100436,166.0,437.0

In this, the congressional OLCs set a precedent for other components of the congressional bureaucracy-for example, CRS-that have been stymied by a kind of hyperneutrality that demands that congressional bureaucrats avoid answering consequential questions entirely.

yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War,"abstract. Each day, the news brings stories of military attacks on schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, electrical facilities, and other critical civilian infrastructure. The militaries attacking these objects often seek to justify the attacks by claiming that the civilian objects are being used by militants. Objects that are believed to have both military and civilian use are often referred to as 'dual-use' objects. Even though the term has become common, international law does not recognize a 'dual-use' object as a legally meaningful category. Rather, the postwar Geneva Conventions that lie at the core of modern international humanitarian law establish a bright line between 'military objectives' that are considered legitimate targets of military force, and civilians and 'civilian objects, ' which are to be strictly protected.",body_text,text,0.9899109792284868,0.0,3.0
yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War,"Weshow in this Article that the targeting of dual-use objects over the last several decades has blurred this line, placing civilians at great risk. The United States has played a critical role in the increasingly expansive targeting of dual-use objects. Indeed, most accounts of the origins of dualuse targeting start with the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led coalition responded to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait with airstrikes on Iraq's electrical infrastructure and bridges. The Article reviews the history of dual-use targeting and presents an original dataset and primary-source evidence from the sites of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2018 to illustrate the wide range of dual-use objects that the U.S. military has struck. It draws on ground reporting and research to show the true costs of this dual-use targeting for civilians living in areas of conflict. The United States is far from alone in targeting dual-use objects, but we focus on it because it shapes the law of armed conflict by projecting force around the world, providing legal justifications for its use of force, and setting the standards by which other states are measured. Finally, this Article recommends that states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects so that they can make better-informed targeting decisions. We also offer several recommendations for clarifying international humanitarian law to prevent further erosion of the protections the law provides to civilians during war.",body_text,text,0.998032786885246,1.0,4.0

The United States deployed the concept in the context of air warfare during the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led coalition's response to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait included airstrikes on Iraq's electrical infrastructure and bridges. 25 The practice became widespread in the decades following the 9/11 attacks, as the United States waged war against nonstate armed groups, the members of which are often embedded in and difficult to distinguish from the civilian population. 26 The difficulty of distinguishing between combatants and civilians and between military objectives and civilian objects is especially pronounced in conflicts involving nonstate armed groups that capture territory and attempt to govern civilian populations, including conflicts involving al-Qaeda and ISIS. 27",body_text,text,0.7888611803823774,9.0,56.0

We thus recommendthat states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects that are critical to civilian well-being in areas of conflict so that they can anticipate, and take steps to mitigate, the impact of their targeting decisions on civilians.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"abstract. For incarcerated people litigating pro se, the civil discovery process is vitally important. When imprisoned litigants lack meaningful access to discovery, their cases become swearing contests they are bound to lose, and wrongdoing in prison goes unaddressed. Yet for these same plaintiffs, civil discovery is defunct. The vast majority of incarcerated plaintiffs, including those with promising or meritorious claims, are unable to navigate either to or through litigation's discovery phase. Part diagnosis and part treatment, this Article is the first to explore in depth how the discovery process fails those pursuing civil-rights claims against their jailers, revealing both a crisis in prison litigation and a failure of our procedural regime.",body_text,text,0.9986807387862796,0.0,3.0

This research reveals differences between the districts' case-management decisions and cultures, resulting in startling disparities in prison litigants' discovery prospects. Incarcerated litigants' current chances of evidencing and vindicating claims may be largely contingent on the district in which their prison sits-what some incarcerated people call 'justice by jurisdiction.

It then discusses the much broader amalgam of practical impediments to evidence gathering in prison.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"Part I explores the written rules governing prison litigation, including the scant few bearing on discovery. It begins by surveying the impoverished legal options available to those who wish to resist the harsh conditions of their confinement in federal court. The barriers are twofold: many of prison's indignities simply lie outside the scope of federal causes of action, and for those few who can locate a cognizable claim, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)-a 1996 law aimed at stemming frivolous prison litigation-makes its vindication nearly impossible, imposing procedural hurdles at litigation's earliest phases. 58 Most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims thus fail before discovery even begins. For the few cases that emerge, effective discovery is of vital importance: having survived the PLRA's hurdles, these are the cases that everyone agrees could well be nonfrivolous-ample reason they be properly evidenced and heard. For these cases, discovery promises fairness, exposure, and regulation sorely needed in the carceral context.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"Part II turns to the unwritten rules that cement discovery's failures for those plaintiffs who do access the process, relying on case research and dozens of interviews with formerly incarcerated people, federal magistrate and district judges, staff attorneys, civil-rights lawyers, and prison officials. 59 This Part begins by outlining the predictable evidentiary needs undergirding most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims. These needs are not inherently harder to fulfill in the prison context; the problem instead lies in the practical constraints hindering the process. Security concerns make a significant share of relevant evidence simply undiscoverable. And since prisons control the creation and storage of most evidence-surveillance footage, written incident reports, and the likenegligence or ill will can mean the disappearance of (or the failure ever to produce) vital information. Resource restrictions make valuable discovery tools like depositions and expert reports inaccessible to imprisoned litigants, shutting off any real hope of poking holes in a defendant's story or proving a doctor's indifference to a medical condition. And hostility between incarcerated people and their jailers breeds distrust, foot-dragging, and credible allegations of spoliation. Together, these difficulties are different in both degree and kind from those faced by other pro se litigants and civil-rights plaintiffs. The Article thus draws the unavoidable conclusion that the aspirationally transsubstantive Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wholly disserve prison litigation. Without unique intervention, no meaningful opportunity exists for incarcerated plaintiffs to evidence their claims. Through this lens, the Article contributes to ongoing efforts to distinguish law in theory from law in practice 60 and joins a mounting chorus of",body_text,text,0.9733475479744136,33.0,151.0

First, courts should, where resources permit, be far more open to recruiting counsel for imprisoned plaintiffs embarking upon discovery. Second, courts should standardize the discovery process in prison litigation, creating certain tailored discovery rules for imprisoned litigants' claims. Third, judges should intervene through telephonic status conferences to advise plaintiffs on the process and ensure that they are not floundering or getting the runaround. Fourth, courts should take creative approaches to widening the availability of discovery tools, including making use of new technology to broaden incarcerated litigants' access to oral depositions. And finally, there should be efforts both in and out of court to police the creation, storage, and disclosure of evidence. This includes spoliation sanctions or curative measures when prisons overwrite surveillance footage after someone has filed a grievance implicating that footage. It also means devising standardized protocols for flagging evidence that poses security risks, along with safe procedures to handle that evidence's production and use.
