harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property,"The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, it must compensate the property owner. 1 One exception to this rule, the 'background principles' exception, establishes that 'the government does not take a property interest when it merely asserts a 'pre-existing limitation upon the land owner's title.'' 2 For instance, if a landowner is creating a nuisance on his property, the government owes him no compensation for forcing him to stop, 'because he never had the right to engage in the nuisance in the first place.' 3 The concept is simple: One cannot lose what was never his. 4",body_text,text,0.9831288343558282,0.0,1.0

This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support expansive property protections. Specifically, property interests could be underprotected by general property law's interaction with the background principles exception. To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims. These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to be over inclusive of background principles, as it necessitates a high level of generality. Second, placing the burden on plaintiffs to preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor.

In this context, Baker and Slaybaugh serve as valuable early examples of how general law background principles function, foreshadowing how the general law method which some have mistakenly understood to be limited to protecting property in gamesmanship cases 165 can be used to deny takings claims. 166 They do so not only as mere data points, but also as illustrations of a few features of the general law approach to background principles that could systematically undercut property protections.",body_text,text,0.9935483870967742,46.0,256.0

Baker and Slaybaugh illustrate that the general law approach, because it is fundamentally an exercise in abstraction, can result in more expansive background limitations on property rights (and therefore less property protection). A familiar theme in constitutional law is that as a principle's level of generality increases, so too do the number of particular cases that it covers. 167 In the background principles context, increased abstraction can mean more limitations on property interests and less Takings Clause protection. That general law background principles would be more abstract than statespecific ones is intuitive: When courts attempt to analyze the laws of jurisdictions in times and places near and far, a higher level of generality is needed to make those disparate laws all cognizable as part of a single, all-encompassing background principle. In Baker , for example, the necessity exception was distilled into a highly general rule that left the meaning of 'emergency' and 'necessity' the principle's two key",body_text,text,0.9148550724637681,47.0,257.0

Although the Restatements in which Cedar Point , Baker , and Slaybaugh found background principles are useful sources for studying a given body of law's general principles, they are written at a high level of abstraction and thus do not encompass any single jurisdiction's nuanced common law. 170 Meanwhile, a more particularized inquiry into state law requires reckoning with the nuts and bolts of state statutes and common law. 171 If one concedes that increased abstraction leads to less property protection in the background-limitations context, then the courts' use of generalized sources of law only supports the conclusion that a takings doctrine based on jurisdictionless background principles poses the endemic risk of underprotecting property.",body_text,text,0.9903023388476897,48.0,265.0

Perhaps it stems naturally from the fact that background principles are antecedent to the takings analysis, such that the burden falls on the plaintiff to establish that they had a property interest in the first place. More cynically, it could be the result of the courts' squeamishness toward making definitive statements about history in these cases, so as to preserve 'flexibility' for future cases, 178 conceal operative normative judgments, 179 or avoid getting the answer wrong. 180 On this understanding, background rules would only appear categorical, but judges would exercise discretion in individual cases to determine whether a plaintiff's showing of history is 'close enough.'

The fiduciary theory of sovereignty logically follows from a modern understanding of states' rights to exercise sovereign authority. 73 It provides a framework through which international investment law can be reconciled with a state's rights and obligations to protect its population's human rights. By recognizing the state as a fiduciary, stakeholders-such as treaty drafters, investors, and arbitrators-can better understand the nature of a state's authority when negotiating and entering into IIAs. Furthermore, this theory clarifies that IIAs cannot be interpreted in a way that puts a domestic population's human rights in conflict with a foreign investor's rights under an IIA.",body_text,text,0.7932038834951456,26.0,130.0

A government may, in theory, run the same risks of an agency problem as a corporate board. Government officials can have interests that differ from the citizenry that they represent-they could be courted by lobbyists, have financial stakes in certain industries, or have political aspirations such that they use their governing power to act in ways that are not to their constituency's direct benefit.

michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law,"The fiduciary theory has numerous potential means of adoption. It can be implemented through the contractual approach, which informs how specific treaty provisions in next-generation IIAs are drafted. This approach suggests that states should explicitly incorporate the fiduciary theory into new IIAs going forward. The fiduciary theory can also be incorporated into the judicial approach, which focuses on the interpretation of existing treaties. The judicial approach advocates for arbitrators to consider the fiduciary theory when interpreting IIAs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace. As already discussed, this regime is adrift when it comes to reconciling this fundamental tension.

With the fiduciary theory's clarification, the investor can better understand-and reasonably expect-what the state can, and more importantly, cannot contract away through an IIA. At its core, the fiduciary theory is about the nature of a state's sovereignty. Sovereignty is not a blank check to exercise illimitable power. Instead, it is collective power bestowed by that state's citizenry to ensure they can exercise inalienable rights. Consequently, contracting away the power to regulate in protection of a population's human rights through an IIA is clearly outside the bounds of a state's valid exercise of sovereignty. 134",body_text,text,0.8778960551033187,60.0,241.0

As a fiduciary, the government was under an express obligation to affirmatively protect this right. Outreach to four out of the over thirty relevant communities in a language that was not their mother tongue fails to satisfy these communities' right to consultation.

This approach thus focuses on equipping all key participants with the elements required to incorporate the theory into their international investment engagements.

As seen in Eco Oro , a treaty provision can be interpreted narrowly and in seeming contradiction to its plain meaning and purpose. 138 The effectiveness of interpretive tools such as article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 139 further depends on the willingness of a tribunal to recognize both that (a) human rights obligations constitute rules, and (b) that they are relevant to the present dispute. 140 Even when a tribunal acknowledges a human right's existence, as observed in Suez , 141 a tribunal may still enforce conflicting obligations owed to an investor.

It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases-primarily at the circuit court level-which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",body_text,text,0.9979423868312757,1.0,21.0

Unlike notice and comment, these engagement methods are minimally resource-intensive and adapted to existing twenty-first century technologies.

Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders' involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges.

What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts' current expectations.

Good cause rulemaking refers to the exception articulated in the APA that allows an agency to forgo notice and comment 'when the agency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.' 75 The exception has been invoked and litigated in a number of lower court cases, 76 but the exact meaning of 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest' has not been addressed by the Supreme Court, 77 leaving it unclear exactly when agencies can use the good cause exception. 78 Given the challenges with notice and comment, the issue seems ripe for review. However, even if the Court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking. They should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself.

The Biden Administration approached this prong as an opportunity to meet with 'community organizations and data users to discuss the various changes . . . and to ensure that stakeholders understand' how a new rule or regulation works. 96 These engagement efforts could mirror the listening sessions, town halls, and direct outreach that take place during rulemaking. But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA's original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers' lives simpler. Although this step seems unnecessary for an agency rulemaking to survive judicial review, it is nonetheless recommended.",body_text,text,0.9782840868636525,45.0,189.0

The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure.

michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Constitutionality is one thing; accuracy is another. The law enforcement privilege risks entrenching investigative methods and forms of evidence that are flawed or inaccurate by preventing defendants from putting them to the test. The privilege (like privileges generally) applies to every stage of a case, from pretrial suppression motions to post-conviction proceedings. 40 Hence, the privilege can block adversarial scrutiny of investigative methods even when the results of those methods are introduced as part of the government's case-in-chief at trial. It is worth emphasizing this point: The privilege is not just an issue at suppression hearings; it also reaches substantive evidence of guilt or innocence. When the results of a method are ultimately introduced at trial, the method veers from investigative to forensic. 41 In such circumstances, the law enforcement privilege still applies. Hence, the law enforcement privilege also risks propagating flawed or fraudulent forensic methods and unreliable evidence at trial.",body_text,text,0.8894806924101198,12.0,75.0

That view is almost certainly wrong and invites a naïve underestimation of the privilege's intractability.

Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 In all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102",body_text,text,0.7691309987029832,30.0,165.0

These heightened protections impose wellrecognized costs on the accuracy and fairness of adjudicatory outcomes because they necessarily suppress relevant evidence from the opposing party, judge, and jury alike. In the Supreme Court's oft-repeated words, privileges 'are in derogation of the search for truth.' 115 Privilege law attempts to balance those costs against the benefits that privileges supposedly provide for social policies that are extrinsic to the truth-seeking function of the courts.

For instance, courts have declined to categorically refute claims that the privilege shields the type of batteries used in an audio recording device, 131 or 'the charts, graphs, and raw data' generated during a polygraph examination. 132 Shielding this type of information from adversarial scrutiny can enable tragic misconduct. Consider that, in July 2023, the Third Circuit found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a detective fabricated polygraph evidence, which led to an innocent man's wrongful eleven-year prison sentence. 133 A privilege sweeping enough to encompass polygraph data can prevent that type of misconduct from ever coming to light. Yet critics have complained that courts 'apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,' 134 and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion. 135",body_text,text,0.7869507323568575,38.0,210.0

Criminal defendants sometimes have legitimate interests in accessing information about law enforcement methods, and police and prosecutors sometimes have legitimate interests in withholding that information. Yet, empowering the state to keep this information secret creates the risk that the secrecy power will be abused. Meanwhile, judges deciding whether to uphold a privilege claim must resolve an issue of specialized expertise without the benefits of a full adversarial process to educate them about the law and facts. The result leaves courts in a bind and disadvantages the entire truth-seeking process in cases that implicate life, liberty, and police accountability.",body_text,text,1.0,83.0,440.0

Federal appellate case law simply reiterates the privilege's policy rationale as the test for asserting threshold claims and, consequently, imposes virtually no meaningful constraint on law enforcement's secrecy power. The policy rationale supposedly motivating the privilege-that disclosure of investigative methods would risk countermeasures-could theoretically apply to almost any investigative technique. Vagueness invites law enforcement to overclaim the privilege, whether to conceal mistakes and negligence, to hide unlawful and unconstitutional conduct, or simply to avoid the hassle and inconvenience of having investigative methods challenged in court.

Courts should demand to know how law enforcement previously treated the allegedly privileged information. As an initial matter, if law enforcement failed to take reasonable care before coming to court, then in most cases judges should be able to avoid the difficult task of digging further and simply default to ordering disclosure. Second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access. Here is a simple procedure to do so. Courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford. If judges can craft a protective order that matches or exceeds the protections that law enforcement previously imposed, then ordering disclosure would not create a significant new risk of leaks and courts should, once again, default to ordering disclosure.",body_text,text,0.999124343257443,91.0,476.0

That is how most nongovernmental privileges and trade secret laws already work. One must show a reasonable expectation of confidentiality to claim the attorney-client, spousal, clergy-penitent, or psychotherapist-patient privilege.

michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Economics literature helps to explain the significance of such costs. According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",body_text,text,0.9484612532443456,112.0,567.0
michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Concededly, officers engaged in knowing fraud or misconduct present the most challenging case because these individuals will find ex ante secrecy so valuable. Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals' incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their postdispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article's reform proposal will offer no benefit.",body_text,text,0.9963689179375453,113.0,568.0

On the contrary, the vagueness of current doctrine is judge-made and arguably reflects a variety of institutional incentives shared by many members of the judiciary. As Ana Lvovsky has articulated especially well, judges' motives for deferring to law enforcement are numerous and can include political pressures; personal ideological sympathies; pragmatic sensitivity to the challenges of policing; a desire to manage caseloads by simplifying or avoiding otherwise 'sticky legal issues'; a preference for disposing of issues through 'procedural lenience' towards the police rather than potentially 'controversial or corrosive substantive holdings'; and a pull to",body_text,text,0.8031573754316724,114.0,570.0

Judges have a mix of institutional incentives, including pressures to protect the interests of criminal defendants. 361 Secrecy concerning law enforcement investigative techniques does not entirely eliminate docket-clogging motions or thorny legal and constitutional issues. Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy. Even if investigative methods are disclosed under a strict protective order, the judge's conclusions as to their lawfulness and reliability need not be.

Vagueness in the doctrine provides cover for deference. Deference, in turn, enables judges to avoid uncomfortable and time-consuming decisions. By maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes.

michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"More generally, this Article's analysis suggests a new 'circumstantial evidence' theory of confidentiality's role in privilege law as a whole, with potentially radical implications for government privilege writ large. Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties-such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges-require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that 'originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.' 369 That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist. 370",body_text,text,0.8064250411861614,123.0,594.0
michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege,"Instead, the Article argued that courts should evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. To do this, judges should assess how law enforcement itself previously treated the purportedly privileged information. If the safeguards available through a court-ordered protective order could match or exceed law enforcement's own prior confidentiality requirements, courts should default to ordering disclosure. This approach has substantive, institutional, procedural, and normative advantages.

The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information.

The Offset Provision cases produced two general categories of sovereign injuries, styled here as the 'Spending Contract' injury and the 'Tax Power' injury. The Spending Contract injury, the asserted basis for standing in the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, 20 focuses on the offer : Congress offends state sovereignty when it offers federal funds with coercive or ambiguous spending conditions. 21 The Tax Power injury-a 'plus factor' for standing in the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits-focuses on the subject matter : States can challenge congressional exercises of the Spending Clause that constrain certain sovereign prerogatives, like the power to tax. 22",body_text,text,0.7875457875457875,10.0,53.0
michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing,"Although it is true that states suffer some form of sovereign injury when Congress exceeds its spending power, most of the Offset Provision decisions are simply too broad. An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something-anything-'sovereign' enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on 'dubious' and 'lawless' standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them. Because Congress often relies on its spending power for modern legislation, 24 an expansive 'welcome' mat into federal court risks further turning the judiciary into the arbiter of policy battles. 25",body_text,text,0.84472049689441,11.0,55.0

Indeed, those courts also held mostly for the state plaintiffs on the merits. Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes-in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a 'sovereign' policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",body_text,text,0.9857493857493858,49.0,250.0

To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a 'social currency' that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injurycausing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",body_text,text,0.9867474441499432,12.0,45.0

The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury.

michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources,"As previously discussed, compensatory resources are also scarce because defendants often do not have enough money to satisfy their tort judgments. Under the early common law, a judgment that rendered the defendant insolvent was not simply a financial matter. The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment. 13 Debtor's prison-a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century 14 -supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability.

'Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.' Id.

michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources,"Although this compensatory form of strict liability now has limited application, it has an important implication for the normative properties of tort law. A purely compensatory tort rule, by definition, is wholly justified in terms of fair or reasonable injury compensation and not by injury deterrence (unlike negligence and related rules of strict liability formulated to overcome the evidentiary hurdles of proving negligence liability). A purely compensatory tort rule is allocatively inefficient: The compensatory transfer merely shifts the injury costs from one party to the other while creating the associated transaction costs. In the absence of deterrence, social costs are minimized by letting the loss fall on the injured accident victim. How, then, can a compensatory rule of strict liability be squared with the normative calculus of tort law defined in terms of both welfarist and nonwelfarist rationales for tort liability?",body_text,text,1.0,167.0,429.0

In the same way that deterrence can justifiably shape tort law even if tort liability does not optimally deter, the ideal of full compensation embodied in the Pareto principle can justifiably shape tort law under second-best conditions of imperfect injury compensation. See generally Mark A. Geistfeld, Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts: Carrying Calabresi Further , J.L. & CONTEMP. PROBS., no. 2, 2014, at 165 (showing how a compensatory norm generates tort rules that adequately satisfy the demands of the Pareto principle for social interactions constrained by transaction costs). As for the central normative importance of the Pareto principle for welfarist interpretations of tort law, see LOUIS KAPLOW & STEVEN SHAVELL, FAIRNESS VERSUS WELFARE 54-56, 54 n.76 (2002) for an argument that any nonwelfarist rationale for tort law violates the Pareto principle and should be rejected for that reason.",footnote,footnote,0.9262926292629263,165.0,432.0
michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources,"In yet one more respect, then, the problem of scarce compensatory resources alters the normative calculus of tort law in a predictable way that conventional tort theories have not recognized. Like duty-bearers, right-holders do not have unlimited compensatory resources and accordingly have a reasonable interest in minimizing their injury compensation costs. For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder's total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrencebased liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",body_text,text,0.9985948477751756,169.0,434.0

For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 387, 394-96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder's willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.",footnote,footnote,0.9790393013100437,166.0,437.0

This Article takes no position on whether the hyperneutrality of the contemporary congressional bureaucracy is normatively justifiable in a time of hyperpartisanship. The midcentury occupants of the congressional OLCs pushed beyond the Columbia Triumvirate's nonpartisanship to embrace neutrality on questions of congressional power. In this, the congressional OLCs set a precedent for other components of the congressional bureaucracy-for example, CRS-that have been stymied by a kind of hyperneutrality that demands that congressional bureaucrats avoid answering consequential questions entirely.

yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War,"abstract. Each day, the news brings stories of military attacks on schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, electrical facilities, and other critical civilian infrastructure. The militaries attacking these objects often seek to justify the attacks by claiming that the civilian objects are being used by militants. Objects that are believed to have both military and civilian use are often referred to as 'dual-use' objects. Even though the term has become common, international law does not recognize a 'dual-use' object as a legally meaningful category. Rather, the postwar Geneva Conventions that lie at the core of modern international humanitarian law establish a bright line between 'military objectives' that are considered legitimate targets of military force, and civilians and 'civilian objects, ' which are to be strictly protected.",body_text,text,0.9899109792284867,0.0,3.0
yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War,"Weshow in this Article that the targeting of dual-use objects over the last several decades has blurred this line, placing civilians at great risk. The United States has played a critical role in the increasingly expansive targeting of dual-use objects. Indeed, most accounts of the origins of dualuse targeting start with the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led coalition responded to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait with airstrikes on Iraq's electrical infrastructure and bridges. The Article reviews the history of dual-use targeting and presents an original dataset and primary-source evidence from the sites of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2018 to illustrate the wide range of dual-use objects that the U.S. military has struck. It draws on ground reporting and research to show the true costs of this dual-use targeting for civilians living in areas of conflict. The United States is far from alone in targeting dual-use objects, but we focus on it because it shapes the law of armed conflict by projecting force around the world, providing legal justifications for its use of force, and setting the standards by which other states are measured. Finally, this Article recommends that states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects so that they can make better-informed targeting decisions. We also offer several recommendations for clarifying international humanitarian law to prevent further erosion of the protections the law provides to civilians during war.",body_text,text,0.9980327868852459,1.0,4.0

The United States deployed the concept in the context of air warfare during the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led coalition's response to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait included airstrikes on Iraq's electrical infrastructure and bridges. 25 The practice became widespread in the decades following the 9/11 attacks, as the United States waged war against nonstate armed groups, the members of which are often embedded in and difficult to distinguish from the civilian population. 26 The difficulty of distinguishing between combatants and civilians and between military objectives and civilian objects is especially pronounced in conflicts involving nonstate armed groups that capture territory and attempt to govern civilian populations, including conflicts involving al-Qaeda and ISIS. 27",body_text,text,0.7888611803823774,9.0,56.0

We thus recommendthat states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects that are critical to civilian well-being in areas of conflict so that they can anticipate, and take steps to mitigate, the impact of their targeting decisions on civilians.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"abstract. For incarcerated people litigating pro se, the civil discovery process is vitally important. When imprisoned litigants lack meaningful access to discovery, their cases become swearing contests they are bound to lose, and wrongdoing in prison goes unaddressed. Yet for these same plaintiffs, civil discovery is defunct. The vast majority of incarcerated plaintiffs, including those with promising or meritorious claims, are unable to navigate either to or through litigation's discovery phase. Part diagnosis and part treatment, this Article is the first to explore in depth how the discovery process fails those pursuing civil-rights claims against their jailers, revealing both a crisis in prison litigation and a failure of our procedural regime.",body_text,text,0.9986807387862797,0.0,3.0

This research reveals differences between the districts' case-management decisions and cultures, resulting in startling disparities in prison litigants' discovery prospects. Incarcerated litigants' current chances of evidencing and vindicating claims may be largely contingent on the district in which their prison sits-what some incarcerated people call 'justice by jurisdiction.

It then discusses the much broader amalgam of practical impediments to evidence gathering in prison.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"Part I explores the written rules governing prison litigation, including the scant few bearing on discovery. It begins by surveying the impoverished legal options available to those who wish to resist the harsh conditions of their confinement in federal court. The barriers are twofold: many of prison's indignities simply lie outside the scope of federal causes of action, and for those few who can locate a cognizable claim, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)-a 1996 law aimed at stemming frivolous prison litigation-makes its vindication nearly impossible, imposing procedural hurdles at litigation's earliest phases. 58 Most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims thus fail before discovery even begins. For the few cases that emerge, effective discovery is of vital importance: having survived the PLRA's hurdles, these are the cases that everyone agrees could well be nonfrivolous-ample reason they be properly evidenced and heard. For these cases, discovery promises fairness, exposure, and regulation sorely needed in the carceral context.

yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis,"Part II turns to the unwritten rules that cement discovery's failures for those plaintiffs who do access the process, relying on case research and dozens of interviews with formerly incarcerated people, federal magistrate and district judges, staff attorneys, civil-rights lawyers, and prison officials. 59 This Part begins by outlining the predictable evidentiary needs undergirding most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims. These needs are not inherently harder to fulfill in the prison context; the problem instead lies in the practical constraints hindering the process. Security concerns make a significant share of relevant evidence simply undiscoverable. And since prisons control the creation and storage of most evidence-surveillance footage, written incident reports, and the likenegligence or ill will can mean the disappearance of (or the failure ever to produce) vital information. Resource restrictions make valuable discovery tools like depositions and expert reports inaccessible to imprisoned litigants, shutting off any real hope of poking holes in a defendant's story or proving a doctor's indifference to a medical condition. And hostility between incarcerated people and their jailers breeds distrust, foot-dragging, and credible allegations of spoliation. Together, these difficulties are different in both degree and kind from those faced by other pro se litigants and civil-rights plaintiffs. The Article thus draws the unavoidable conclusion that the aspirationally transsubstantive Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wholly disserve prison litigation. Without unique intervention, no meaningful opportunity exists for incarcerated plaintiffs to evidence their claims. Through this lens, the Article contributes to ongoing efforts to distinguish law in theory from law in practice 60 and joins a mounting chorus of",body_text,text,0.9733475479744137,33.0,151.0

First, courts should, where resources permit, be far more open to recruiting counsel for imprisoned plaintiffs embarking upon discovery. Second, courts should standardize the discovery process in prison litigation, creating certain tailored discovery rules for imprisoned litigants' claims. Third, judges should intervene through telephonic status conferences to advise plaintiffs on the process and ensure that they are not floundering or getting the runaround. Fourth, courts should take creative approaches to widening the availability of discovery tools, including making use of new technology to broaden incarcerated litigants' access to oral depositions. And finally, there should be efforts both in and out of court to police the creation, storage, and disclosure of evidence. This includes spoliation sanctions or curative measures when prisons overwrite surveillance footage after someone has filed a grievance implicating that footage. It also means devising standardized protocols for flagging evidence that poses security risks, along with safe procedures to handle that evidence's production and use.
