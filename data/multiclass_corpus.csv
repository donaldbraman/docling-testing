In the absence of a compensatory remedy for fatal harms, their prevention must be the decisive reason for including them in the duty.

"This Article presents evidence that some state  prosecutors  use their  discretion to  reduce racial  disparities  in criminal  sentences.  This finding challenges the prevailing  view  that  prosecutors  compound disparities.  Given prosecutors'positions as mediators  in a sequential  system,  this Article analyzes how prosecutors  respond  to disparities  they  inherit  from  the past-and  interprets their impacts in light of the accumulated  disparities  that  already  exist when they first  open their  case  files.  Specifically,  I estimate how  the sentencing penalty  for prior  convictions differs by  defendant race  using  North  Carolina  state  court  records  from 2010 to 2019. I  find that the increase  in the likelihood of a  prison  sentence for  an additional  prior  conviction was 25% higher  for white than  Black defendants with similar  arrests  and  criminal records. While Black and  white defendants without criminal  records were incarcerated at similar rates, white defendants with records were incarcerated  at significantly higher rates.

"Justices Kennedy and Scalia would continue to debate background principles' source of law in a series of cases. In the next case involving background principles, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island , 62 the Court confronted the question of whether a state statute can act as a background limitation on private property that changes hands after the statute's enactment. 63 In the process of answering that question, Justice Kennedy argued that Lucas grounded background principles in the 'common, shared understandings of permissible limitations derived from a State's legal tradition.' 64 Concurring, Justice Scalia suggested that statutes are only relevant to the background principles analysis insofar as they reflect the state's common law of 'property and nuisance.' 65",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"The common-law approach would be irrational, as Pollock claimed, if the absence of a damages remedy means that the common law is simply not concerned about premature death. An obvious rejoinder is that the criminal law provides the requisite protection. This response is not fully persuasive, however. Individuals often fatally injure someone else without engaging in criminal misconduct, as frequently occurs in motor-vehicle crashes. 103 Criminal liability does not attach to all accidents causing premature death, and in these cases, tort law does not compensate decedents for their loss of life's pleasures. Wereturn, then, to Pollock's claim that there is no 'plausible ground' for this feature of the common law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Is the  professional ethos of  public prosecutors different from  that of  other  lawyers? If so,  to  what extent are  public  prosecutors therefore obligated to  conduct  themselves  differently from other lawyers?  There  are  no  universally accepted answers  to  these questions. Even though  lawyers  have  undertaken the  task of  representing  public entities in  the  prosecution of  criminal charges  for many years, the  ethical implications of  this task  remain  contested. Now familiar, and  well  over  a  decade  old, are  the  battles over  how prosecutors  exercise  their investigative authority -in particular, whether  ethical rules should  restrain prosecutors when they  seek  to issue grand  jury subpoenas  to  criminal defense  lawyers 3  or  when they seek  to  question defendants and  other represented persons, or permit  investigators to  do so,  without the  knowledge and  permission  of  the  person's lawyer. 4",cover,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf

The Biden Administration's approach had three primary elements: (1) broad publicity, 87 (2) listening sessions, town hall meetings, and tribal consultations, and (3) ongoing engagement during implementation. 88 The first of these prongs, broad publicity, 'used a variety of approaches to raise awareness and encourage input,' 89 reaching a far broader audience than a publication of notice in the Federal Register. The Biden White House and its executive agencies took a modern approach to publicity, using social media posts and websites dedicated to the review of specific rules and regulations alongside direct stakeholder outreach. 90 Critically, this direct outreach, to be implemented in place of notice and comment, should cover a wide swath of relevant interests, reaching community members outside traditional business interests who might be impacted by the rule under consideration.

"Tobesure, critics have challenged whether the empirical premises behind the policy rationale hold up at all. 191 Perhaps transparency of methods would deter crimes instead of enabling them, or have little effect. 192 Perhaps secrecy only matters at the margins for highly sophisticated criminal actors. 193 After all, many people commit crimes without adopting countermeasures as obvious as wearing gloves to conceal fingerprints. 194 On the other hand, it is unclear how many more people commit crimes wearing gloves than would if fingerprinting were a secret technique. In the absence of empirical evidence that publicity would or would not aid countermeasures, which is exceedingly hard to obtain, 195 plausible arguments exist on both sides of the issue. The uncertainty affords law enforcement a reliable basis from which to argue that disclosure could undermine an extremely broad sweep of investigative methods.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Second,  the Article argues that  police  prosecutions  hamper large-scale changes to policing. By allowing  law enforcement to claim that brutality  is an aberration, solvable through use  of the  very  system  that encourages brutality  in the  first  place, we re-inscribe  the  failures  of  policing  and  ignore the  everyday systemic and destructive violence perpetrated  by police on communities of color.  In  order to  achieve racial  justice and real  police reform, we  must reduce our reliance on the police, rather than looking to the criminal  legal  system to solve this crisis.",cover,Levine - 2020 - Police Prosecutions and Punitive Instincts.pdf

"Although anyone would understandably be upset by such unreasonable misconduct, no one is directly threatened with bodily injury when a corpse is mishandled or a telegram is not properly transcribed. The absence of any foreseeable physical harms within the duty eliminates the equitable concern about limiting the duty so that the 'worst go first,' justifying an expansion of the duty to encompass these emotional harms. These limited exceptions permitting recovery for stand-alone emotional distress confirm that the physical-harm requirement in other cases bars such recovery to increase the amount of scarce resources for compensating physically harmed right-holders.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The congressional OLCs' system also helps us better understand the nature of legislative constitutionalism within Congress. If legislative constitutionalism were just politics by another name, 40 then this category of opinions would be pointless. Lawmakers' eager consumption of the Offices' views of the law, marketed as legal products distinct from briefs, shows that lawmakers had a genuine interest in vindicating their constitutional oaths. This point is further illustrated by this Article's empirical findings, which show that the opinions-drafting practice was especially powerful among a cadre of bipartisan lawmakers who made constitutionalism a key part of their legislative politics. 41 This is the grouping of lawmakers in both chambers who communicate to their constituents and to their colleagues with a heavy emphasis on constitutional norms and ideas.",body_text,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

"The Conclusion gestures at future avenues of research with a focus on institutional developments within Congress. Because of the vast scope of the materials unearthed (including materials beyond the opinions-drafting practice), this Article sets the table for a multi-article agenda that will be published over several years. One article in this series will focus on the opinions-drafting practice's implications for our conception of legislative constitutionalism. A second article will show that the Columbia Triumvirate's techniques revolutionized Congress's statute drafting and made the statutory state possible. This second article will deal with related doctrinal questions, such as whether the congressional OLCs made textualism and purposivism possible by making Congress's statutes professional and legible. Finally, a third article will place the Columbia Triumvirate in a jurisprudential lineage that complicates our understanding of twentiethcentury legal schools of thought.",body_text,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

"Though irrelevant for proving negligent misconduct or the amount of compensable harm, the availability of liability insurance is relevant to the antecedent element of duty. Unlike the case-specific inquiries concerning unreasonable behavior and compensatory damages, the element of duty entails a categorical inquiry that accounts for the burden the tort obligation would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the cases the duty governs. 190 The nature of this inquiry provides a principled basis for making the availability of liability insurance relevant to the tort duty-the only aspect of the tort claim for which courts expressly rely on liability insurance to formulate substantive tort doctrine. 191",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"By creating a form of injury compensation normatively different from blood money, liability insurance alters the social meaning of monetary damages, thereby implicating tort law theories that make liability dependent on culpability. For example, John Goldberg and Benjamin Zipursky argue that 'the point of tort law is to define and prohibit certain forms of mistreatment, and to provide victims of such mistreatment with the ability to use civil litigation to obtain redress from those who have mistreated them.' 199 In their view, the purely compensatory rule of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities does not involve any such mistreatment, making this form of liability 'so distinctive as to locate it at or beyond tort law's conceptual boundaries.' 200 However, liability insurance and a host of other developments render implausible the claim that tort liability is necessarily limited to redress for mistreatment.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Once again, compensatory resource scarcity elucidates an important normative property of tort law. '[T]he legal culture lacks a full normative account of the relationship between retributive goals and punitive damages.' 153 The defendant's bad-faith rejection of the primary obligation to exercise reasonable care, even when coupled with the payment of compensatory damages for the breach, is reprehensible only because the compensatory damages remedy does not adequately protect the tort right in cases of irreparable injury. This inherent limitation of the compensatory damages remedy stems from the scarcity of compensatory resources and creates a retributive rationale for punitive damages-a property consistent with our earlier finding that perfectly compensatory damages obviate the need to punish injury-causing conduct. 154",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"both the term ""Rep term ""Democrat"" w sinister meaning to radical tendencies that were ""subversive"" of the order of things then dominant. In the enforcement of laws which protect our national integrity and existence, we should prosecute any and every act of violation, but only overt acts, not the expression of opinion, or activities such as the holding of meetings, petitioning of Congress, or dissemination of news or opinions. Only by extreme care can we protect the spirit as well as the letter of our civil liberties, and to do so is a responsibility of the federal prosecutor. entirely. The same variation of attitudes towards other law-enforcement problems exists. The federal government could not enforce one kind of law in one place and another kind elsewhere. It could hardly adopt strict standards for loose states or loose standards for strict states without doing violence to local sentiment. In spite of the temptation to divert our power to local conditions where they have become offensive to our sense of decency, the only long-term policy that will save federal justice from being discredited by entanglements with local politics is that it confine itself to strict and impartial enforcement of federal law, letting the chips fall in the community where they may. Just as there should be no permitting of local considerations to stop federal enforcement, so there should be no striving to enlarge our power over local affairs and no use of federal prosecutions to exert an indirect influence that would be unlawful if exerted directly.",cover,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf

"A few years later, Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Cedar Point majority, applied a general law approach. 95 To justify Cedar Point 's expansive rule that any physical invasion effectuated through a regulation constitutes a taking, Chief Justice Roberts first concluded that 'property' entails the absolute 'right to exclude,' 96 which 'cannot be balanced away.' 97 Because 'the right to exclude is 'universally held to be a fundamental element of the property right,'' 98 a regulation burdening this right categorically creates a Fifth Amendment taking. 99 The Court's exaltation of the right to exclude, and its subsequent holding that the California access regulation was a taking, rested on Blackstone's Commentaries , a law review article, and Supreme Court precedents. 100 In fact, the Court effectively prioritized general law over state law. As Professor Maureen Brady observes, 'the Court used a selective general-law approach to elide the question whether the longstanding California access regulation should constitute a background principle limiting agricultural owners' title.' 101",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"A  large  percentage of  criminal prosecutions begin  with  the arrest of  the  individual without a warrant by some law  enforcement officer during  the investigation. The other  great  bulk of  criminal cases  begin  on the  complaint  of the  victim  or  a police officer and warrant  issued  thereon. The prosecutor has little control over  the  processing of the criminal case which begins  with  an arrest by the  law enforcement officer. He  may refuse to approve,  either by direct right of the  statute or by the  indirect pressure, to  countenance a complaint  by the  magistrate. In  the  latter case the  magistrate will  usually go along with  whatever  the  prosecutor wants,  whether  there be statutory authority or  not. However, in  some states, the  prosecutor does not first approve or necessarily even know  that a complaint is  being  issued and is  called in  after the  fact.'

"The  idea of  allocating criminal punishment through what  looks like a  street bazaar  has  proved  unappealing to  most  outside observers. Critics point to  the seeming  hypocrisy of using an  elaborate trial process as  window dressing, while doing  all the  real business of  the system  through the  most  unelaborate process imaginable. 9 They emphasize  the  unfairness (and  inaccuracy) of  determining defendants' fate without full investigation, without testimony and  evidence and impartial factfinding; they emphasize  too how this unfairness disproportionately harms the poor  and  unsophisticated. 0  Perhaps  especially, they  note  the  seeming  pervasiveness of  coercion and fraud  in  the  system.  Defendants  accept bargains because  of the threat of much harsher penalties after trial; they  are thus forced  to  give  up the  protections that the  trial system's many  formalities provide.""  And  judges  ofterx give  bargained-for sentences because  of  what prosecutors and defense  lawyers  do not say  at  sentencing; the  sentencing hearing seems rigged to  support the  deal  that the  two attorneys have  already struck. 1 2",cover,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf

From 1919 to 1969, the two Offices of the Legislative Counsel-one in the Senate and one in the House of Representatives-developed a system for resolving lawmakers' constitutional questions using a hierarchy of precedential opinions, nonprecedential memoranda, and briefs. When these Offices constructed constitutional meaning, they put a thumb on the scale for congressional power with a novel reasonable-doubt standard designed to vindicate Article I power. Lawyers in Congress used these opinions to construct constitutional meaning, establish drafting conventions, flesh out Congress's role in the administrative state, and build up Congress's hard and soft powers.",body_text,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism
"Progressive prosecutors have been widely hailed as the solution to mass incarceration.  This Article argues,  to the contrary,  that the legal  arm of law  enforcement  can  never be the  full answer  to its problems. While  scholars  critique police  and call  to  defund  and  dismantle  them, they  overlook prosecutors. Building  on the work  of abolitionist organizers  to theorize  and critique  progressive prosecutors,  the  Article asks  two  key questions  that  scholars  have  left  unanswered:  1)  Should the  system be  changed  from within?  and 2)  Can  the system  be  changed  from within? In  other words,  can reformers prosecute,  and can prosecutors  transform? I  answer the first question with cautious  optimism, concluding  that  prosecutors' institutional  power  and ethical mandate  to  ""do justice"" can be repurposed to start reversing decades  of  building  the carceral  state.  As to whether prosecutors  can  transform  the  system,  I  conclude  they  cannot. Transformation  entails  ceding power  to communities,  divesting  criminal  system resources,  and  investing  in  societal  supports that  actually  keep people  safe. Prosecutors'  essential  function  to  convict  and  punish  people cannot meaningfully  achieve  the dismantling of the carceral  state or the buildup  of alternatives.

"My aim in this Article is to isolate one important design margin for  evaluating  algorithmic  criminal  justice:  the  effect  of  algorithmic criminal  justice  tools  on racial  equity .  I  use  this  capacious  term  to capture the complex ways in which the state's use of a technology can implicate normative and legal concerns related to racial dynamics. The Article  considers  a  number  of  ways  in  which  legal  scholars  and computer scientists have theorized how criminal justice interacts with racial  patterning  in  practice.  It  analyzes  the  utility  of  each  lens  for evaluating new algorithmic technologies. A primary lesson concerns the parameter  that best captures racial equity concerns in an algorithmic  setting:  I  suggest  that  the  leading  metrics  advanced  by computer scientists are not sufficient, and propose an alternative. A secondary  lesson  relates  to  the  fit  between  problems  of  race  in  the algorithmic context on the one hand, and legal or technical conceptions of equality on the other. Reflection on technological change, that is, casts light on the approaching desuetude of equal protection doctrine.",cover,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf

"state's authority. The fiduciary theory can illuminate the scope of these constraints. With the fiduciary theory's clarification, the investor can better understand-and reasonably expect-what the state can, and more importantly, cannot contract away through an IIA. At its core, the fiduciary theory is about the nature of a state's sovereignty. Sovereignty is not a blank check to exercise illimitable power. Instead, it is collective power bestowed by that state's citizenry to ensure they can exercise inalienable rights. Consequently, contracting away the power to regulate in protection of a population's human rights through an IIA is clearly outside the bounds of a state's valid exercise of sovereignty. 134",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"not recognize a formal category of 'dual-use' objects. 21 Indeed, a critical innovation of the postwar Geneva Conventions, which lie at the core of modern international humanitarian law, was to establish a bright line separating 'military objectives, ' which were deemed legitimate targets of military force, from civilians and 'civilian objects, ' which were to be strictly protected. 22 That bright-line distinction meant new and important protections for civilians in war.

Based on previous spending cases, Professor Stephen Vladeck argues that the Spending Clause furnishes states with standing to challenge coercive spending conditions. 162 Based on the foregoing discussion of the judicial constraints on the congressional spending power and the states' role in administering federal policy, states clearly are constitutionally entitled to some standing to challenge truly coercive or ambiguous spending conditions.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Federal  prosecutors  control the  terms  of confinement in  this  vast  penal system  because  they  have  the  authority  to  make  charging decisions, enter cooperation agreements,  accept pleas,  and recommend  sentences.  In the current era  dominated  by pleas  instead of trials, federal  prosecutors  are  not  merely law enforcers.  They  are  the  final  adjudicators  in  the  vast  majority  of cases. It  is only in  the  rare 5% of federal cases that  go  to  trial  that  an  independent  actor reviews prosecutorial  decisions.6  In the 95% of cases that are not  tried before  a federal  judge  or jury,  there  are  currently  no  effective  legal  checks  in  place  to police the  manner  in  which prosecutors exercise their discretion to  bring charges, to  negotiate pleas, or  to set  their  office policies. 7 In a  national government  whose hallmark is  supposed to be the separation  of powers,  federal prosecutors  are  a  glaring  and  dangerous  exception. 8 They have  the authority  to take away liberty, yet they are  often the final judges  in their own cases. 9",cover,Barkow - 2008 - Institutional Design and the Policing of Prosecutors Lessons from Administrative Law.pdf

"to have (almost) the same range of options' they had prior to the injury. The damages remedy for these irreparable harms cannot 'make it as if the wrong had never happened.' Rather than rely on the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy, tort law strives to prevent these irreparable injuries by incorporating their social values into the obligation to exercise reasonable carecontrary to Weinrib's claim that 'deterrence plays no role in defining the nature of the wrong.' The inadequacy of compensatory damages makes deterrence especially valuable. Deterrence is an essential property for understanding tort law that is overlooked by formulations of corrective justice which assume that compensatory damages can always normatively correct for wrongdoing and fully restore normative equilibrium.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Wealth would seem to be substantively irrelevant given the rule that excludes evidence concerning the defendant's financial resources when determining breach or compensatory damages. The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor's prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law-why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

We thus recommendthat states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects that are critical to civilian well-being in areas of conflict so that they can anticipate, and take steps to mitigate, the impact of their targeting decisions on civilians. We also offer several recommendations for clarifying international humanitarian law to account more effectively for-and thus more effectively prevent-the grave harm that targeting dual-use objects inflicts on civilians during war, with effects that can be felt for generations.",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War

"45 . In recent years, scholars have often used the term 'prisoner' to refer to people who are presently incarcerated. See, e.g. , Justin Driver & Emma Kaufman, The Incoherence of Prison Law , 135 Harv. L. Rev. 515, 525 (2021); Sharon Dolovich, The Coherence of Prison Law , 135 Harv. L. Rev . F. 301, 302 n.2 (2022).

"These numbers are especially alarming considering that developing countries serve as respondents in almost 80% of investor-state arbitrations. 47 At first, this seems logical. After all, are these not the countries predominantly seeking foreign investment? But the data shows that investors disproportionately levy claims against these countries relative to the foreign investment the countries attract. Latin American countries received 9.3% of global FDI in 2022, yet they were subject to 27.5% of all investor claims. 48 In the same year, African countries received 5.4% of FDI but were respondents in 16.2% of all claims. 49 Not only are these countries disproportionately sued, but they also have lower rates of success in proceedings: Developed countries won 53.6% of all cases lodged against them, while developing countries won a mere 33.3% of claims. 50",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"More generally, this Article's analysis suggests a new 'circumstantial evidence' theory of confidentiality's role in privilege law as a whole, with potentially radical implications for government privilege writ large. Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties-such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges-require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that 'originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.' 369 That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist. 370",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"One way of thinking  about  what level  of crime  risk justifies  restraint  is  to ask whether  the answer is different for defendants than for anyone else. It is generally assumed  that defendants are a special  case,  exempt by virtue of pending charges  from otherwise applicable protections  against preventive  interference.  This Article  challenges  that assumption.  It argues  that,  for purposes  of restraint  for  general  dangerousness,  there  is no clear  constitutional,  moral,  or practical  basis  for distinguishing defendants  from non-defendants  who are equally dangerous. There is thus no basis to conclude  that the risk standard  for such restraint  should  be different  for defendants  than  for anyone else.",cover,Mayson - 2017 - Dangerous Defendants.pdf

"Abstract. This  Essay  argues  that  racial  reckoning  in  policing  should  include  a  racial reckoning  in the use of criminal records. Arrests alone-regardless  of  whether they result in  convictions-create  criminal  records.  Yet  because  the  literature on  criminal  records most  often focuses on  prisoner reentry and  on the consequences  of criminal  conviction, it is easy  to overlook the connections between policing decisions and collateral consequences.  This Essay  employs the  sociological  framework  of marking to show how criminal records  entrench  racial inequality  stemming  from  policing. The  marking framework  recognizes  that the government  creates  a  negative  credential  every  time it creates  a  record  of arrest  as  well  as  conviction.  Such  records,  in  turn,  trigger  cascading consequences  for  employment,  housing,  immigration,  and  a  host  of  other  areas.  The credentialing  process  matters because  it  enables and  conceals  race-based  discrimination, and  because  a  focus  on the  formal  sentence  often  renders  this discrimination  invisible. This  Essay  considers  how  adopting a  credentialing  framework  offers a  way to surface, and  ultimately to address,  how  race-based policing  leaves lasting marks  on over-policed communities.",cover,PLX42UF4_Jain_Mark_of_Policing.pdf
"Commentators  traditionally viewed the absence of concrete rules governing prosecutorial  discretion as a blight on the criminal justice landscape, contributing to overly punitive and often racist criminal  justice outcomes. 7 Yet in recent years, with  the  ascension  of unapologetically  ""progressive  prosecutors,""  commentary on  prosecutorial  power  developed  a  new  dimension. 8 In  2017,  for  example, newly  elected Orlando District Attorney Aramis Ayala announced that her office would  no  longer  seek  the  death  penalty.'  Over  one  hundred  prominent  law professors and  public  officials signed  an open  letter  of  support. Efforts  to override Ayala's decision, they wrote, threatened prosecutors' ""extremely  broad discretion  to  decide  when,  and  how,  to  prosecute""  and  ""compromise[d] the prosecutorial  independence  upon which the criminal justice system  depends."" 0 Around the same time,  Baltimore's chief  prosecutor,  Marilyn Mosby, became  a ""proxy for a nation reeling  with outrage and disbelief' when she swiftly  initiated ultimately  unsuccessful  criminal  charges  against  six police  officers  involved  in the  death  of Freddie  Gray.""  In  a  ""clip that  would  echo  across  the  country,"" Mosby  explained  to  supporters,  ""I have  heard  your  calls  for  'no  justice,  no",cover,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf

"How can a better balance be struck? This Article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: The policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. The Article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

The court then cited opinions from 'across the country' in which other courts had 'rejected recovery for purely economic losses stemming from manmade calamity' based on concerns 'about line-drawing problems and potentially overwhelming liability.' 252 Relying on these cases and explaining why these same concerns applied to the case at hand-a months-long massive leakage of natural gas in a suburb outside Los Angeles-the court dismissed the claims of several small businesses in the area seeking recovery for their lost profits not proximately caused by any damage to their real or tangible property. 253,body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"This Note considers existing issues with public participation in the informal rulemaking process and proposes a solution that combines the statutory good cause exception with the functional implementation of public engagement methods inspired by the Biden Administration. Part I provides an overview of the existing tools for public participation in the rulemaking process, namely notice and comment; the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); and off-the-record consultation between senior agency officials and their industry contacts, what this Note refers to as 'Rolodex Rulemaking.' Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders' involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

Dilworth, 147 N.E.3d 445 (Mass. 2020) (denying law enforcement privilege claim for information about undercover Snapchat accounts, which a criminal defendant sought for purposes of proving a claim of racially biased selective enforcement in violation of the equal protection standard). As another example, biometric surveillance software such as face recognition can have disparate accuracy rates based on race, gender, and age. E.g. , Joy Buolamwini & Timnit Gebru, Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification , 81 PROC. MACH. LEARNING RSCH. 77 (2018). Machine learning software trained with carceral data sources can reproduce the biases built into past carceral practices. Ngozi Okidegbe, Discredited Data , 107 CORNELL L. REV. 2007 (2022). But see Bennett Capers, Race, Policing, and Technology , 95 N.C. L. REV. 1241, 1271-77 (2017). At the same time, even if surveillance software does not rely on racially biased algorithms, police may deploy the software to disproportionately surveil racial minorities and other historically marginalized groups. Indeed, the United States has a long history of law enforcement surveillance disproportionately deployed against racial minorities. See generally , Aziz Z.

"This  Essay employs  the sociological concept  of marking to recognize  how policing  decisions entrench racial  inequality. 4  A marking framework treats an arrest  or  conviction as  a  form  of  public  credentialing. The  credentialing process  matters  because  it  translates  a  particular  experience  into  a  formally recognized status.  For  example, an  individual  could  receive  a  world-class education  through  her  public  library,  but without  the  credential  of a  degree, she  would  struggle  to  formalize  that  knowledge  and  demonstrate  its  value. Similarly, a  criminal  record  formalizes  the  experience  of  being  arrested.  It translates  a  single  police  officer's  decision  to  arrest  into  a  marker  that  has lasting social meaning.",cover,PLX42UF4_Jain_Mark_of_Policing.pdf

"This  Article  introduces  to  legal  scholarship  the  first  sustained  discussion  of  prison abolition and what I will call a ""prison abolitionist  ethic.""  Prisons and punitive policing produce  tremendous brutality, violence, racial stratification,  ideological  rigidity, despair, and waste. Meanwhile,  incarceration  and  prison-backed  policing neither  redress  nor repair  the  very  sorts  of harms  they  are  supposed  to  address-interpersonal  violence, addiction,  mental  illness,  and  sexual  abuse,  among  others. Yet despite  persistent  and increasing  recognition  of the deep problems  that attend  U.S. incarceration  and prisonbacked  policing, criminal  law  scholarship  has  largely failed  to  consider  how the  goals of criminal  law-principally  deterrence,  incapacitation,  rehabilitation,  and  retributive justice-might  be  pursued  by  means  entirely  apart  from  criminal  law  enforcement. Abandoning prison-backed punishment  and punitive policing remains generally unfathomable. This  Article  argues  that the  general  reluctance  to engage  seriously  an abolitionist framework represents  a failure  of  moral, legal, and political  imagination. If abolition  is understood to entail simply the  immediate  tearing down  of  all prison walls, then it is  easy to  dismiss  abolition  as  unthinkable. But  if  abolition  consists  instead  of an aspirational  ethic  and a  framework of  gradual decarceration,  which entails a positive substitution  of other  regulatory  forms  for  criminal  regulation,  then  the  inattention  to abolition in criminal law scholarship  and reformist discourse  comes into focus as a more troubling  absence.  Although violent  crime prevention  and proportional punishment of wrongdoing purportedly justify imprisonment, this Article illuminates  how the ends of criminal  law  might  be  accomplished  in  large  measure  through institutions  aside  from criminal law administration.  More specifically, this Article explores  a form  of  grounded preventive  justice neglected  in  existing  scholarly, legal, and  policy accounts.  Grounded preventive justice offers  a positive  substitutive  account of abolition  that aims to displace criminal  law  enforcement  through  meaningful justice  reinvestment  to  strengthen  the social arm of the state and improve human welfare. This positive  substitutive  abolitionist framework would operate  by expanding social  projects to  prevent the need  for carceral responses,  decriminalizing  less  serious  infractions,  improving  the design  of spaces  and products  to  reduce  opportunities for  offending,  redeveloping  and  ""greening""  urban spaces,  proliferating  restorative  forms  of redress,  and  creating  both  safe  harbors  for individuals  at  risk of or fleeing violence  and  alternative  livelihoods  for persons  subject to  criminal law  enforcement. By  exploring prison  abolition  and grounded  preventive justice  in tandem, this Article offers a positive ethical, legal, and institutional framework for conceptualizing  abolition, crime prevention,  and grounded justice together.",cover,McLeod - 2015 - Prison Abolition and Grounded Justice.pdf

"Background principles, like constitutional property itself, have long been rooted in state-specific law. Recently, however, the Supreme Court's turn to jurisdictionless property law has collided with its background principles jurisprudence. The result is a model of background principles based on an unbounded source of general property law that spans centuries and continents. These ascendant general law background principles threaten to systematically undermine property rights while disserving the fundamental premise that those rights derive from social expectations. As the constitutional definition of property continues to evolve, courts and scholars should recognize the potential for general law background principles to dilute property protections.",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"The circuits also had disparate interpretations of the Tax Power injury. The Tax Power injury describes the federal curtailing of a state's ability to exercise its sovereign tax powers, whether because of ambiguity, coercion, or undue federal limitations. Whereas the Spending Contract injury relates to the state's sovereign rights to an uncoerced and unambiguous offer, the Tax Power injury speaks more to the substance of that contract. State plaintiffs, the theory suggests, have a cognizable injury where a spending condition 'casts a pall over' the 'exercise [of their] sovereign tax power.' 219 The Tax Power injury grants standing where federal legislation 'unconstitutionally intrud[es] on [a state's] sovereign authority,' 220 and threatens the state's 'sovereign prerogative to 'tax its residents as it sees fit.'

"But the Offset Provision cases give states too long a leash. A majority of the courts hearing the Offset Provision cases-likely drawing from their underlying, merits-based views of the Spending Clause-found standing for state plaintiffs in every instance of congressional ambiguity. Indeed, those courts also held mostly for the state plaintiffs on the merits. Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes-in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a 'sovereign' policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

There is considerable doubt whether this type of normative distinction can be fully drawn in a kinetic consumerist society. If the value of money is reflexively cashed out in terms of its consequences for consumer welfare, is there anything left for a nonwelfarist reordering of social relations?

"regrettably remains for many people a de facto proxy for criminality. That  proxy  distorts  everything  from  residential  patterns  to  labor market opportunities. 4 Police respond to black and white suspects in different  ways. 5 So  do  judges  and  prosecutors. 6 Partly  as  a  result  of these dynamics, roughly one in three black men (and one in five Latino men) will be incarcerated during their lifetime. 7 At the same time, the criminal  justice  system  imposes  substantial  socioeconomic  costs  on minority citizens not directly touched by policing or prosecutions. In particular, minority children of the incarcerated bear an unconscionable burden as a result of separation from their parents. 8 More  generally,  there  is  substantial  evidence  that  spillover  costs  of producing public safety fall disproportionately on minority groups. 9 As",cover,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf

"Amid  the 2020  uprisings  that began  in  response  to  the  Minneapolis  Police Department's  murder of George  Floyd,  ""defund  and  dismantle  the  police"" emerged as the demands from the streets.  These demands were echoed and etched by protestors in every major city across the country. Only five years  earlier,  after the mass protests following the police killings of  Eric Garner, Michael  Brown, and Freddie Gray,  the most visible  protest demands  included  ""stop killing us"" or the criminal prosecution of individual police officers.  The shift toward demands that seek to dismantle  and defund underlined  the growing power of prison abolitionist organizing. 1 Abolitionist demands have become a terrain for reimagining social, political,  and  economic life.  They are tools for organizing constituencies  around bold ways  of responding  to  today's  crises  of racial  capitalism  and colonialism, including police violence, incarceration, deportation, and the global pandemic.  In their  focus  on  fundamentally  altering  the  structures  that  govern  our  society, abolitionist  demands  present  a  direct  challenge  to  conventional  liberal  reform strategies and offer the possibility of political, economic, and social transformation. 2",cover,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf

"Enforcement  discretion-the  authority  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to legal violations-is central to the operation of  both the federal criminal justice system and the administrative state. Yet its constitutional  underpinnings  are surprisingly  unclear.  Courts  and the executive  branch  have  described  such  discretion,  particularly  in  the criminal  context,  as  a  core  executive authority.' But  the  Take  Care Clause-the  constitutional  provision  most  often  invoked  to  support this assertion-suggests  the opposite: by providing that the  President ""shall  take  Care  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully  executed,"" it  seems  to require  the  President  to  fully  enforce  all  congressional  enactments. 2 Meanwhile, numerous recent controversies have highlighted the importance of  the issue. Under  President  Obama, the  executive branch announced policies of abstaining from investigating and prosecuting certain federal marijuana offenses in states where possession  of  the  drug  is  legal 3 and  delaying  for  substantial  periods the enforcement  of key  provisions of the Affordable  Care Act (""ACA""). 4 Earlier,  the Administration  adopted  a  controversial policy  of declining to  seek  removal  of  certain  sympathetic  undocumented  immigrants who entered the United States as young children. 5  The Administration",cover,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf

"The progressive  prosecution  movement is one of  the most recent  efforts to reform the United States criminal justice system.  In this  Article, I analyze two assumptions that appear  to  be  guiding this movement.  The first is that prosecutors  have unilateral power to change the system.  The  second  is that those who bear  the biggest  burden  of  our current  system black Americans would be the primary  beneficiaries  of the decarceration proposals  advanced by  progressive prosecutors. I  argue  that  each  of  these  assumptions  is misguided. A  successful criminal  justice reform movement  must recognize the  contingent power of prosecutors and actively  seek  to  advance  racial justice  on  top  of  its  decarceration efforts. To  avoid  exacerbating the problems they  intend to  correct, reformists must  reexamine the principles underlying  the movement and the aims they expect to achieve.",cover,Fryer - 2020 - Race_ Reform_ _ Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf

"However, the premise that tort damages are the civilized outgrowth of punitive revenge (the province of criminal law) is belied by the historical practices that entwined the two remedies. We effectively disentangled the two in our earlier thought experiment, which demonstrated how perfect compensation obviates the need for criminal punishment. 88 By implication, the inherent inadequacy of monetary tort remedies generates the rationale for criminal liability: If the only legal response to murder and other forms of highly culpable injury-causing misconduct involved inadequate monetary sanctions, the public peace would be unduly threatened. Hence, the need to criminally punish injury-causing behavior stems from the failure of monetary damages to adequately protect basic tort rights-a relationship between these two fields of the common law opposite from the conventional account.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"186. The requisite logic is inherent within cost-benefit analysis. For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 387, 394-96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder's willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.",footnote,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Much  of what  is  wrong  with  American criminal  justice-its  racial inequity, its  excessive severity,  its  propensity  for  error-is  increasingly blamed  on  prosecutors.' Moreover,  prosecutors seem  to  be  getting  ever more powerful,  not just  in  the  United  States,  but  in much of the  rest  of the world  as  well. 2 The  nature  of prosecutorial  power  and  the  reasons  for its growth remain murky,  though. As a result,  it  is hard to  know  exactly  what to  make  of prosecutors  or  what  we  should  expect  from  them. There  is plenty  of thoughtful,  well-informed  scholarship  on  prosecutors,  especially in the  United  States, but  most of this work is self-consciously  pragmatic. It takes the  modem prosecutor's office  as a given, a dragon that we find living in  our  midst  and  wish  to  tame. My goal  here  is  slightly different,  less immediately  reformist. I want  to step  back and  try  to  understand  the dragon: what  kind of animal it is and why it is with us.",cover,Sklansky - 2016 - The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power Criminology.pdf

Thus,  for example,  the Uniform Commercial Code proscribes ""unconscionable"" contracts, assuming  that someone (e.g., courts and tradesmen) will  give  meaning to  unconscionability. Danzig dubiously notes  that the premise  of such  rules is  ""that values have  an  objectively ascertainable existence and  a  near  universal  acceptance and  thus  can  be  judicially discovered.""

"The reciprocity norm of compensation has ongoing relevance masked by the scarcity of compensatory resources. That scarcity generates the baseline rule of negligence liability supplemented by two different, complementary forms of strict liability: one based on deterrence, the other on fair compensation. This latter rule of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities is the only overtly compensatory rule.

As compared to the tort compensation funded by liability insurance, the costs of injury compensation for these right-holders are substantially reduced by other types of insurance mechanisms, such as health insurance. 194 The primary value of liability insurance for tort purposes instead involves the manner in which it reduces the cost of the tort obligation for duty-bearers, including those who then pass such cost savings onto right-holders by reducing prices.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Until the twentieth century, however, the same underlying problem of scarce compensatory resources made it unjustifiable to prioritize security over liberty. In the early stages of economic development, a society must expend most of its wealth to satisfy basic needs like hunger and shelter. The per capita GDP in the United States in 1820, for example, was $1,287 measured in 1990 international dollars (equal to around $3,150 today). 118 For the ordinary person, an obligation to compensate another's injury would largely or wholly drain the financial resources minimally required to maintain a healthy existence. In this era, the ordinary right-holder's interest in physical security was normatively indistinguishable from the ordinary duty-bearer's interest in having sufficient financial assets to buy food and shelter; tort law could not defensibly prioritize one interest over the other.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Throughout its varied elements, the negligence rule accounts for the important substantive implications flowing from the manner in which scarce compensatory resources lead to the problem of imperfect injury compensation and the concomitant need to prevent these irreparable harms. The resultant, behaviorally demanding standard of reasonable care effectively functions as a rule of no-fault or strict liability in many cases, explaining why one can breach that duty and cause irreparable injury without incurring any obligation beyond the duty to pay (inherently inadequate) compensatory damages. However, when a defendant reprehensibly breaches the duty, the payment of compensatory damages does not adequately correct for the injustice of wrongfully causing irreparable harm. The normative value of preventing these irreparable injuries accordingly justifies punishing the wrongdoer for a bad-faith breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care, warranting awards of punitive damages and, in some cases, the imposition of criminal negligence liability.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Abolitionist  campaigns  often identify  the  carceral  state  as  a  root source  of violence and  inequality, and  assert  the  road  to  a  more  free  and sustainable future lays within its undoing. 3 We explore abolitionist frameworks for thinking about demands that aim to shrink and delegitimize the prison industrial complex (PIC) -which includes police-in service of  moving away from a society focused on punishment to one rooted in collective care and social provision.  While we are under no illusion that abolitionist frameworks  are perfect or complete-or that there is any one blueprint for transformation-we  believe  abolition is key to building a more just world.

"You can't question a secret you haven't been told. The criminal legal system depends on fair and open proceedings to expose and regulate unlawful and unconstitutional police conduct through the courts. If police can use claims of secrecy to systematically thwart criminal defendants' access to evidence, judicial review will fail. And yet that is exactly what is happening under a common-law doctrine called the 'law enforcement privilege.' The privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while withholding information from the defense about how those methods work. It risks perpetuating unconstitutional conduct, enabling wrongful convictions, and rendering Fourth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Brady , and statutory discovery laws moot. At the same time, it has a non-frivolous policy rationale. If all police investigative methods were public information, then more people committing crimes could evade detection.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"According to its proponents, the key insight of holistic defense is that to be truly effective advocates for their clients, defenders must adopt a broader understanding of the scope of their work with their clients. Defenders must address both the enmeshed, or collateral, legal consequences of criminal justice involvement (such as loss of employment, public housing, custody of ones children, and immigration status), as well as underlying nonlegal issues that often play a role in driving clients into the criminal justice system in the first place. 3 To this end, holistic defender offices are staffed not only by criminal defense lawyers and related support staff (investigators and paralegals) but also by civil, family, and immigration lawyers as well as social workers and nonlawyer advocates, all working collectively and on an equal footing with criminal defense lawyers. This holistic model contrasts with the traditional public defense model, which focuses almost exclusively on criminal representation.",cover,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf

"The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, it must compensate the property owner. 1 One exception to this rule, the 'background principles' exception, establishes that 'the government does not take a property interest when it merely asserts a 'pre-existing limitation upon the land owner's title.'' 2 For instance, if a landowner is creating a nuisance on his property, the government owes him no compensation for forcing him to stop, 'because he never had the right to engage in the nuisance in the first place.' 3 The concept is simple: One cannot lose what was never his. 4",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"As is true for the cases on which it relied, the court did not mention the problem of insolvency and the associated need to prioritize the claims of physically harmed victims. The tort duty encompassed physical harms, just like it did in the hypothetical automobile accident the court discussed in which the 'defendant would of course be liable for 'personal injuries and property damage.' ' If the duty in these cases were expanded to encompass both the physically harmed victim(s) and those who might suffer foreseeable economic losses, there would be a massive increase in the number of tort claimants, as the California Supreme Court recognized. That liability would be excessive insofar as insolvency would be a predictable consequence, leading to the question of why insolvency provides a principled reason to limit the substantive tort duty.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Although the Restatements in which Cedar Point , Baker , and Slaybaugh found background principles are useful sources for studying a given body of law's general principles, they are written at a high level of abstraction and thus do not encompass any single jurisdiction's nuanced common law. 170 Meanwhile, a more particularized inquiry into state law requires reckoning with the nuts and bolts of state statutes and common law. 171 If one concedes that increased abstraction leads to less property protection in the background-limitations context, then the courts' use of generalized sources of law only supports the conclusion that a takings doctrine based on jurisdictionless background principles poses the endemic risk of underprotecting property.",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property
"In negotiating IIAs, the state is contracting for the benefit of its people. Entering into IIAs can invite foreign investment to stimulate the local economy, create jobs, and set clear expectations on both sides of the transaction. 91 Thus, states enter into these agreements to further the best interests of their beneficiary population. But difficulties arise when human rights obligations come into conflict with investors' rights. This issue can be remedied by using the fiduciary theory of sovereignty as a guiding framework both in interpreting the IIA in question and in understanding a state's authority to negotiate the agreement in the first place.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The situation is made worse by armed groups that use the difficulty of distinguishing between their members and civilians to their advantage, embedding their activities in areas with large numbers of civilians whom they exploit as human shields, in an act some have referred to as 'lawfare'-the use of legal rules by nonstate actors and other groups to undermine the advantage of their more powerful law-abiding adversaries. 29 Although these armed groups are to blame for entrapping civilians and, in some cases, 'baiting' counterinsurgents into attacking them, 30 the concept of dual-use objects plays into their hands by dramatically expanding the scope of legitimate targets to include almost anything. Indeed, when conflict takes place against nonstate actors in densely populated areas, much of the infrastructure and underpinnings of the economy critical to civilian thriving might be labeled dual-use objects.",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War

"Nested in section 553 of the APA is a tactic rarely discussed in notice-andcomment legal scholarship. Good cause rulemaking refers to the exception articulated in the APA that allows an agency to forgo notice and comment 'when the agency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.' 75 The exception has been invoked and litigated in a number of lower court cases, 76 but the exact meaning of 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest' has not been addressed by the Supreme Court, 77 leaving it unclear exactly when agencies can use the good cause exception. 78 Given the challenges with notice and comment, the issue seems ripe for review. However, even if the Court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking. They should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself. A twofold approach-good cause rulemaking combined with practicable, modern means of public engagement-has a chance of surviving judicial scrutiny.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

No administrator in Washington turns to full-scale notice-and-comment rulemaking when she is genuinely interested in obtaining input from interested parties. Notice-and-comment rulemaking is to public participation as Japanese Kabuki theater is to human passions-a highly stylized process for displaying in a formal way the essence of something which in real life takes place in other venues. 1,body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

It clarifies the state's authority when entering into IIAs and can help redirect a legal regime in crisis. This system could accomplish a lot of goodif it is realigned to serve those from whom state sovereignty emanates.

"As a result, the policy rationale for the privilege is effectively a meaningless constraint. Of course, law enforcement officers do not always claim the privilege. Why? Practically speaking, what limits threshold claims to the law enforcement privilege under current doctrine may be simply the logistical difficulty of deploying a method while keeping it secret. If law enforcement has the technical capacity to keep a method secret while using it in the field, then there is a good chance that current privilege law will let them keep it secret in court as well.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

While  scholars  have  documented the enormous  role prosecutors play  in virtually  every aspect of criminal law's administration and how  that leads  to the mass  incarceration we  currently have in America, 3 Bazelon's  book stands out for  its  ability to  make  this connection  vivid  and comprehensible  to an  average  reader with  no  legal  training or  deep  policy  expertise.

"Consider the customary practices in the state of nature that first defined the common law. In this era, injury victims had the remedial alternatives of pursuing punishment-'an eye for an eye'-or receiving compensation-'the value of an eye for an eye.' As we have found, these two remedies are complementary responses to the scarcity of compensatory resources and the resultant problem of imperfect injury compensation. 164 The early common law then improved upon this remedial scheme by having the state exact punishment through the criminal law, enabling victims to pursue tort claims for compensation. 165 Despite this important legal development, the normative fact remained that the victim suffered grievous injury and deserved compensation embodied in the entitlement of the 'value of an eye for an eye.'",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Nor was the distinction a difference between the kinds of persons who could initiate the actions. Victims could initiate actions of both kinds. According to the lawyers, victims who preferred vengeance over compensation prosecuted their wrongdoers for crime.

"Factoring law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct into courts' assessment of privilege claims will cabin law enforcement's secrecy power while minimizing risks to law enforcement efficacy. Appellate courts should use their common-law authority over evidentiary privileges to require that claimants divulge the conditions of prior dissemination when asserting a threshold claim to the law enforcement privilege. Meanwhile, trial courts should include these requirements in their standing orders for how to assert a privilege claim. If courts fail to do so, or in states where courts lack common-law authority over privileges, 291 legislators should codify the requirements, either in evidence codes or in Community Control Over Police Surveillance laws. 292 This Part concludes by addressing likely counterarguments and explaining why they are ultimately unpersuasive.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Part III turns from positive to normative. It offers a skeptical account of existing arguments against the privilege, drawing from litigation documents and the small amount of prior scholarship on the topic. It begins by debunking the current scholarly consensus that there was no privilege for law enforcement methods at common law. That view is almost certainly wrong and invites a naïve underestimation of the privilege's intractability. Next, Part III considers prior arguments that the privilege should be abolished entirely or should not apply to information possessed by private entities.

"The argument I put forward in this Article may seem  radical,  but  if  I  may  channel  Ralph  Ellison,  ""[b]ear  with  me."" 10 Because I subscribe to the belief that ""subject position is everything in  my analysis  of the law,""""  it is worth disclosing that  I come to this argument not just as a criminal justice scholar but also as a former federal  prosecutor.  That argument is this:  it is time to turn away from prosecution as we know it.  As  a federal prosecutor  I  put hundreds  of defendants,  mostly  brown  and black  and almost always  poor, in prison as part of the War on Drugs.

In this  article,  for  purposes  of  discussing  racial  bias  and criminal justice, I  will sometimes  use  the  term Black  survivors and sometimes survivors  ""of  color"" depending  on the  context,  the  research to  which I refer,  and the  impact on intersectional  identities.  I feel it  is  important to  identify for  purposes  of  racial  justice  not  only  those  who  consider themselves  non-majoritarian/nonwhite but also  those  perceived  by  criminal justice  actors or  intimate  partners  as  nonwhite. The  term ""of color""  as  I  use  it includes Black,  nonHispanic  Black  (referred to  in  the research  at  times  as  African-Americans), Native  and Indigenous  Peoples,  Hispanic,  Latinx who  are of color,  Asians  (far eastern,  southeastern and Pacific  Islanders),  and Middle  Easterners.

"Through the  stories  of Noura's and  Kevin's cases,  Bazelon  vividly  shows how prosecutors  hold  the  keys to  someone's liberty.  They make  the critical decisions about what to  charge, whether  to seek pretrial  detention,  and what sentence  to  pursue.  Bazelon  demonstrates  that courts largely remain  on the sidelines  for these  determinations  because  of the  deference  they give prosecutors.  Although  judges could  release  pretrial  defendants  on bail  even  when prosecutors  ask that they be detained,  ""[i]n  practice,  judges  almost never  defy the prosecution  by setting  low bail  when a crime  involves  sex or violence"" (p. 37).  That is because most state judges are  elected,  and they do not want to be deemed  responsible if someone  released  pretrial commits  a crime that attracts  media  attention.  And  as  Bazelon  notes,  ""[a] judge  who lets  out  a  defendant  over  the objections  of a prosecutor  is  especially  vulnerable""  (p. 37). So  judges  normally  agree  to  whatever  bail  amount  a  prosecutor  requests (p. 39).  Courts  typically  let prosecutors  use  evidence  obtained  by  the police even when  there  are  serious  doubts  that  evidence  was  legally  obtained  because judges tend to believe  the police's  version  of events  (p. 29).  They fail  to enforce prosecutors'  constitutional  obligation  to  turn  over  exculpatory  evidence by finding most violations harmless (p.  105).",cover,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf

"Ferguson has come  to  symbolize  a  widespread sense  that there  is  a crisis in American criminal  justice. This Article describes  various articulations  of what the problems  are and  poses the question of  whether law is capable of  fixing these problems. I  consider  the question theoretically by looking at claims that critical race theorists have made  about law and race. Using Supreme Court cases as examples, I  demonstrate how  some of the  ""problems"" described in the  U.S. Justice Department's  Ferguson report,  like police violence and widespread arrests  of  African-Americans for petty offenses, are not only legal, but integral features of  policing and punishment in the  United States. They  are how the system  is supposed to work.  The  conservatives on  the  Court are  aware, and intend, that the expansive  powers  they grant the  police  will  be  exercised  primarily against  African-American men.  I  then  consider the  question of reform using  empirical analysis  of one  of the  most popular legal  remedies: ""pattern  or practice"" investigations by  the  U.S.  Department of Justice. Some  reforms are stopgap measures that provide limited help but  fail to bring about the  transformation  demanded by  the  strongest articulations of the crisis.  In fact, in some ways,  reform efforts  impede transformation. I  conclude by  imagining the  wholesale transformation necessary to fix the kinds of  problems articulated by  the Movement  for Black Lives.",cover,Butler - 2019 - The system is working the way it is supposed to the limits of criminal justice reform.pdf

"At its best, international investment law can facilitate economic growth, connect economies across the globe, and help states attract investment for particular industries to enhance economic resilience. 184 This regime can be a tool for good, but it is fundamentally undermined by its complicated relationship with human rights. Human rights are not for sale. Nor are they a bargaining chip at the negotiating table. Instead, the protection of a citizenry's human rights is a state's raison d'être. Bear Creek v. Peru , Suez v. Argentina , and Eco Oro v. Colombia are important reminders of how international investment law can fail those people and purposes it is meant to serve.

"International investment law provides stability for investors, helps capital flow across the globe, and can be a critical tool for sustainable development. This regime, however, has become increasingly controversial, in part due to its inability to reconcile investor obligations with competing human rights obligations. International investment treaties provide substantive guarantees to investors, including submission to binding arbitration in the event of breach. When found in breach of one of these guarantees, international investment arbitral tribunal awards are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially creating 'regulatory chill' for states that may otherwise take affirmative action to protect human rights out of concern that regulation may run afoul of their treaties' international investment provisions.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"That  said,  Bazelon  and the  voters  and  activists  who  have  helped  elect progressive  prosecutors  are  right  that this  movement  has  the potential  to be transformative.  But bigger  changes  will happen  only  if these prosecutors  do more  than  seek  to  exercise  the  vast  discretion  of their  offices  more  wisely than their predecessors.  They need to  advocate  for institutional  changes,  including  changes  that  limit  the  leverage  prosecutors  have  over  defendants. Part  III thus identifies key  institutional reforms  that are  necessary to achieve more fundamental  change.  At their core,  these ideas  require placing  significant  checks  on  the powers  prosecutors  exercise  instead  of trying  to  change the type of people who  occupy those roles and how they exercise their broad discretion. Part  III  will  provide  a  summary  of what  some  of  those  checks should  look  like.  In  addition to  providing  a  list  of  needed  reforms,  this summary  can  serve  as  a  checklist  to  evaluate  prosecutors  who  claim  to  be progressive.

"Another reason not to totally abolish the privilege is that it could perversely result in law enforcement maintaining the same level of secrecy through even more socially harmful means. Prosecutors facing disclose-ordismiss dilemmas might withdraw more criminal charges, maintaining secrecy by allowing alleged perpetrators of dangerous crimes to return to the community where they could harm future victims. Judges might 'bend' the rules of evidence to deny discovery based on irrelevance. 249 And police might rely more on the parallel construction technique of conducting an initial investigation with secret methods followed by a second to re-discover evidence using alternate, public methods, leaving courts, prosecutors, and defendants alike unaware that any secret exists at all. 250 In contrast, keeping the privilege as a lawful avenue for justified secrecy could make parallel construction appear all the more unreasonable and encourage judges to curtail it. 251",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"If a state violates the Offset Provision, the statute authorizes the Treasury to recoup the lesser of 'the amount of the applicable reduction to net tax revenue attributable to such violation' and the amount of money the state or territory received from the CSLFRF. 43 Essentially, states would have to pay back any of this federal money that they used to subsidize their tax cuts. 44 For example, a state could not cut its property taxes and use the CSLFRF funds to make up the difference. As professors Conor Clarke and Edward Fox explain, the Offset Provision is a variation on 'maintenance-of-effort' provisions common in federal education programs designed to ensure that federal money 'supplements and not supplants' state spending. 45 Interestingly enough, unlike other maintenance-of-effort provisions, Clarke and Fox argue that the Offset Provision is a far more flexible constraint than those in prior versions of the provision, ensuring that more federal dollars are used to support state and local governments than an equivalent 'earmarked' spending program. 46",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"One place to  look  for an  answer  is in  the law  and  literature of plea bargaining  as  contract. Plea  bargains are, as  the  name  suggests, bargains; it seems natural to  argue  that they  should  be  regulated and  evaluated accordingly. But while that argument is common, there is little agreement on  where  it leads. Two of the  harshest and  most  influential critics of  plea bargaining, Albert Alschuler and  Stephen Schulhofer, maintain that contract theory supports prohibiting any bargained-for allocation of criminal punishment. 6 The  courts, on  the other hand, have  proceeded to  construct a  body  of  contract-based law  to  regulate the plea bargaining process, taking for granted the efficiency and  decency  of the process being  regulated. The many  academic arguments  for  abolishing (or  at  least severely restricting) plea  bargaining have thus  been largely ignored. It  is tempting to  explain this reaction as  a  product  of the  chasm between  an  overly fastidious academic world and the  unpleasant realities of  modem criminal processes. But  the  intuition that plea bargaining is  fundamentally flawed  is too strong and  too  widespread to  be  so  casually dismissed.",cover,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf

"'Decisions . . . are matters of policy, not principle,' when 'they must be tested by asking whether they advance the overall goal [of promoting the general good], not whether they give each citizen what he is entitled to have as an individual.' 32 For example, the general good might be promoted by discriminatory practices against a minority of individuals in violation of their rights. The rights individuals hold against others, even a majority of them, accordingly turn on matters of principle, not policy. Thus, to properly protect tort rights and enforce their correlative duties, '[j]udges must make their common-law decisions on grounds of principle, not policy.' 33",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"In  litigation,  forum  matters.  Nowhere  is  that  more  true  than  in  criminal litigation,  where the choice  of court in which to prosecute -state or federal -is perhaps  the single most significant factor  influencing  a case's outcome.  All else being  equal, a  defendant  prosecuted in  federal court  is  more likely  to  be convicted,  and to receive  a  longer sentence  of  imprisonment,  than if  prosecuted for  the  same  conduct  in  state  court.'  The  disparity has  received  particular attention  in  the  area  of so-called  ""street  crimes"" -the drug,  gun,  and  violent offenses  that make up the bulk of urban criminal felony dockets -because  these are  the  sorts  of crimes  that  many  argue  have  historically  been  (and  should continue  to  be)  left  largely  to  the states. 2 For  all  the  focus  on the  merits  and equities  of  federal  prosecution of  street  crime, though,  there  has  been  no concerted  exploration  of the antecedent  question:  why do  the  disparities  exist in the first place?",cover,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf
"Frank's book focuses  largely on incarceration,  but there is a host  of  surrounding  policies  as  well  that  share  this  trait,  that seem to serve  this retributive urge  for harsher punishment but ultimately represent in my view bad management. And in that I mean that they  are  failing their goal  if the  goal is  to make  the best  use of our limited public  resources.  I  am  going to highlight just a  few  resources  from my book to  give you a  sense  of what I am talking about.  The opening chapter explains  a dynamic that we  have in criminal  law  in  the  United  States  which  is  that we lump  together people  of really different levels  of culpability and we treat them all as if they are the worst possible offense in that category.1 4  And there are lots of examples  of this, but  in the interests of time I'll just give you a  couple.",cover,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf
"The law enforcement privilege is not the only way police conceal illegal methods, but it may be the least costly for them. Police do not need a special secrecy power if they never introduce the results of secret investigative methods in court. Alternately, they can conceal their methods through 'parallel construction,' a constitutionally suspect tactic of conducting a second, transparent investigation to rediscover evidence in a judicially palatable form. 79 Those techniques at least impose some cost on police that can curtail their adoption.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Damages are the standard remedy for personal injury only because personal injuries can rarely be anticipated in time to prevent them by injunction. But where an injunction is possible, the irreparable injury rule is obviously satisfied: if it happens, the physical injury to the plaintiff will be irreparable. The most common examples are injunctions against family violence . . . . The issue also arises when courts are asked to enjoin conduct that creates a risk of serious injury. When the risk is great enough, those injunctions are routinely granted. 136",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The  necessary  reforms  of our carceral system  must  begin  with  the prosecutor.  Our  adversarial system of justice  so  compellingly  turns prosecutors  away  from doing  justice to maximizing convictions that it can seem impossible to be  both a good  person and a good prosecutor. When even progressive  prosecutors can be  turned into win-seekers rather than neutral  agents  of justice,  Blackness  is  punished.  Black  people  are disproportionally  arrested, charged, convicted,  and sentenced  for longer than the  population  overall. Rejecting adversarialism  is therefore  essential, but that alone will not be enough-in order to  act in the interest of  justice, a  prosecutor must  consciously  replace  adversarialism as  a  guiding ideology.",cover,Hasbrouck - 2021 - The Just Prosecutor.pdf

"technologies that police generally use solely for investigative leads. 98 For instance, consider police use of internet monitoring software to identify computers that appear to be sharing digital contraband. Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 In all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"The Ninth Circuit likewise believed the Spending Contract injury did not require any imminent agency enforcement. However, it is difficult to say whether the Ninth Circuit is in step with the Fifth Circuit because Arizona v. Yellen held in the alternative that the Treasury's recoupment was sufficiently imminent to allow for pre-enforcement standing on nonsovereign grounds. 190 But the court specifically tied the Spending Contract injury to a spending condition (the Offset Provision) that clouded the offer of federal funds, as opposed to the enforcement of that condition, meaning that no enforcement would actually be required. 191 The intangible injury to a state's 'ability to exercise' its sovereign judgment and fairly accept or reject Congress's 'quasi-contractual funding offer,' allows the state to challenge unconstitutional terms 'at the outset.' 192 Moreover, Arizona's case was not mooted even after its acceptance of the CSLFRF. 193 In his concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson seemed to confirm that the Ninth Circuit's conception of the Spending Contract injury did not require imminence. 194",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"One approach that continues to gain support is holistic defense, in which public defenders work in interdisciplinary teams to address both the immediate case and the underlying life circumstances - such as drug addiction, mental illness, or family or housing instability - that contribute to client contact with the criminal justice system. Holistic defense contrasts with the traditional public defense model that emphasizes criminal representation and courtroom advocacy. Proponents contend holistic defense improves case outcomes and reduces recidivism by better addressing clients' underlying needs, while critics argue that diverting resources and attention from criminal advocacy weakens results. Although the holistic approach is widely embraced, there is no systematic evidence demonstrating the relative merits of the holistic approach.",cover,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf

Nor, given the ubiquity of emotional harms, is it likely to be.' 223 Similarly, the Restatement (Third) of Torts recognizes that '[a]n actor has no general duty to avoid the unintentional infliction of economic loss on another.' 224 Negligence liability is ordinarily limited to cases of physical harma limitation of liability embodied in the physical-harm or physical-injury requirement.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The challenges facing notice and comment are well-documented in legal scholarship. Although the APA's framers originally imagined the process as a tool to ensure 'all interested parties' have a voice in the rulemaking process to guarantee a 'democratic procedure,' 46 that vision has been corrupted on three levels. First, opportunities to manipulate the system through technological advances have rapidly expanded. Second, the complexity of the process enables groups with more resources to access the system while it remains inaccessible to others, privileging those well-resourced voices. Third, agencies lack the resources to respond when litigants challenge the adequacy of notice-and-comment procedures.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking
"In  theory,  prosecutors  are  beholden  to  the  public  interest  or justice. These  concepts,  however,  are  so  diffuse  and  elastic  that they  do not constrain prosecutors  much,  certainly not in  the way  that an identifiable  client would.  As  I  have  argued  elsewhere,  prosecution  is  a lowvisibility  process  about which  the  public  has poor information  and  little right to participate. 5 District  attorneys' electoral  contests are  rarely measured assessments of a prosecutor's overall  performance. At best, campaign  issues  boil  down to  boasts  about  conviction  rates, a  few high-profile  cases,  and  maybe  a  scandal. The  advantages  of incumbency  and  name  recognition  are  also  huge. Moreover,  a  district  attorney's subordinates  are  unelected  and  often  operate  with  remarkably little oversight.",cover,Bibas - 2008 - Prosecutorial Regulation versus Prosecutorial Accountability.pdf

"The fiduciary theory has numerous potential means of adoption. It can be implemented through the contractual approach, which informs how specific treaty provisions in next-generation IIAs are drafted. This approach suggests that states should explicitly incorporate the fiduciary theory into new IIAs going forward. The fiduciary theory can also be incorporated into the judicial approach, which focuses on the interpretation of existing treaties. The judicial approach advocates for arbitrators to consider the fiduciary theory when interpreting IIAs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace. As already discussed, this regime is adrift when it comes to reconciling this fundamental tension. The fiduciary theory provides not only a theoretical framework, but also an actionable path forward to lend legitimacy to an increasingly controversial legal regime.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

They argue that a 'congressional Office of Legislative Counsel (OLC)' could safeguard Congress's prerogatives in the face of executive and judicial aggrandizement. Recently, these calls have prompted Congress to consider creating such a body.

Hampton, 61  N.J.  250 (1972),  our  Supreme Court  faced  the  problem whether  a certain set  of  facts warranted  prosecution for kidnapping with  its attendant thirty year  minimum  sentence. In  that case, the  evidence  showed that the  defendant had forced  the  victim to  drive  him around  town for over  an hour  at  gun point and so frightened her  that she  attempted to  flee  and was thereafter shot. The Court  held  that the  kidnapping charge  could  be brought and the  conviction was upheld. However, it made  abundantly  clear  that  the prosecutor  had  not only the power, but the responsibility not to prosecute  on  such serious  charges  where the facts, though technically sufficient, do  not  warrant prosecution.

"In  several  respects,  progressive  prosecutors tend  to  resemble  other  political actors-that  is,  other  elected executive-branch  officials  or  legislators-more  than judges.  They  often draw  support from left-leaning  political  action committees  and further  support  from a  national progressive  constituency. 1 0 Once  elected,  progressive  prosecutors  have  adopted  and  announced  policies  directed  at reducing  incarceration  or  promoting  racial  equity  in  criminal  law  enforcement."" Often,  these policies  involve declining  to prosecute categories  of low-level crimes, declining  to employ sentencing enhancements,  or declining to seek pretrial incarceration in certain  types  of cases. 1 2 Where  traditional  prosecutors  purported  to  make  individual discretionary  decisions  based  on  considerations  internal  to  criminal  law  enforcement,  such  as  whether  a prosecution  would promote  deterrence  or  retribution  or would  be  disproportionately  harsh  given  the nature  of the  criminal  conduct,  progressive  prosecutors'  categorical  policies  appear  more  political because  they  are based  on  explicit  public-policy  judgments  external  to  the  individual  facts  of the case.13  Further,  these  prosecutors' categorical  declination  policies  invite political controversy  because  they  appear  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  political  judgments underlying  the  criminal laws-namely,  a judgment  by  legislators  that  the laws  in question  should  at  least  sometimes  be  enforced. 14 Finally,  in  announcing  broad policies-not  simply  announcing  individual  indictments  and  convictions-progressive  prosecutors  often  appear  more  like other  political  actors  in  the sense  that they seem to be making law, not just enforcing it in  individual cases.",cover,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf

"88. Michael C. Jensen, Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow, Corporate Finance, and Takeovers , 76 AM. ECON. REV. 323 (1986). As an example of a paradigmatic agency problem, imagine a director at Company A who, on the side, owns his own consulting firm. When Company A needs consulting services, this director may use his management power to ensure that his firm wins the consulting contract, perhaps even charging Company A above-market consulting fees. To do so would be in the director's best interest but not that of the shareholders. While shareholders bear the consequences of such decisions, they themselves cannot exercise managerial control to vindicate their own interests.",footnote,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The key  to  the growing  prominence of  prosecutors, both in the  United States and elsewhere,  lies in  the prosecutor's  preeminent  ability to bridge organizational  and conceptual  divides in criminal  justice. Above  all else, prosecutors  are  mediating  figures, straddling  the  frontiers  between adversarial  and inquisitorial justice, between the police and the courts, and between  law  and discretion. By blurring these boundaries, prosecutors provide the criminal  justice  system  with three different kinds offlexibilityideological, institutional, and operational-and  they strengthen their own hands in a legal culture  that increasingly  disfavors institutional  rigidity and hard-and-fast  commitments. At  the same time,  though,  the mediating role of the prosecutor  frustrates traditional  strategies  for holding government accountable. The  bridges  that prosecutors provide-between  law  and politics, rules and discretion, courts and  police,  advocacy and  objectivitymake  curtailing  prosecutorial  power and taming prosecutorial  discretion trickier business  than  is  often  suggested,  or  at  least a  different  kind  of business.",cover,Sklansky - 2016 - The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power Criminology.pdf

"Although this compensatory form of strict liability now has limited application, it has an important implication for the normative properties of tort law. A purely compensatory tort rule, by definition, is wholly justified in terms of fair or reasonable injury compensation and not by injury deterrence (unlike negligence and related rules of strict liability formulated to overcome the evidentiary hurdles of proving negligence liability). A purely compensatory tort rule is allocatively inefficient: The compensatory transfer merely shifts the injury costs from one party to the other while creating the associated transaction costs. In the absence of deterrence, social costs are minimized by letting the loss fall on the injured accident victim. How, then, can a compensatory rule of strict liability be squared with the normative calculus of tort law defined in terms of both welfarist and nonwelfarist rationales for tort liability?",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Meanwhile, maintaining confidentiality has costs of its own that will predictably discourage law enforcement from adopting excessive precautions. Maintaining confidentiality may require limiting the number of people who can use an investigative technique or otherwise constraining the circumstances of its use. It may present obstacles for collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners. It may require routine tracking of sensitive information, demanding the return or destruction of information following use, or independent investigations and disciplinary actions to enforce against unauthorized disclosures. Cumulatively, such costs could be substantial.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Some legal scholars have posited a fiduciary theory of statehood, whereby a state owes a fiduciary duty to its people, much like that in domestic corporate law. This Note proposes looking to the fiduciary theory of statehood for a path forward. It then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders). The fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime.

"History  makes  a fleeting appearance  in  recent debates  about  reforming  the prosecutor's office. Opponents of  the  way discretion is  currently exercised often contend  that  because  a prosecutor is a public  servant, he ought to protect defendants' rights as  well  as  convict the  guilty.' When  this position is  couched  in historical terms, it appeals to  a  prosecutorial self-image, purportedly rooted in  the past, to  promote  fairness and  to  curtail the  excesses of  the adversary system. Bruce Green asserts, for example, that the  ""prosecutor's duty  to  'seek justice' . . . . dates back  well  over  a  century."" 2 Advocates  of  victims' rights and  the  re-privatization of criminal justice also tend to  assume  that private prosecution in  early America  gave way to  impartial, or  even defendant-protective, government  control. 3  This  com-",cover,Ramsey - 2002 - The Discretionary Power of Public Prosecutors in Historical Perspective.pdf

"Progressive  prosecutors differ from  their more  traditional counterparts  primarily in the way  in which they make decisions. They tend to  bind their  discretion by  announcing  categorical  policies rather  than making  fact-based  decisions case by  case. This Article catalogs the unusual degree of  pushback  progressive  prosecutors have  encountered  from  the public,  legislatures, courts, police,  and their own  subordinate  prosecutors.  Drawing  on fiduciary theory,  it explains this reaction as a response to progressive  prosecutors'  abdication  of their  fiduciary role. As a  public fiduciary, prosecutors are  entrusted with  protecting the  public's abstract  interest  in justice, and an integral  part of this role is exercising discretion in  individual  cases based on a broad array of relevant considerations.  This ad hoc discretionary  decision-making  process assures  the public that  prosecutors are  drawing  on  their  expertise  to  pursue justice in  a  basic  sense  rather than coopting the process  for the benefit of some subset of the public. The Article concludes  by  suggesting ways  in  which  progressive  prosecutors can pursue  their conception of  justice while still adhering  to  the  fiduciary role.",cover,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf

"In a pluralist tort system, ordinary money can function as social currency only if its commercial or commodified meaning is socially distinguishable from its normative meaning in reordering the relationship between a plaintiff and defendant. This distinction explains why the damages rule only requires 'some pecuniary return' for nonmonetary injuries rather than the amount that would fully restore the plaintiff's welfare to the pre-injury state. 'Some pecuniary return' can be adequately compensatory in a normative sense even if its market value does not fully restore the plaintiff's welfare to the pre-injury state.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

But abolition is  not the  only  possibility-though it is the  only one  that has  received sustained academic  attention. Indeed, the  single-minded academic  focus  on abolition may have  contributed to  a  second-order problem:  the development  of legal doctrine that makes strategic bargaining problems worse  rather than better. By altering the doctrine that governs such  issues as  when and  how bargains are enforced, the consequences of defendants' mistakes, and  how background prices (i.e., post-trial sentences) are set, the state can  reduce the incentives for strategic bargaining and improve the  efficiency and fairness of  the  plea  bargaining process.",cover,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf

"First, money is a poor substitute for bodily injury-there is not enough money to compensate for a lost life, and money does not perfectly replace broken bones or fully correct for the fundamental alteration of one's life. Recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented ex ante instead of being compensated ex post with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy. The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury. The normative importance of injury prevention, in turn, justifies both punitive damages and criminal punishment for culpable forms of injury-causing behavior. The compensatory limitations of tort liability accordingly shape the criminal law, contradicting the conventional account that treats tort law as the civilized outgrowth of the punitive practices that organize the criminal law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"In the domestic commercial law context, fiduciary duties include a duty of good faith. 148 The duty of good faith prohibits the conscious disregard of known duties. 149 It further requires that fiduciaries act in the best interest of the beneficiary entity. 150 As seen in the international law scholarship, conceiving of the state as a fiduciary imagines it as more than a passive repository of sovereignty. 151 Instead, a state's legitimacy is derived from its mandate to act for the benefit of its people. This understanding is reflected in Pillar I of the United Nations Guiding Principles: The state has an affirmative obligation to protect its population's human rights. With the fiduciary theory animating, this command more strongly compels the state to protect human rights. Protection is not a passive endeavor. It must be pursued actively in all areas where the state exercises sovereignty.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"Part IV ends by suggesting avenues for reform. First, courts should, where resources permit, be far more open to recruiting counsel for imprisoned plaintiffs embarking upon discovery. Second, courts should standardize the discovery process in prison litigation, creating certain tailored discovery rules for imprisoned litigants' claims. Third, judges should intervene through telephonic status conferences to advise plaintiffs on the process and ensure that they are not floundering or getting the runaround. Fourth, courts should take creative approaches to widening the availability of discovery tools, including making use of new technology to broaden incarcerated litigants' access to oral depositions. And finally, there should be efforts both in and out of court to police the creation, storage, and disclosure of evidence. This includes spoliation sanctions or curative measures when prisons overwrite surveillance footage after someone has filed a grievance implicating that footage. It also means devising standardized protocols for flagging evidence that poses security risks, along with safe procedures to handle that evidence's production and use.

"These provisions would be a redundancy measure, or a 'belt and suspenders' approach, given that an explicit provision would merely affirm rather than create the state's fiduciary duty to its people. Redundancy measures, however, are used in both international and domestic law. 97 Often, treaties merely codify existing international law and obligations that previously existed only through customary international law. 98 To include such a provision in IIAs, which reflect an existing notion of sovereignty, would be in line with the logic of treaties in general-memorializing obligations, preexisting or otherwise, to ensure that states receive the benefits of their bargains.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The same kind of compensatory practices recurred throughout ancient societies. 54 Absent a centralized government for protecting individuals from being attacked by others, attaining full compensation or equitable balance within the normative realm of honor was extraordinarily important for reasons William Miller forcefully emphasizes: 'Honor was what provided the basis for your counting for something, for your being listened to, for having people have second thoughts before taking your land or raping you or your daughter.' 55 By compensating for the victim's loss of honor, as Graeber explains, the injurer's payment of social currency also restored the victim's 'power, in the sense of the ability to protect oneself, and one's family and followers, from any sort of degradation or insult.' 56 Receiving full compensation enabled the victim to regain lost honor and thereby eliminate the concomitant vulnerability to future attacks, demonstrating why this remedy was vitally important in the state of nature.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"In the state of nature, full compensation could be attained for fatal injuries only because the entitlement was held by the family, clan, or tribe to which the decedent belonged. 68 In these ancient societies, as Henry Sumner Maine explained, the individual's status within 'the household of which he forms a part' largely determined 'the rules which he obeys,' leaving 'the very smallest room for Contract' or the ability of individuals to mutually agree upon the rights and duties governing their interactions. 69 As Maine then famously demonstrated, the development of 'progressive societies' involved 'a movement from Status to Contract .' 70 Onceindividuals were freed from the shackles of their status within the collective and could voluntarily create their own rights and duties, any entitlement to compensation was their own and not held by the collective to which they belonged. The development of individual rights had compensatory consequences-in the event of fatal injury, the decedent right-holder could never be compensated after the fact with monetary damages, an inherent compensatory problem that did not exist in the state of nature.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"A B  ST R ACT. A defining feature  of criminal federalism  is extreme disparities  in  case  outcomes across  state  and federal  forums.  All else  being equal,  prosecution  in  the  federal  forum entails  a significantly  higher  likelihood  of conviction,  and  a higher  penalty.  But why do  such disparities exist?  Conventional  explanations  point  to  differences  among  sovereigns' legal  rules,  resources, and dockets.  These understandings,  while  valid,  neglect to  account  for  a less  tangible  source of federal  criminal  power:  legitimacy.  ""Legitimacy""  refers  to  the  concept,  refined  through  decades of empirical  research,  that  citizens  comply with  the law,  and  defer  to  and  cooperate with  legal authority,  when  they  perceive  both  the  laws  and  the  authorities  to  be  fair.  A  legitimacy-based exploration  of the federal  criminal justice  system  significantly  enriches our understanding  of the sources  of  federal  criminal enforcement  power.  Distilling those  sources, moreover, reveals surprising and counterintuitive implications:  to  emulate  the  sources  of federal legitimacy  in local systems,  we need more localized criminal justice.",cover,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf

"Police officers in the United  States have killed over 1000 civilians each  year since  2013. The constitutional landscape  that  regulates  these  encounters defaults to the  judgments of  the reasonable police officer at  the time of  a civilian encounter based  on the officer's  assessment  of  whether threats to their  safety or the safety of  others requires  deadly  force. As many of  these killings have begun to  occur under similar circumstances, scholars have  renewed a contentious debate on  whether police disproportionately  use deadly force against  African Americans and  other  nonwhite civilians  and whether such killings reflect racial bias.  We  analyze data on 3933 killings to examine this intersection of  race  and reasonableness  in  police killings. First, we describe  the objective circumstances and interactions  of  police killings and map those event characteristics  to  the elements of  reasonableness  articulated  in case law. Second,  we assess whether inherently vague constitutional  regulation  of lethal  force is applied  differently by  officers depending on the civilian's  race, giving rise to  a disproportionate rate of deaths among racial  and ethnic minority groups.  We  then  assess the prospects  for  remediation  of  racialized police killings  by testing  the effects of  an existing evidence-based training curricula designed to  reduce police  use  of deadly  force towards  persons experiencing  mental illness.",cover,Fagan and Campbell - 2020 - Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings Symposium Beyond Bad Apples Exploring the Legal Determi.pdf

"I'm  kind of a glass-is-half-empty kind of person,  and Frank's book  gives  me reason  to  be that way  when it comes to criminal justice reform. Although more than half the states have lowered their incarceration rates, which  is good, sixteen  states report an increase  in  the  number  of  prisoners  in 2016 as  compared  to 2007.5 Moreover,  if we look at the states that have lowered their prison  populations,  that decrease  is  actually pretty small when you compare it to  the prison buildup that took place before that. There  was  an increase  of seventy-seven  percent  between 1972 and 1981, but the  decrease,  from 2007 to 2016, was only about seven  percent. 6 So  that's an  eleven-to-one  differential. So  the glass is actually eleven-twelfths empty. The overall decrease was really driven by outliers  like  California,  which was responsible for  reducing  the number  of prisoners-and  I'm getting  a  lot  of these  stats  from  Frank's draft-by  almost  44,000  people. 7 The other forty-nine states combined reduced it only by 38,000.8 This is just to give you an outline about how this is not a story of largescale change  happening everywhere.",cover,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf
"Changes in social conditions have rendered this application of strict liability rare. Unlike the state of nature, modern social relations involve contractual webs governing myriad kinds of risky behaviors. And when individuals are not mutually cooperating in this way, they engage in a variety of other kinds of social interactions in which they regularly occupy the roles of both a right-holder and a duty-bearer. 183 As reciprocally situated duty-bearers, rightholders incur the costs of compensatory obligations they are owed. The fair protection of right-holder interests under these conditions limits purely compensatory forms of strict liability to nonreciprocal dangers above the communal background level of reasonable risk. This compensatory rule of strict liability, therefore, applies to the same kinds of social interactions as it did in the state of nature. The primary difference is that modern social interactions hardly ever involve these kinds of objectively defined nonreciprocal risks; they are 'abnormally dangerous activities.' 184",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The Sixth Circuit majority (from which Judge Nalbandian dissented on this issue) otherwise had a more constrained view of the Tax Power injury. 243 The court explained that before the Treasury's final rule, the Offset Provision's constraint of Kentucky and Tennessee's 'sovereign authority to tax . . . sufficed for standing.' 244 However, after the final rule, the states no longer had Tax Power standing because they failed to identify a 'specific course of conduct' that would lead to recoupment. 245 The court reasoned that the final rule 'subsequently disavowed the States' interpretation of the Offset Provision,' leaving them with an outdated fear of losing the CSLFRF. 246 The court reached a similar conclusion in Ohio v. Yellen : Ohio suffered no injury from the mere 'subjective chill' the Offset Provision had on its taxing authority. 247 Likewise, the Eighth Circuit held that where there was no imminent threat to Missouri's 'constitutional right to set taxes,' there was no Tax Power injury. 248",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Many  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law  include  some  elements  of what  is  elsewhere  called proportionality  analysis.  I argue  here for greater  use  of  proportionality  principles  and doctrine;  I also  argue  that  proportionality  review  is  not  the  answer  to  all  constitutional  rights  questions. Free  speech  can benefit  from categorical  presumptions,  but in their application  and design proportionality  may be  relevant.  The  Fourth Amendment,  which  secures  a  ""right""  against  ""unreasonable  searches  and  seizures,""  is  replete with  categorical  rules  protecting  police  conduct from judicial  review; more  case-by-case  analysis  of the  ""unreasonableness"" or  disproportionality  of police conduct would better protect rights and the rule of  law.  ""Disparate impact"" equality  claims might be  better  addressed  through  more proportionate  review standards;  Eighth  Amendment review  of  prison sentences  would benefit from  more use  of  proportionality  principles.  Recognizing  proportionality's advantages,  and  limits,  would  better  enable  U.S.  constitutional  law to  at once protect rights and facilitate effective  democratic self-governance.",cover,Jackson - 2014 - Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality.pdf

"This data does not show that there currently is too much liability. Today, any significant mismatch between average wealth and average tort verdicts only threatens bankruptcy in the average case, a prospect that enables tortfeasors to offer liability insurance as their only source of injury compensation. 238 Bankruptcy makes it easier to justify more extensive liability, all else being equal, which in this instance can help justify a significant mismatch between average wealth and average tort awards to equitably prevent the irreparable injury of physical harm.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"In her excellent book, Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution  and End Mass Incarceration, Emily Bazelon'  uses  the stories of  two  individuals  to  showcase  the  enormous  power  prosecutors  have  in  a criminal  case.  The  use  of these  narratives  makes  the  book  both  a  gripping read and a valuable  primer for understanding how important local  prosecutors  are  to the way punishment  operates  in America.  Showing  the authority prosecutors  have over  most aspects  of punishment  in America  is  the book's central  descriptive  contribution.  But  the  book  has  a  normative  agenda  as well. Bazelon argues that those seeking to  dismantle  mass  incarceration should  recognize  that the  power  of  prosecutors  can  be  an effective lever  of reform.  She argues that by electing  prosecutors concerned  about mass  incarceration, we  can start to shift course  away  from tough-on-crime  rhetoric that in  reality does  a poor job keeping  people  safe  and move  toward policies  that actually  work.  I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  Bazelon's descriptive  claim  that prosecutors are critical actors-probably the most important actor,  if we had to  choose  just  one-in  administering  criminal justice  policy  in  America.  I also  agree  that we  would  do  well  as  voters  to  select  prosecutors  who  understand what really works  to  fight  crime  and therefore  know that mass  incarceration is  not  the answer.  Electing  prosecutors  committed  to  decarceration is  an  improvement  over  the  status quo,  and  it  should be  a  vital part  of any reform agenda.",cover,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf

"To test whether the physical-harm requirement implements such a 'worst goes first' equitable maxim, we can consider its established exceptions. As courts have recognized, the 'physical injury rule is not a shibboleth to be honored without understanding its purpose and origin . . . . In applying the physical injury rule, it is important to consider why the rule exists and whether these purposes are at work in this case.' 242 Consequently, when the purposes or rationales for the physical-harm requirement 'are weak or absent,' the Restatement (Third) of Torts observes that courts are willing to 'recognize duties of care' in cases of pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional harm. 243 The question, then, is whether courts depart from the requirement of physical harm when doing so would not violate the equitable principle, 'the worst should go first.' If so, this basic limitation of negligence liability provides another important example of how compensatory resource scarcity factors into substantive tort law as a matter of principle.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

United States' held  that  pretextual  traffic stops  do  not  violate  the Fourth  Amendment,  the  Court  made the  reasonableness of  the stop contingent  only on the police officer's actions  rather than the motivations driving these actions. 2 Rendering officer motivation constitutionally irrelevant  and  thus  removing  the  real  reasons  for  police  searches  and seizures  from  constitutional  scrutiny  engendered  a  swarm  of criticism that condemned the decision's many vices.  These critics have emphasized the pervasive  and overreaching effects of condoning pretexts  in policing. 3 They  decry  the  unbounded  discretion  pretexts  give officers, 4 as  well  as the  disproportionate  enforcement  against  people  of color.'

"For decades,  legal  commentators  sounded the  alarm  about the tremendous  power wielded by prosecutors. Scholars went so  far as to identify  uncurbed  prosecutorial discretion  as  the primary  source  of  the criminal justice  system's many  flaws. Over  the  past  two  years, however,  the conversation  shifted.  With  the emergence of  a new wave of  ""progressive prosecutors,"" scholars  increasingly  hail  broad prosecutorial discretion  as  a promising mechanism for  criminal justice reform.",cover,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf

"This  Article  critiques  the  ""progressive  prosecutor""  movement  as  a  vehicle  for serious change  in  the  criminal  legal system  and  argues that  fully  resourcing defenders  is a far better strategy.' The progressive prosecutor movement has  generated  significant  political, professional,  media,  and  academic attention  in  recent years  with hyperbolic  claims that progressive  prosecutors  will ""end mass  incarceration  and restore  fairness to the criminal  system 'without  changing a  single law.""' In the movement's most ambitious form, progressive prosecutors are cast as having the  power  to  transform  the  criminal  legal system  into  a  true  justice  system. 3 Embracing this  trend,  several prosecutors  in recent  years  have branded themselves explicitly in their political identities  as  some form of progressive  prosecutor. 4",cover,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf

"A grounding  in abolitionist demands  highlights the failure  of conventional modes  of  reform  to  mitigate the  scale of  state  and  market  violence and exploitation. 4 Developing  alternate  horizons  and  frameworks  is  essential  to advancing  demands  that  make  possible  the  political,  economic,  and social transformation that  so  many  of  us  deem  necessary. As  movements  have popularized prison abolition as a framework for wholesale transformation,  others have coopted  the language  of abolition to  continue  to push conventional  reform agendas. This  Article lays  out  a  framework  for  radical  reforms rooted  in abolitionist organizing and then considers specific reforms through the framework.",cover,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf

"Since  the Ferguson and Baltimore uprisings, legal scholarship has  undergone  a  profound  reckoning  with  police violence.  The emerging structural  account of police violence  recognizes that it is routine, legal,  takes many shapes,  and targets people based on  their race,  class,  and gender.  But  legal  scholarship remains fixated  on investing in the police to repair  and relegitimize their social  function without  paying sufficient  attention  to alternate frameworks  for reform. The  2020  uprisings sparked by  the  police killing of George Floyd mobilized  demands  rooted  in  prison  abolitionist organizing  that provide another  way forward. In contrast  to conventional reform,  the calls  to defund and  dismantle  the police confront  head-on the violence, scale, and power of the police,  and therefore aim to  redress police violence  by  diminishing the  scale,  scope,  and legitimacy of police function.  These  calls are an important aspect of a practical  agenda aimed  at  eliminating prisons  and police  and  building  modes  of collective care and social provision where  reform  is one  essential strategy.",cover,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf

"For example, a tort obligation to install airbags in a reasonably designed automobile will prompt the manufacturer to increase the vehicle's price to cover that cost. Likewise, the vehicle's price will cover the manufacturer's other liability costs, including those of injury compensation. The equilibrium contract price in a market based on the normatively justified set of entitlements accordingly embodies the full cost of the tort obligation. Because consumer right-holders fully pay for the correlative tort obligations of manufacturer duty-bearers, liability can be excessive by unreasonably burdening the legally protected interests of these right-holders via increased prices.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Anexclusive focus on the defendant's interests only implicates the defendant's unreasonable exercise of liberty. The defendant negligently caused all these foreseeable harms, and insolvency would not lead to debtor's prison. An unreasonable liberty interest is not plausibly prioritized over the conflicting interests of foreseeable accident victims, whether those interests involve physical security or economic harms. Like the now outdated concern about culpability, the defendant's interests do not provide a principled justification for substantively limiting the tort duty to fend off bankruptcy.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Though largely incoherent, there are consistent, basic principles within the Supreme Court's standing jurisprudence. Among other things, a plaintiff in federal court must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury-infact. 28 The Offset Provision cases considered whether the states met that requirement. At times, state plaintiffs have survived Article III scrutiny by alleging unique injuries via a 'special solicitude' that courts have drawn from their sovereign status. 29 But nearly two decades after Massachusetts v.

"This compensatory norm of strict liability was first embodied in the early common-law rule that 'a man acts at his peril,' which, according to Holmes, 'seems' to have been 'adopted by some of the greatest common-law authorities.' 167 The 'peril' of risky conduct resides in the obligation to compensate the ensuing injuries, regardless of fault. To be clear, this principle, as Holmes quickly pointed out, is not correctly specified. The common law limits liability to foreseeable harms; liability does not extend to all the causally related harms flowing from one's acts. 168 Foreseeability is a necessary condition for making",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"This  Article  unearths the pernicious  effects  of pretextual  policing  on civil  rights and democratic principles. The  Fourth  Amendment's  pretext doctrine has faced widespread  criticism  for enabling  police to  shield the  real reasons  for  searches  and  seizures  from  constitutional  scrutiny.  In  its  ruling on Whren v. United  States, the Supreme  Court established that police  actions, not their motivations, are the relevant factor in determining the constitutionality of  searches and seizures. As a result, police can  use ostensibly legal  justifications  as  a  cover  for  unconstitutional  conduct.  This Article  breaks new  ground by arguing  that pretextual  policing  extends beyond searches  and  seizures.  It  reveals  a  broader  alarming  phenomenon  in which police  use  existing  laws as  a  pretext  to  avoid  accountability  and  expand  the state's carceral  power.",cover,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf

Following the transition from the state of nature, the newly emergent state enforced legal obligations with ordinary money for paying taxes and the like. 12 By utilizing ordinary money as a form of social currency for enforcing legal obligations within the realm of injury compensation, the common law imbued the monetary damages remedy with a duality of normative meaning that persists to this day-it is both crassly commercial and a normative measure of fair compensation.

"Like compensatory damages, punitive damage awards are issued in ordinary money and are also subject to the inherently limited ways in which that medium of exchange can fairly redress wrongdoing. After all, if money were sufficient for retributive purposes, wealthy individuals could intentionally kill or sexually attack others and buy their way out of responsibility by paying monetary damages. These kinds of retributive problems create a complementary role for criminal liability, explaining why 'punitive or exemplary damages have been assessed . . . upon evidence of such [willfulness], recklessness or wickedness, on the part of the party at fault, as amounted to criminality.'

As a fiduciary, the government was under an express obligation to affirmatively protect this right.

Consider, for  example,  the  oft-quoted passage  from Berger  v.  United  States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935): ""[The prosecution's interest] is  not  that it shall win a  case, but  that justice shall be done ...

"This Part proposes an easily administrable way for courts to conduct more meaningful judicial review of law enforcement secrecy claims: assess threshold claims by reference to law enforcement's own pre-dispute conduct. Courts should demand to know the conditions that law enforcement previously imposed on access to the allegedly privileged information. Were recipients required to sign a nondisclosure agreement? If so, what were the terms? Was access revoked or information returned at the close of each investigation? Where and how was the information stored? Was access supervised, logged, or required to occur at a secure, monitored location? The answers to these questions reveal law enforcement's own tolerance for leaks and should thus establish a transparency floor: At a minimum, if the court can impose protective-order safeguards that match or exceed what law enforcement previously required, then disclosure does not significantly increase the risk of the secret getting out. In those circumstances, judges should have no qualms about denying the privilege and ordering disclosure.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Scholars  view  prosecutors as ""the most powerful  officials  in the criminal justice system,""' and blame  them  for ""[m]uch  of what is  wrong with American criminal justice."" 2 But there is  typically something  missing  from  the accounts. An  abundant literature highlights  the failings  of the nation's prosecutors. 3  Yet when  it comes  to setting out principles to govern  how prosecutors should act, the commentary offers  only platitudes. 4 A  1935  Supreme  Court opinion  famously reminds prosecutors  that it is  their special duty to  ensure  ""that  justice  shall  be done."" 5 After  that, the  consensus crumbles. Despite  all  the  attention paid  to prosecutors  in recent years,  the  primary guidance  on the prosecutorial function remains  a timeworn Rorschach test. 6",cover,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf

From 1900 to 1950, the GDP per capita in the United States increased from $4,096 to $9,573 measured in constant 1990 international dollars; by 1992 it had further increased to $21,558 (approximately $52,817 in current dollars). 127 Consumption patterns changed accordingly. 'By comparison with the conveniences and comforts widely available in developed economies at the end of the 20th century, everyday life two centuries ago was most akin to what we know today as 'camping out.' ' 128 With the financial capacity to improve living conditions beyond the bare necessities, individuals had discretionary income to acquire other kinds of goods and services characteristic of modern life's conveniences and comforts. The increased social wealth made it possible for tort law to normatively distinguish between one's physical security and another's conflicting liberty interest involving the expenditure of financial resources.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"After identifying the relevant noncontroversial tort principles, Part I explains why courts can defensibly consider matters like insolvency and liability insurance when formulating substantive tort doctrine. To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a 'social currency' that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injurycausing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"Under conditions of perfect compensation, tort liability cannot be justified with deterrence reasoning. A duty-bearer who acts tortiously can fully repair any wrongfully caused injuries through the payment of perfectly compensatory damages, eliminating any reason to deter injury-causing behavior. To be clear, deterrence can be an incidental consequence of a duty insofar as duty-bearers choose to comply with the legal obligation when they would not otherwise act in this way absent such a duty. But deterrence does not justify a tort duty or the imposition of liability in a world of perfect injury compensation.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Particularly do we need to be dispassionate and courageous in those cases which deal with so-called ""subversive activities."" They are dangerous to civil liberty because the prosecutor has no definite standards to determine what constitutes a ""subversive activity,"" such as we have for murder or larceny. Activities which seem benevolent and helpful to wage earners, persons on relief, or those who are disadvantaged in the struggle for existence may be regarded as ""subversive"" by those whose property interests might be burdened or affected thereby.

"At its core, standing is rooted in separation-of-powers concerns. 95 Standing circumscribes 'what activities are appropriate' for Article III courts, an 'irreducible constitutional minimum' for when a federal judge can grant jurisdiction and get involved. 96 A court must refuse to resolve even a potentially meritorious claim if the plaintiff is 'not properly situated to be entitled to its judicial determination.' 97 As then-Judge Scalia phrased it in his influential article on the subject, standing 'is an answer to the very first question that is sometimes rudely asked when one person complains of another's actions: 'What's it to you?'

"Our Supreme Court  squarely  confronted the  issue  whether  a corrupt agreement had to  be alleged and  proven  to  support a charge  of  nonfeasance and,  if not, whether  a quasi-judicial officer, such  as  a county  prosecutor, could  be liable for nonfeasance  for failure to  perform  discretionary acts. The Court  concluded  that nonfeasance  required mens rea but  not  a corrupt motive. In  other words,  nonfeasance was alleged where it was said  that the  defendant  ""willfully or  corruptly"" refused to  fulfill his duties. It was not  necessary  that some motive  of  personal gain  or  favoritism be shown.  It was enough that the  refusal was willful and  for no valid reason, e.g., in  bad faith. The Court  agreed that  the  prosecutor was  a quasi-judicial officer endowed  with discretion, but  found that a standard of  good faith would not  unduly  obstruct him in  the  performance of  his office. Rather,  the Court  noted that  the  publichad a right  to expect  care, skill, diligence, reason  and  judgment  by  a prosecutor.",cover,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf

(I  should  make clear  that Pasquale  himself is  more nuanced,  calling for a  discussion  of the kinds of transparency we  should demand;  he asks: ""How much  does the black box firm have to reveal?  To whom must it reveal it?  And  how  fast . . . ?"" (p.  142).)  Even  a  transparent,  facially  neutral  algorithm  can  still produce  discriminatory  results. 9 What we need instead  is  a transparency  of inputs and  results, which  allows  us to see that the algorithm is",cover,Chander - 2016 - The Racist Algorithm 2017 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf

"A B  S  T  R A C T. Bail  reform is gaining momentum  nationwide.  Reformers  aspire to  untether pretrial detention  from wealth  (the  ability to post money bail)  and condition it instead on statistical risk,  particularly the  risk that a defendant will commit crime if he remains at liberty pending trial. The bail reform movement holds tremendous promise, but it also forces the criminal justice system to confront a difficult question: what statistical risk that a person will commit future crime justifies short-term  detention -if any does? What about lesser restraints on liberty,  like GPS monitoring? Although the turn to actuarial  risk assessment  in the pretrial context has  raised  concern in some quarters,  the debate  so far has largely ignored this foundational question.",cover,Mayson - 2017 - Dangerous Defendants.pdf

"killings. Our  findings suggest  that the standards in constitutional case law  fail to  anticipate  the  circumstances of  fatal police shootings  and are therefore seemingly irrelevant  in  preventing racial  disparities in  police fatal police shootings. In light of this constitutional landscape, we argue that the ineffectiveness  of enhanced police training  to  reduce  shootings  overall  and racial  disparity within these  shootings may reflect the  absence of  race-specific components in  their  curricula. We suggest that the addition  of training components  that specifically address the  role of  race in officers 'perceptions  of risk and  their  decision-making in potentially dangerous interactions  with citizens  may remediate  both the incidence ofpolice shootings and their apparent racial and ethnic disparity.",cover,Fagan and Campbell - 2020 - Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings Symposium Beyond Bad Apples Exploring the Legal Determi.pdf

The social currency perfectly substitutes for the victim's lost bodily integrity in the relevant normative sense, thereby erasing any inherent normative difference between the victim's physical-security interest and the injurer's conflicting liberty interest.

"A principled categorical evaluation of duty is still governed by the normative calculus of tort law. The principle of formal equality obligates courts to equally account for the conflicting interests of both right-holders and dutybearers. In a negligence case, the normative calculus of reasonable care asks whether the defendant failed to take a safety precaution and incur the associated burden on liberty that was reasonable in light of the reduced threat or risk to the plaintiff's interest in physical security. 39 The underlying normative problem-the fair way to balance conflicting interpersonal interests in liberty and security-does not disappear when courts address the antecedent question of whether the defendant owed a duty of care. As applied to the element of duty, the normative calculus is simply reoriented from the individual case to the general category of cases the duty governs, thereby enabling courts to consider normatively relevant facts beyond those in the case at hand.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Once a loss has already occurred, 'whatever benefit might be derived from repairing the fortunes of one person is exactly offset by the harm caused through taking that amount away from another.' Id. at 4. Consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff's impaired interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm. In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. 'Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.' Id. These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff's protected, injured interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner. The burden of proof then maintains the integrity of this priority. The plaintiff must prove the elements of the prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence. When the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.

When the Reed episode took place, the Office of the Legislative Counsel was a fledgling drafting office. 17 What was it doing advising Reed on the constitutionality of pending legislation? And why should Reed have cared what the Office had to say? Scholars have dismissed the Office's pre-1970s influence, characterizing it as weak and inconsequential. 18 The existing literature has no answer to the influence on display in the Reed incident. And the neglected historical record shows that this was no isolated incident: this Office wielded an uncanny ability to convince lawmakers that even their own legislation had to be abandoned as unconstitutional. 19",body_text,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

"Once again, an adequate analysis of the tort problem implicates the scarcity of compensatory resources-in this instance, involving the compensatory resources of right-holders rather than duty-bearers. As a matter of principle, judges are supposed 'to enforce . . . rights up to the point at which enforcementceases to be in the interests of those the rights are supposed to protect.' 171 Tort law cannot justifiably enforce a compensatory right when doing so would ultimately work to the net detriment of the right-holders who are supposed to be compensated.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"There  are  several methods  for holding prosecutors accountable in  this country. Judges  enforce a few legal boundaries on  the  work of  prosecutors, and  legislatures sometimes have their say about criminal  law enforcement. Prosecutors with positions lower  in  the  office or  department hierarchy must answer  to  those  at  the top.  As licensed attorneys, prosecutors must  answer  to  the  bar  authorities in  their states. But  none of  these controls binds  a  prosecutor too  tightly. At  the  end of the day, the  public  guards against abusive  prosecutors through  direct democratic control.

"More  specifically,  the  apparent  doctrine  forming  the  overcriminalization canon  has two  components.  The  Court  begins  by  identifying  two  disconnects: that  between  a  statute's narrow-sounding  title  and extremely  broad language  in specific  provisions,  and  that between  the  common,  man-on-the-street  meaning of a  phrase  and the  government's proposed  reading  of it. The  Court then  uses these disconnects  to find ambiguity  in a key term,  even if the term is defined by the  statute  (as  in Bond) 1 0 or  the  term  is  frequently  used  and  interpreted  as a legal  term  of  art (as in Yates). 11",cover,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf

"Once again, accounting for the general availability of compensatory resources sheds new light on tort law's development. 'The prevailing view of American tort history regards nineteenth-century tort doctrine as deliberately structured to accommodate the economic interests of emerging industry.' 124 The associated claim that courts limited liability to 'subsidize' the newly industrializing economy is hard to square with available evidence. 125 The foregoing analysis provides additional historical reasons for rejecting the subsidy thesis. By limiting liability to avoid depressing economic development, courts could defensibly rely on the associated concern of ensuring that individuals would have the financial ability to maintain their physical health. The lack of social wealth in this era largely eliminated the normative difference between one's security interest and another's conflicting liberty interest chiefly concerned about survival. This reason of principle justified extensive rules of 'no liability.'",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"'The focal point of the fairness consideration expressed in the disproportionality constraint is on the injurers' perspective, taking account of the elementary moral principle that the punishment should fit the crime.' 231 Negligent misconduct is not ordinarily a crime, but the otherwise puzzling invocation of the proportionality principle applicable to criminal punishment becomes defensible once one accounts for the associated problems of insolvency and debtor's prison: Sending someone to prison for failing to satisfy a tort debt involving economic loss or stand-alone emotional harm would be disproportionate punishment for ordinary, noncriminal negligence.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"In this Article, I  consider the contemporary law reform project of a  radical  social movement  seeking to  transform the state: specifically, that of the  Movement for Black Lives as articulated  in its policy platform ""A  Vision for Black Lives: Policy Demands  for Black Power,  Freedom, and  Justice."" The Movement for Black Lives is  the leading  example of a contemporary racial justice movement with an intersectional politics including feminist and anti-capitalist  commitments.  The  visions of such radical  social movements offer  an alternative  epistemology for understanding and addressing  structural  inequality. By studying not only the critiques  offered  by radical social movements,  but also  their visions for  transformative change,  the edges of law scholarship  can be expanded,  a deeper  set of critiques  and a longer  set of histories-of  colonialism and settler colonialism, the Atlantic slave  trade and mass incarceration-centered, and a bolder project of transformation  forwarded. These visions should  push legal scholars  toward a broader  frame  for understanding how law,  the market, and the state co-produce intersectional  structural  inequality, and toward agendas that  focus not on building  the power of  law and  the police, but on  building the power of marginalized communities and transforming the state. This shift would invigorate the social movement's literature  and bring new  energy to scholarship  on substantive areas of law, from criminal  and immigration law to property and contract law.",cover,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf

"The outcome of this compensatory exchange is captured by Arthur Ripstein's interpretation of the modern compensatory damages remedy in tort cases as involving 'a normative claim about the relation between wrongdoing and repair.' 61 Onthis normative account of injury compensation, 'the sole rationale for granting damages at all-for bringing the coercive and cumbrous machinery of the state to bear on a particular defendant to require him to compensate the plaintiff he has injured-is the respect in which damages make it as if the wrong had never happened.' 62 The wrongdoing or debt is cancelled, ending the matter.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Robinson emphasizes both the comprehensiveness  and the  clarity of criminal codes'  descriptions of  prohibited conduct,  on the ground that clearly  defined crimes  send better signals  to  the public  at large  than ambiguously  defined  crimes.

"propriate at all, judges should demand to know the conditions that law enforcement itself previously imposed on access to the putatively secret information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will serve as a signal for the value of secrecy. If law enforcement has not taken sufficient care with the information, courts should default to denying privilege. Second , even when the government can cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should still be possible in many cases to accommodate defense access.

"ABSTRACT. Proportionality, accepted as a general principle of  constitutional law by many countries,  requires that government intrusions  on freedoms  be justified,  that greater intrusions  have  stronger justifications,  and  that punishments  reflect  the  relative  severity  of the  offense.  Proportionality  as  a  doctrine  developed  by  courts,  as  in  Canada, has  provided  a  stable methodological  framework,  promoting structured,  transparent  decisions  even  about closely contested  constitutional  values.  Other benefits  of proportionality  include  its  potential  to  bring constitutional  law closer to constitutional justice,  to provide  a common  discourse about rights for all branches  of government,  and to help identify the kinds of failures  in democratic  process warranting heightened judicial  scrutiny. Earlier U.S.  debates  over  ""balancing"" were  not informed by recent comparative  experience with structured proportionality  doctrine and its benefits.",cover,Jackson - 2014 - Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality.pdf
"This Article has explained how the law enforcement privilege can obstruct police accountability and lead to wrongful convictions while acknowledging that, in some cases, it serves important policy goals in effective investigative methods. The Article teased out what minimal rules exist to cabin the privilege in current federal appellate doctrine and identified a core problem with those rules: In a subtle conceptual collapse, courts are mistakenly using the privilege's policy rationale as the test for assessing threshold claims to privilege. That rationale is too vague to create a meaningful constraint.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"The contractual approach also requires negotiating parties to agree to the insertion of these provisions. It is difficult to imagine a state that is not interested in confirming its ability to comply with its international human rights obligations. But as noted above, certain countries are predominantly home to claimants; accordingly, these states may have different incentives and interests to vindicate than states that serve as repeat respondents. 111 Nonetheless, claimant home states are still periodically targets of ISDS. For example, Canadian investors brought a claim against the United States, seeking $15 billion for denying the permits necessary to build the Keystone Pipeline. 112 Aside from the fact that all countries have an obligation to their citizenry to protect its human rights, all countries have an incentive to protect the exercise of their sovereignty.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"Over time, the criminal law became the exclusive province of the state, leaving the victims of crime with a tort claim for monetary compensation. The rise of punitive damages within tort law then became the injury victim's surrogate to obtain retribution for reprehensible misconduct that the compensatory damages remedy could not adequately redress. But unlike its counterpart in the state of nature, the punitive remedy is embodied in an award of monetary damages. This tort remedy enables an injured victim to exact financial revenge without engaging in any violence-a civilized attribute of the tort remedy which gained further value as the market economy developed. The only wayto punish a corporate wrongdoer-the cause of widespread injury in modern society-is by inflicting financial pain through a tort award of punitive damages.

"This Article has offered an alternative 'circumstantial evidence' rationale for confidentiality requirements that applies as easily to topical as to communications privileges: A privilege claimant's pre-dispute conduct concerning the confidentiality of information offers circumstantial evidence of the value of keeping that information secret. The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information. None of this reasoning need be limited to the law enforcement privilege alone.

"The  overcriminalization canon  is  triggered  when  the  government  prosecutes  an individual  for a  single  act (or course  of conduct)  under a criminal  statute  whose  main  purpose  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  defendant's  conduct,  yet which  contains  broadly  worded  provisions  with  words  that,  read  literally, encompass  it. The  canon  applies  when  the government  is  demanding  years  of incarceration  for  a  far-from-deadly criminal  act:  either  it is  piling  on,  adding  a federal  charge  when  traditionally  a  state  one  would  suffice,  or  it is  criminalizing  what  would normally  be  a  civil  infraction. The  canon  effects  a  broadening of the usual  statutory  analysis,  allowing the  defendant to overcome  text that appears  unambiguous  on its face, and imposes  some  sort of heightened  burden  on the  government,  requiring  it to  prove  that Congress  really  meant to  criminalize the  conduct  at issue  through the  particular  statute. 9",cover,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf
"There are other mechanisms that an agency can use to engage the public in the rulemaking process. However, courts generally treat these mechanisms as add-ons, rather than as alternatives to notice and comment. Some scholars have proposed using the committees authorized by the Federal Advisory Committee Act to mitigate the problems associated with notice and comment. However, such an approach is (1) unlikely to hold up against an APA legal challenge and (2) subject to many of the same issues as the notice-and-comment process. FACA 'governs the process whereby the President or an administrative agency obtains advice from groups that include one or more nonfederal employees.' 32 The Act provides a framework for how such groups can be formed and specifies requirements (ranging from regularity to attendance and outcomes) for a federal advisory committee's meetings. 33 FACA's requirements include procedural hurdles-such as mandatory consultation with the General Services Administration and ethics requirements for committee members. 34 FACA's formality often burdens the use of federal advisory committees with the same procedural challenges as notice and comment without addressing the transparency and accessibility issues created by both processes. 35",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"Part II turns to the unwritten rules that cement discovery's failures for those plaintiffs who do access the process, relying on case research and dozens of interviews with formerly incarcerated people, federal magistrate and district judges, staff attorneys, civil-rights lawyers, and prison officials. 59 This Part begins by outlining the predictable evidentiary needs undergirding most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims. These needs are not inherently harder to fulfill in the prison context; the problem instead lies in the practical constraints hindering the process. Security concerns make a significant share of relevant evidence simply undiscoverable. And since prisons control the creation and storage of most evidence-surveillance footage, written incident reports, and the likenegligence or ill will can mean the disappearance of (or the failure ever to produce) vital information. Resource restrictions make valuable discovery tools like depositions and expert reports inaccessible to imprisoned litigants, shutting off any real hope of poking holes in a defendant's story or proving a doctor's indifference to a medical condition. And hostility between incarcerated people and their jailers breeds distrust, foot-dragging, and credible allegations of spoliation. Together, these difficulties are different in both degree and kind from those faced by other pro se litigants and civil-rights plaintiffs. The Article thus draws the unavoidable conclusion that the aspirationally transsubstantive Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wholly disserve prison litigation. Without unique intervention, no meaningful opportunity exists for incarcerated plaintiffs to evidence their claims. Through this lens, the Article contributes to ongoing efforts to distinguish law in theory from law in practice 60 and joins a mounting chorus of",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis

"For instance, in United States v. Clements , a federal district court denied a criminal defendant access to an executable copy of a surveillance software program for testing after the government opposed the defendant's discovery motion by asserting the law enforcement privilege.

"Given this history, the basic worry is that the law enforcement privilege will be used to conceal too much. For instance, courts have declined to categorically refute claims that the privilege shields the type of batteries used in an audio recording device, 131 or 'the charts, graphs, and raw data' generated during a polygraph examination. 132 Shielding this type of information from adversarial scrutiny can enable tragic misconduct. Consider that, in July 2023, the Third Circuit found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a detective fabricated polygraph evidence, which led to an innocent man's wrongful eleven-year prison sentence. 133 A privilege sweeping enough to encompass polygraph data can prevent that type of misconduct from ever coming to light. Yet critics have complained that courts 'apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,' 134 and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion. 135",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Abstract. In misdemeanor  cases,  pretrial  detention poses  a particular problem because  it may induce innocent defendants to  plead guilty  in order to  exit jail, potentially  creating widespread  error  in  case  adjudication.  While  practitioners  have  long  recognized this possibility, empirical  evidence on  the  downstream  impacts  of  pretrial  detention  on misdemeanor defendants and their cases  remains limited. This Article uses  detailed data on hundreds of thousands of misdemeanor cases resolved  in Harris County, Texas-the thirdlargest  county  in the United  States-to  measure the effects  of pretrial detention  on  case outcomes  and future crime.  We find that detained defendants  are 25% more likely  than similarly situated releasees  to plead guilty,  are 43% more likely  to be  sentenced  to jail, and receive  jail sentences  that are  more  than twice  as  long  on  average.  Furthermore, those detained pretrial are more likely  to  commit future crimes, which  suggests  that detention may have  a criminogenic  effect.  These  differences  persist even after fully  controlling  for the initial bail amount, offense, demographic information, and criminal history characteristics.  Use  of more  limited sets  of  controls,  as  in  prior research,  overstates  the adverse impacts of detention. A quasi-experimental analysis  based on case timing confirms that these  differences likely reflect  the  causal  effect of  detention.  These  results  raise important constitutional  questions and suggest  that Harris  County  could  save millions  of dollars  per  year,  increase  public  safety,  and  reduce  wrongful  convictions with  better pretrial release policy.",cover,Heaton et al. - 2017 - The Downstream Consequences of Misdemeanor Pretrial Detention.pdf

"For example, Arthur Ripstein defends the corrective-justice interpretation on the ground that compensatory damages as a normative matter 'make it as if the wrong had never happened.' 146 His reasoning is straightforward: 'Although few people would be indifferent between being free of injury and being injured and receiving compensation, adequate compensation can enable a person to have (almost) the same range of options.' 147 Compensatory damages adequately correct for the injustice, eliminating the prevention of bodily injury as a principled concern of substantive tort law. As Ernest Weinrib puts it, '[f]or corrective justice, deterrence plays no role in defining the nature of the wrong.' 148",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"Federal  prosecutors wield enormous power.  They  have the  authority to make charging decisions, enter  cooperation agreements, accept  pleas, and often dictate sentences or sentencing ranges.  There are currently no  effective  legal checks  in  place  to  police the  manner in which  prosecutors exercise  their discretion. As  a result,  in the  current era dominated by pleas instead of  trials, federal  prosecutors  are not merely law enforcers. They are the  final  adjudicators in  the  95%  of cases  that are not  tried before  a federal  judge  or jury.  In  a government whose hallmark  is supposed to be the separation  of  powers, federal prosecutors are a glaring  and dangerous exception.  They have the  authority  to take away liberty, yet  they are often  the  final  judges in their  own cases. One need not be  an  expert in separation-of-powers theory to know  that combining these powers in a single actor  can lead  to gross abuses. Indeed, the combination  of  law enforcement and  adjudicative  power  in a single  prosecutor  is the most significant design flaw  in  the  federal  criminal  system. Although  scholars  have  made persuasive cases  for greater external controls on prosecutors, these  calls for reform  are  unrealistic in  the  current political climate.  The  solution  must  be sought elsewhere.",cover,Barkow - 2008 - Institutional Design and the Policing of Prosecutors Lessons from Administrative Law.pdf

The  Arizona  Legislature  has adopted  a law that requires the Attorney General to investigate  local laws at the request of any  state  legislator and  withhold  state  funds  where  a  local  law  conflicts with  state  law. 6 Michigan  adopted  legislation  that  bars  local  governments from  regulating  paid  sick  days,  wages, scheduling,  and  hours  or  benefits disputes.' In North  Carolina, the  state  legislature  adopted  a  ""bathroom bill"" that was  designed  to  strike  down  local transgender  civil  rights  ordinances. 8 Before  it  was  repealed,  the  same  law  also  preempted  municipal  minimum wage, contracting,  employment  discrimination,  and public-accommodations ordinances. 9",cover,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf

"Part I explores the written rules governing prison litigation, including the scant few bearing on discovery. It begins by surveying the impoverished legal options available to those who wish to resist the harsh conditions of their confinement in federal court. The barriers are twofold: many of prison's indignities simply lie outside the scope of federal causes of action, and for those few who can locate a cognizable claim, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)-a 1996 law aimed at stemming frivolous prison litigation-makes its vindication nearly impossible, imposing procedural hurdles at litigation's earliest phases. 58 Most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims thus fail before discovery even begins. For the few cases that emerge, effective discovery is of vital importance: having survived the PLRA's hurdles, these are the cases that everyone agrees could well be nonfrivolous-ample reason they be properly evidenced and heard. For these cases, discovery promises fairness, exposure, and regulation sorely needed in the carceral context. But written, prison-specific discovery rules are few, far between, and",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis

It explains that  there are  crucial differences between administrative  and criminal matters  when  it comes  to  the separation of  powers. Maintaining the separation of  powers in criminal matters has strong roots  in the Constitution's  text and  structure. Moreover, unlike the administrative law context,  where agencies must adhere to  the structural and  procedural protections of the Administrative  Procedure Act  and their decisions  are  subject  to judicial review and political oversight, the  government  faces  almost  no  institutional checks  when  it proceeds  in criminal matters.

"Lucas 's focus on state-specific law for defining background principles was consistent with the Court's understanding throughout most of the twentieth century that the word 'property' in the Fifth Amendment had no inherent federal meaning. 73 During this period, the Court adhered to the notion that the Constitution references property rights, but that those rights are generally created and defined by state law. 74 As the Court explained in Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth , 75 '[p]roperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.' 76 Professor Stewart Sterk traces this reliance on state law (as opposed to general law) as far back as Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon 77 the first case to recognize a regulatory taking. 78 Pennsylvania Coal , Sterk argues, emphasized state law's importance for regulatory takings analysis by identifying specific property interests enshrined in state common law and legislation. 79 And by the late twentieth century, the Supreme Court routinely relied on state law to define property rights in cases challenging actions by state governments. 80 By 'defer[ring] to",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"To  the  extent  Bazelon  and I  diverge,  it is  only  about  how  optimistic we should  be  about  this  movement  transforming  the  landscape. 2 Bazelon believes  that ""[t]he  movement  to  elect  a  new  kind of  prosecutor  is  the  most promising  means  of reform . .. on  the political  landscape"" (p.  296).  Bazelon could well  be right, but for that to happen, these progressive  prosecutors will have  to  successfully achieve  key institutional  reforms. Critically,  that  includes  imposing  real  checks  on prosecutors  themselves  (reform-minded or otherwise).  Indeed,  a  key  metric  for  identifying  whether  a  prosecutor  is,  in fact,  a real reformer,  as  opposed to  someone  who  is just seeking  a convenient label  as  a  progressive,  is  whether  or not  they  are  actively  pursuing reforms that limit the leverage  they have in  criminal cases,  such as  seeking  the  elimination  of  mandatory  minimum  sentences, promoting  open-file discovery laws,  pursuing the  end  of  cash bail  and the  dramatic curtailment  of pretrial detention,  accepting limits  on their use of state-prison  resources,  pushing for judicial  discretion  in sentencing,  advocating  for  robust second  looks  of  sentences  by  actors  other  than  prosecutors,  and  downsizing  their offices. For these  prosecutors to  achieve  real  reform, they will  need  not  only to  advocate for  these  positions but also  to  help  achieve  their realization-and that is  no small  task given  the  entrenched  opposition  to  all  of these  ideas,  including from prosecutors within their own  offices.",cover,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf

"There is a most important reason why the prosecutor should have, as nearly as possible, a detached and impartial view of all groups in his community. Law enforcement is not automatic. It isn't blind. One of the greatest difficulties of the position of prosecutor is that he must pick his cases, because no prosecutor can even investigate all of the cases in which he receives complaints. If the Department of Justice were to make even a pretense of reaching every probable violation of federal law, ten times its present staff would be inadequate. We know that no local police force can strictly enforce the traffic laws, or it would arrest half the driving population on any given morning. What every prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.",cover,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf

I  don't know  if you'll remember  this,  Frank, but  it's in  my  mind  quite clearly. I was in awe.  It was  a panel at Columbia Law  School, I hadn't been in teaching for very long,  and I was  going to be on a panel  with him. I was explaining  the thesis of my paper,  which was an argument that fiscal changes in the states were  going to bring about bigger sentencing changes,  and analyzing why they wouldn't happen at the federal level because they weren't suffering from the  same kind of cost constraints  and the politics  were different. 2 I gave my presentation, and then, when it was Frank's turn,  he  said  that I was  practicing  social  science  without  a  license.  So,  Frank, I remain  an  unlicensed  social  science  driver, but I have  nevertheless  been  asked  to  take the  wheel  again  to comment  on both  your  book  and,  I  hope,  mine.  Thankfully  for me, you do all the hard  social science work in your draft and end up  backing  up  observations  that I make  in  my  own  book,  in which I use more  political  economy  and some  of the politics  and existing  research  and  data  that's out  there  on  mass  incarceration.

Even if someone decides to act tortiously and is willing to pay compensatory damages for having done so, that payment is perfectly compensatory and makes the plaintiff normatively whole.

Furthermore, when negotiating newgeneration IIAs, states may consider imposing reciprocal obligations on investors, especially as they concern the protection of human and environmental rights. 102 To act as a fiduciary is to act affirmatively as a protector and only in the best interest of one's beneficiaries.

The democratization movement, this Article argues, rests on conceptually problematic and empirically dubious premises about the makeup, preferences, and independence of local 'communities.' It relies on the proudly counterintuitive claim that laypeople are largely lenient and egalitarian, contrary to a wealth of social scientific evidence. And ultimately, democratization's dual commitments are on a collision course.

"1 . Levels of Generality. Baker and Slaybaugh illustrate that the general law approach, because it is fundamentally an exercise in abstraction, can result in more expansive background limitations on property rights (and therefore less property protection). A familiar theme in constitutional law is that as a principle's level of generality increases, so too do the number of particular cases that it covers. 167 In the background principles context, increased abstraction can mean more limitations on property interests and less Takings Clause protection. That general law background principles would be more abstract than statespecific ones is intuitive: When courts attempt to analyze the laws of jurisdictions in times and places near and far, a higher level of generality is needed to make those disparate laws all cognizable as part of a single, all-encompassing background principle. In Baker , for example, the necessity exception was distilled into a highly general rule that left the meaning of 'emergency' and 'necessity' the principle's two key",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"Economics literature helps to explain the significance of such costs. According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"abstract. Each day, the news brings stories of military attacks on schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, electrical facilities, and other critical civilian infrastructure. The militaries attacking these objects often seek to justify the attacks by claiming that the civilian objects are being used by militants. Objects that are believed to have both military and civilian use are often referred to as 'dual-use' objects. Even though the term has become common, international law does not recognize a 'dual-use' object as a legally meaningful category. Rather, the postwar Geneva Conventions that lie at the core of modern international humanitarian law establish a bright line between 'military objectives' that are considered legitimate targets of military force, and civilians and 'civilian objects, ' which are to be strictly protected.",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War

In the Bronx, New York City, a holistic defense provider (the Bronx Defenders) and a traditional defender (the Legal Aid Society) operate side-byside within the same court system, with case assignment determined quasi-randomly based on court shift timing. Using administrative data covering over half a million cases and a quasi-experimental research design, we estimate the causal effect of holistic defense on case outcomes and future offending. Holistic defense does not affect conviction rates, but it reduces the likelihood of a custodial sentence by 16 % and expected sentence length by 24 %.

"The current doctrine's vagueness makes this conundrum worse. Federal appellate case law simply reiterates the privilege's policy rationale as the test for asserting threshold claims and, consequently, imposes virtually no meaningful constraint on law enforcement's secrecy power. The policy rationale supposedly motivating the privilege-that disclosure of investigative methods would risk countermeasures-could theoretically apply to almost any investigative technique. Vagueness invites law enforcement to overclaim the privilege, whether to conceal mistakes and negligence, to hide unlawful and unconstitutional conduct, or simply to avoid the hassle and inconvenience of having investigative methods challenged in court. As one federal judge opined, '[i]n a society where government is supposed to be open, where it is supposed to be the servant of and responsive to the people . . . does it make sense for courts to create a body of privilege doctrine that sweeps so broadly[?]' 279",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Mass comments are just one way organizations might use technology to take advantage of the notice-and-comment system. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence tools, this phenomenon could worsen in the coming years. For example, a group (or an individual, for that matter) could ask ChatGPT to produce 3,000 comments 55 that substantively address the same concern about a rule but appear facially distinct. An agency would have to read those 3,000 comments more closely than mass email campaign comments since the AI-generated comments would not be identical, creating an even bigger drain on the agency's time and resources. If someone spreads out the submission of these comments, it makes it even harder for the agency to be sure that it is not passing over a substantive comment somewhere in the mix: The agency must read every comment to ensure nothing of cogent materiality goes overlooked.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"The obsessive focus  on removal  as  the  touchstone of  independence  is curious because  insulation from the  President is  often not  the  dominant  reason  why policy makers  seek  to  create independent agencies in  the  first place. Rather, the  goal  of  insulation is  frequently to  allow  an  agency  to  protect the diffuse interest of  the  general public or  a vulnerable segment  of  the  public that, because  of  collective action problems  or  resource limitations, is  often outgunned  in  the  political process by well-financed and  politically influential special interests. The insulated agency,  its designers hope,  will better resist short-term partisan pressures and instead place  more emphasis  on empirical facts that will serve  the  public interest in  the long  term.  Put  another way,  the creation of  an independent  agency is  often  motivated by a concern with agency  capture.",cover,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf

"Such is the case for the state. Sovereign power derives from a diffuse population but must be exercised and operationalized by a governmental entity. A government may, in theory, run the same risks of an agency problem as a corporate board. Government officials can have interests that differ from the citizenry that they represent-they could be courted by lobbyists, have financial stakes in certain industries, or have political aspirations such that they use their governing power to act in ways that are not to their constituency's direct benefit. The constraint of fiduciary duties is thus as applicable to the state as it is to the corporation.

"The fiduciary theory can help clarify what constitutes a legitimate expectation for investors. Human rights are just as much a part of a host state's legal framework as any other international obligation, as they come from the same sources: treaties, jus cogens , and customary international law. 128 First, investors must identify existing human rights obligations when performing their due diligence. Second, they must understand the state's role in protecting human rights.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"Furthermore, states should not have standing based on the subject matter of the federal regulation alone. Both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits appear to treat the subject matter of the Offset Provision, which implicates a state's ability to create and cut taxes, as a plus factor in finding standing. 277 Although the Fifth Circuit did not discuss the Tax Power injury directly, its reasoning on the merits is also troubling on this front, as anytime Congress 'require[s] the States to accept policy changes, [it] triggers the [Spending Clause's] coercion analysis.' 278 This rule is unworkable for standing: Standing should not be based on whether the spending condition at issue touches something 'too sovereign-y' because that standard provides judges too much unfettered discretion.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Although packaging a theory of human rights prioritization in private law concepts may lead to wider adoption by arbitrators, other actors may not readily embrace the fiduciary theory due to the current ad hoc system's incentives. This is not to say that the theory is without value. As mentioned earlier, ISDS and international investment law are weathering a legitimacy crisis. 179 Some scholars and practitioners believe that the remedy to this crisis is to reform the constituent treaties; a viewpoint into which the contractual approach falls. 180 Others advocate for an arbitral process-based approach.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"property into 'a second-class right.'' 175 In other individual rights contexts, the burden typically falls on the government to point to a historical analogue that justifies a regulation burdening constitutional rights. 176 By contrast, both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits placed the burden on the respective plaintiffs to show a 'historical or contemporary authority that involves facts close[] to those at bar and where the petitioner succeeded under the Takings Clause.' 177 This burden's origin is unclear. Perhaps it stems naturally from the fact that background principles are antecedent to the takings analysis, such that the burden falls on the plaintiff to establish that they had a property interest in the first place. More cynically, it could be the result of the courts' squeamishness toward making definitive statements about history in these cases, so as to preserve 'flexibility' for future cases, 178 conceal operative normative judgments, 179 or avoid getting the answer wrong. 180 On this understanding, background rules would only appear categorical, but judges would exercise discretion in individual cases to determine whether a plaintiff's showing of history is 'close enough.' In any case, by burdening plaintiffs to disprove the applicability of background limitations instead of requiring the government to prove a necessity defense these early general law cases demonstrate a bias that undercuts property protections.",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property
"Relative rights regularly create interpersonal conflicts. Individuals have a relative right to physical security, just like they have a relative right to liberty. Each right gives legal protection to an identifiable interest-one's interest in physical security, and the other's interest in the exercise of liberty. To equitably resolve conflicts between these two relative rights, tort law must fairly balance or mediate the conflicting interpersonal interests of the two interacting parties. Consequently, the 'history of the law of torts has centred around the search for an adjustment between two basic interests of individuals-the interest in security and the interest in freedom of action.' 19",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

To believe that we can both work toward fundamental change while simultaneously engaging in incremental reform efforts requires that we identify what reforms move us toward transformational change, or at least those that do not move us away from it.",cover,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf
"Part IV shows how these two problems of resource scarcity have influenced substantive tort doctrine. The relevant tort principles are not the products of any particular rationale for tort liability, such as allocative efficiency or corrective justice. They instead are embedded within the normative calculus that courts necessarily and openly apply when developing substantive tort law in a principled manner. Social facts involving the general availability of compensatory resources, including the spread of liability insurance, factor into this normative calculus in ways that predictably shape substantive tort law's reach, causing it to either contract or expand.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"That clarification did not deter the states, which pursued litigation anyway. Following its final rule, the Treasury argued that the state plaintiffs lacked standing for a pre-enforcement injunction. Specifically, the Treasury argued that because the states had not alleged a course of conduct that would violate the final rule's interpretation of the Offset Provision, the states faced no imminent injury as required by Article III. 61 This and the Treasury's other arguments have yielded mixed results. 62 For the first time, federal courts had to answer the question: When do states have standing to challenge under the Spending Clause?",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Whatever  else  one might think about  prosecutors, it is generally believed  that they hold the power to right the  wrongs  of our criminal justice system.  For  example,  while  discussing  a  political  action  committee  (PAC) created  to  help reform-minded  prosecutors  win elections,  the  activist  Shaun King commented:  ""No position in America,  no single individual has a bigger impact  on  the  criminal  justice  system-including  police  brutality,  but  the whole  crisis of  mass incarceration in  general-than  your  local district attorney . . . . They  are  the gatekeepers of  America's justice system.""

"More  specifically,  the  apparent  doctrine  forming  the  overcriminalization canon  has two  components.  The  Court  begins  by  identifying  two  disconnects: that  between  a  statute's narrow-sounding  title  and extremely  broad language  in specific  provisions,  and  that between  the  common,  man-on-the-street  meaning of a  phrase  and the  government's proposed  reading  of it. The  Court then  uses these disconnects  to find ambiguity  in a key term,  even if the term is defined by the  statute  (as  in Bond) 1 0 or  the  term  is  frequently  used  and  interpreted  as a legal  term  of  art (as in Yates). 11",cover,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf

"Nonetheless, states should have Spending Contract standing in some cases. Federal courts should be available to serve as 'mediators' when states face actual coercion to ensure a healthy federalism. 258 The best way to achieve this balance of federalism and the separation of powers is to look to Spending Clause jurisprudence. In cases like Dole and Sebelius , there was no question that states had standing to sue given the legislation's immediate obligations. 259 There, the federal offers required legislation from the states-you don't get this money unless you raise the legal drinking age. 260 The states had to undertake immediate and definite compliance as a condition of receiving the money and risked losing existing federal funds if they failed to comply. 261 In such cases that require near-immediate action for money, states would not be able to complete the required act if Congress's expectations were ambiguous, or they would be unfairly forced to act if the bargaining was coercive or ambiguous. States have Spending Contract standing in these cases to challenge potentially ambiguous or coercive offers.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing
"This compensatory ideal poses an evident problem for tort law's method of compensating bodily injuries. The fundamental tort problem centers on the equitable mediation, balancing, or 'adjustment between two basic interests of individuals-the interest in security and the interest in freedom of action.' 44 In the event of liability, the defendant's subordinate liberty interest is legally responsible for harming the plaintiff's prioritized security interest. Due to the normative difference between these two conflicting interests, a perfectly compensatory currency for redressing the plaintiff's injury must be socially constructed to equitably burden the defendant's liberty interest by an amount that completely redresses the plaintiff's bodily injury. How can the defendant's paid compensation be a full and perfect equivalent for the plaintiff's bodily injury?",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"This  Article  undertakes  that effort.  It offers  a  fresh  look  at  the  causes  of forum disparities  in street  crimes,  an alternative  framework  for  understanding them, and  a  new  agenda  for  inquiry. These  disparities manifest  not  just differences  in  legal  rules  and resource  allocations  but  also  how actors  within the respective criminal justice systems-primarily witnesses, juries, and judges -perceive the  system's legitimacy.  Exploring  forum disparities  through the  lens  of legitimacy  enriches  our  understanding  of the  sources  of federal criminal power. And the policymaking implications are surprising and counterintuitive:  by distilling the sources  of  federal  legitimacy,  we see the need for more localized criminal justice.",cover,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf

"* Mary A. Lynch,  Kate Stoneman  Chair in Law and Democracy,  Albany Law  School. In 1993,  Professor Lynch founded a postconviction clinic in which Albany Law students and she  represented incarcerated survivors of intimate partner and family  violence  who fought back against their abusers. It is not surprising  given  intersectional burdens that  almost  all of  their incarcerated clients  were Black,  Hispanic,  or  Native  Women.  One  of their clients, intimate partner survivor,  Charline Brundidge,  was  the first New  York  State  recipient of gubernatorial  clemency  for  killing  her abusive  partner.  For  the  past  twenty years,  Lynch has  directed  the  Domestic Violence  Prosecution  Hybrid  (DVPH)  Clinic  at Albany  Law  in which  students  work  on domestic  violence and  sexual assault  cases. Lynch  has  been engaged  with anti-violence  work and coordinated community  response  to  intimate partner violence throughout this  time.",cover,Lynch - 2020 - Building an Anti-Racist Prosecutorial System Observations from Teaching a Domestic Violence Prosecu.pdf

"Arrests  are  more  than  the  point  of entry  into  the  criminal justice  system. They  also drive a host of other decisions.  A  number of actors outside the criminal  justice  system,  such  as  immigration  enforcement  officials,  public  housing authorities,  public  benefits  administrators,  employers,  licensing  authorities,  social  services providers,  and education  officials,  among others, routinely  receive and  review arrest information.  These  actors  use arrest information  for their own purposes  and in ways  that are distinct  from the aims  of  the  criminal justice system.  Arrests  now serve  as  a significant source  of regulation,  separate  and apart from  their role in the  criminal justice system.",cover,Jain - 2015 - Arrests as Regulation.pdf

He  was charged  in 16 counts with  having  knowledge of  the  operation of disorderly houses  where gambling  operations were maintained. It  was alleged  that he unlawfully and willfully neglected  to  perform  his  duty  to  use all proper  and lawful means to  detect, arrest, indict, and convict those responsible, despite the  fact  that he had sufficient men  and resources to  do so.  In  the  final three counts of  the  indictment, the  defendant was charged  with  unlawfully and  willfully failing to  use  lawful  means at his  disposal to  detect, arrest and prosecute certain police officials about  whom  he had received reports of  corruption.

"110. Little Sisters , 140 S. Ct. at 2374. The Court here describes the good cause exception as it applies to IFRs because those are the rules that HHS promulgated in this case. Nothing else in the opinion would suggest that they do not also view the good cause exception as providing the same leeway to an agency to promulgate a non-interim final rule without notice and comment. The Court's offhand characterization here of the good cause exception stands in direct contrast to the Ninth Circuit's staunch distaste for it in Riverbend Farms, Inc. v.

"The civil  rights community celebrated  this development,  which came on the heels  of officers  in other jurisdictions being  cleared  of any wrongdoing for killing black men. 1 3 Mosby was lauded  for wielding her  position  as  the  city's chief  prosecutor  to  insist  on  police  accountability. 1 4 Mosby  herself  seemed  to  have  anticipated  this  support. At  the  press conference  announcing  the  charges,  she  spoke  directly  to  the  protestors when she assured:  ""I  heard your  calls  for  'no justice,  no  peace!"" 15 But things did  not go  according to  plan. In  a rousing  press  conference  after the first three  of  the  officers  were  acquitted,  Mosby  announced  that she was professionally  compelled  to drop  the  charges  against  the  remaining three officers  despite the horrific injustice. 16 She decried  the trouble  and pain  ""mothers  and  fathers  all  across  this  country,  specifically  Freddie Gray's mother Gloria Darden,  or  Richard  Shipley,  Freddie  Gray's stepfather,  [go]  through  on  a  daily  basis  knowing  their  son's mere  decision to run  from  the  police  proved  to  be  a  lethal  one.""""

"The Article begins in  Part I  by identifying the  main reasons why policy makers seek  to  create  independent agencies  in  the  first place, highlighting that a  concern  with  agency  capture and lopsided partisan and interest group pressure has  been  a  driving force. Part II  then  explores the  traditional factors associated with  independent agencies.  Removal protection for  agency  heads is  the  touchstone, but  independent agencies are  also  typically characterized by their multimember structure and  the  fact that, unlike executive agencies, they  do  not have  to  submit  cost-benefit analyses of proposed  rules for review by the  President's Office  of  Information and Regulatory Affairs. Part II  explains the  relationship between  these  traditional characteristics and the  goal of  limiting capture and one-sided political pressure. Part III then  goes  beyond  the  conventional mechanisms to  address additional design  features that have largely gone under  the  radar of  administrative law scholarship. These features are  an  agency's funding  source; qualifications for appointment  and post-employment  restrictions for  agency officials; the  agency's relationship with  other federal agencies; the  agency's relationship with  state-level actors; and various political tools, including the  agency's ability to  generate politically powerful  information, its ability to  recruit political benefactors, and  the potential for public advocates to  become part of  the agency  structure. Part III argues  that  these  factors, deemed  ""equalizing factors,"" are more  robust checks  against agency capture under  asymmetrical political conditions than the  use  of traditional factors alone.",cover,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf

The term is hard  to define in part  because its adherents embrace a diverse set of  policies and  priorities. In comparing the contemporary  movement with Progressive  Era prosecutors, this  Article has two related  goals. First, it seeks to better  define progressive prosecution. Second,  it uses  a historical  comparison to  draw some  lessons for the  current  movement.  Both groups of  prosecutors  were elected on  a  wave of  popular  support. Unlike today's  mainstream prosecutors  who tend to campaign  and  labor  in relative obscurity, these two sets  of  prosecutors  received a good  deal of  popular attention  and support. The Progressive  Era reformers introduced  the  notion  promoted by  current progressive  prosecutors  that  crime is a social  phenomenon, which community  services  are  better  equipped  to  address  than prisons.  The Progressive  Era  movement also sought  to implement  professional  norms and practices to promote the values of  fairness and  proportionality. Contemporary  progressive prosecutors inherit this legacy  but tend not to emphasize these  professional  values. The Article  concludes that  the professional  values championed  during the Progressive  Era  are critical, in conjunction with new programs and  policies,  to  ensure that as innovation",cover,Green and Roiphe - 2020 - When Prosecutors Politick Progressive Law Enforcers Then and Now Criminal Law.pdf

"In yet one more respect, then, the problem of scarce compensatory resources alters the normative calculus of tort law in a predictable way that conventional tort theories have not recognized. Like duty-bearers, right-holders do not have unlimited compensatory resources and accordingly have a reasonable interest in minimizing their injury compensation costs. For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder's total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrencebased liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"As Holmes also famously demonstrated, tort law employs a default rule of negligence liability, not strict liability. 169 Once again, this structural feature of tort law can be squared with compensatory rules of strict liability. To equitably prevent bodily injuries and other irreparable harms, the baseline negligence rule prioritizes the right-holder's security interest over the duty-bearer's conflicting liberty interest. This same priority justifies supplemental compensatory rules of strict liability: The fact of injury to the right-holder's prioritized security interest creates a compensatory obligation for the duty-bearer's conflicting, subordinate liberty interest, regardless of whether the exercise of liberty was reasonable. 'So understood, important areas of strict liability involve the same sort of judgments about the importance of various liberty and security interests as does the fault system.' 170",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

In  fact, under  modern conditions of  political oversight, other design elements and  mechanisms are  often just as  important to  an  agency's ability to  achieve its long-term mission relatively free from capture. This  is  particularly true of agencies tasked with  protecting the  interests of  politically powerless groups, including the  dispersed general public, where  the  political pressure to  rule for more powerful, organized interests will be  intense and  one-sided. 6",cover,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf

The discussion so far has shown that compensatory resources are scarce in part because no amount of money can fully repair a lost life or a badly injured body. The other primary reason for the scarcity of compensatory resources stems from the social fact that defendants often do not have enough financial assets to satisfy a tort judgment-the problem of insolvency.,body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Of greatest significance to the Offset Provision cases (and most Spending Clause litigation) are the second and 'fifth' prongs of this test: Congress's conditions must be unambiguous, and it may not unduly coerce the states. As articulated in Pennhurst v. Halderman , courts evaluate the second prong according to the 'clear notice' canon of statutory interpretation. 75 The solution is not for courts to entirely strike down ambiguous provisions. 76 Instead, when interpreting relevant spending conditions, a court must fill the shoes of the funds' recipient (here, a state) at the time it chose to accept the deal and ask whether the state 'would clearly understand' its statutory obligations and liabilities. 77 The spending condition is still enforced but in a way that the states could have fairly anticipated. The Court's clear notice rule for the second prong helps facilitate federalism by ensuring the spending conditions are enforced in unsurprising ways.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"As discussed earlier, arbitrators often hesitate to extinguish obligations owed to investors when considering a state's human rights obligations. 137 The contractual and judicial approaches are thus only as effective as arbitrators allow them to be. As seen in Eco Oro , a treaty provision can be interpreted narrowly and in seeming contradiction to its plain meaning and purpose. 138 The effectiveness of interpretive tools such as article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 139 further depends on the willingness of a tribunal to recognize both that (a) human rights obligations constitute rules, and (b) that they are relevant to the present dispute. 140 Even when a tribunal acknowledges a human right's existence, as observed in Suez , 141 a tribunal may still enforce conflicting obligations owed to an investor. An integral part of the solution is to reshape internationally shared norms by advancing theoretical frameworks, such as the fiduciary theory, through which more robust human rights protections can be justified.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The Court disagreed, holding Massachusetts's asserted injury-that 'rising seas' would 'swallow Massachusetts' coastal land'-was sufficiently concrete and particularized for standing. 122 Although the Court did credit the proprietary, non-sovereign ramifications of coastal flooding vis-a-vis Massachusetts as a landowner, 123 Justice Stevens's majority opinion also factored Massachusetts's status as a state into the Court's standing analysis. 124 Distinguishing previous environmental cases where private plaintiffs lacked standing, Stevens asserted that 'States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.' 125 Because the states 'surrender[ed] certain sovereign prerogatives' to the federal government when they entered the Union, they are 'entitled to special solicitude in [the Court's] standing analysis.' 126 A bare majority thereafter held that Massachusetts had standing and ruled for the state on the merits-four justices dissented. 127",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"At  the  same  time, however, lawyers outside the  office sometimes expressed skepticism about  whether  its traditions were being  adequately maintained. Indeed, in the  eyes  of a  former prosecutor from any  generation, it was almost axiomatic that the  office began  to  go downhill on  the  very day  that the particular lawyer left it for private practice. Of  course, there were  good  reasons for someone  viewing the  office with  detachment (or, as  in  the  case  of a  defense lawyer, from  the  other side) to  be  skeptical. As important as  the  concept of ""doing justice"" may have  been, there have  always  been  cross-cutting themes  in  the prosecutor's office. Most  significantly, there was a  tradition of machismo,  of the prosecutor as  aggressive trial lawyer facing  down the  lawbreaking adversary. As  Jerry Lynch  has  noted, this was a tradition which  Bill Tendy,  the  quintessential tough-talking prosecutor, embodied  more than anyone. 2",cover,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf

"The source of the  duty  was  never identified, however.  Thus, what might  be accepted by many as  an  article of faith might  be viewed skeptically by  some.  Nor, for that matter, was  the duty  ever precisely defined. The  concept was  protean as  well as  vague.  It  assumed  different meanings  in  different contexts, meanings  that one  could  only infer. One incarnation related to  our  exercise of discretion -how to  decide, for example, whether to  charge a  guilty individual or  defer prosecution, or  what  terms  of a  plea  bargain should be  acceptable. In  this context, ""doing justice"" meant  seeking to  achieve a ""just,"" and  not  necessarily the  most  harsh, result. In  the  trial context, the concept seemed  to  mean something else, however.  It  had  something to  do  with fidelity tothe fairness of the process -the  idea that, if the trial was a  fair one,  then even  when the  jury acquitted a  defendant whom  we were  convinced was guilty, justice was done.  Sometimes the  concept was implicit in  the  way a  senior lawyer worked  through a  hard question with  a  new  prosecutor: What,  she  might ask, was  the right  hing to  do? For  those who were  believers, doing justice was an animating principle; it was  the  office's life blood, often silent, unseen, taken  for granted.",cover,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf

"Many  actors get  involved in  criminal law enforcement, and  the  public uses  a mix of  devices to  control those actors. Take the  police, for example. There  was a time  when  political patronage systems  built into local government  controlled the work  of police, with some  peripheral support  from tort  doctrines and state procedural rules. 5 Over  time, however,  legal doctrine and  legal institutions became more important in  the effort to  hold the  police accountable for their choices. In  the latter half of  the  twentieth century, the  federal constitution became a  more potent source  of  limits on the  police, and other  legal doctrines and legal  institutions reinforced the  trend. 6 Today,  limits on  the  work of  police officers derive from  the federal  constitution, state  constitutions, statutes, ordinances, judicial rules  of criminal  procedure, internal departmental regulations, and various  other  legal sources. 7 Electoral accountability still matters in  the  work of  the  police; sheriffs are  typically elected, and police chiefs are  among the  most  visible and important",cover,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf

"This Article  thus  brings to  light  new  constitutional concerns with pretextual policing and  calls for  a  reexamination of  its constitutionality beyond  the  Fourth  Amendment.  It  highlights  how  the  expansion  of pretext imperils civil rights and democratic principles, including separation of powers.  By exploiting the constitutional  irrelevance  of pretextual  motivations, police undermine  free  speech,  access  to  information,  and due process  rights that  empower  individuals  to  scrutinize  and  hold  state  actors accountable. Ultimately,  this Article raises  the  stakes of an already  controversial  doctrine",cover,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf

"Substantive  criminal  law  defines  the  conduct  that  the  state  punishes.  Or does it?  If the  answer is yes,  it should be possible, by reading criminal codes  (perhaps  with a few  case annotations  thrown in),  to tell what conduct will land you in prison.  Most discussions  of criminal  law, whether  in  law  reviews,  law  school  classrooms,  or  the  popular  press, proceed  on  the  premise  that  the  answer is yes. 1 Law  reform  movements  regularly  seek  to  broaden  or  narrow  the  scope  of  some  set  of criminal liability rules,  always on  the assumption  that by  doing so they will  broaden  or narrow  the  range  of behavior  that is  punished.  Opponents  of these movements  operate  on the  same assumption -that  the law determines  who goes to prison  and  who doesn't, that  the  distribution of criminal punishment  tracks criminal law as it is defined by code books  and  case  reports.  Of  course,  participants  in  these  debates  understand  that  the  law  does  not by  itself determine  who  is  and  isn't punished.  Some  criminals  evade detection,  police and prosecutors  frequently  decline  to  arrest  or  charge,  and  juries  sometimes refuse  to convict.  Still,  if  the  literature  on  criminal  law  is  an accurate  gauge,  all that  is just  a gloss on  the  basic  picture,  a modification  but  not  a negation of the claim that criminal law drives criminal punishment.",cover,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf
"An actor is justified in responding to the immediate threat or the infliction of violence or confinement with necessary and proportional force. It is both unrealistic and unfair to ask someone who is suddenly and wrongfully attacked to be content with the possibility of a subsequent tort lawsuit against, or criminal prosecution of, the assailant. 134",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The state-plaintiffs' central argument in the Offset Provision cases was that the Provision exceeded Congress's power under the Spending Clause. 63 In short, the states argued that the Offset Provision was unconstitutionally ambiguous and unconstitutionally coercive. 64 Understanding how these constitutional limits manifested as the necessary sovereign injuries for standing purposes requires a brief explanation of the Spending Clause.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"I was sitting in that room. It was  the first time that I had heard anyone  argue that reforming  police would not stop the violence-that the only way to decrease police  violence  was  to  decrease  the  number  of police.  For  at  least  a  decade, scholars  had  debated  approaches  to  decarceration, 3 but few  had  considered the possibility of  shrinking  the  police. Many  championed  the  reforms  Herzing dismissed.  But Herzing convinced  me  then that the  violence  and scale of police were  fundamentally  intertwined with  that of incarceration.  For those  opposed to mass criminalization, Herzing's  framework  left  one option: to  shrink  both prisons  and police.",cover,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf

"During the era when insolvent tort defendants faced imprisonment, any formulation of a tort duty that would involve a considerable risk of insolvency necessarily implicated debtor's prison-a severe deprivation of liberty for those subject to the tort duty. Insolvency further threatened premature death in the unforgiving conditions of debtor's prison. All else being equal, this normative burden made it harder to justify tort duties. 215",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"For some arrested individuals,  the most  important consequences of  their  arrest  arise  outside the criminal  justice  system.  Arrests  alone-regardless of  whether they result in conviction-can  lead to a  range of  consequences,  including deportation, eviction, license  suspension, custody disruption, or adverse employment  actions. But  even as courts,  scholars,  and others  have  drawn  needed attention to  the civil consequences of  criminal  convictions,  they have paid  relatively little  attention  to  the consequences  of  arrests  in their  own right. This Article aims to  fill  that  gap  by providing an account of  how arrests  are  systemically used outside the criminal  justice system.  Noncriminal  justice actors who  rely on  arrests-such as immigration  enforcement officials, public housing authorities,  employers,  licensing authorities, and  child  protective service  providers, among others-routinely  receive and use arrest information  for their own  objectives. They do so not because arrests  are the best regulatory tools but  because  they regard arrests as proxies  for information they value,  and  because arrests  are often  easy and inexpensive  to  access.  But  when  noncriminal  justice  actors  rely  on  arrests, they  set  off a complicated  and  poorly  understood  web  of interactions with  the criminal  justice system.  Regulatory bodies and others that make decisions based on  arrests  can coordinate  and  pool resources with prosecutors  and  police  officers, achieving  a level of  enforcement that neither  could  achieve  alone, or  they  can make decisions  that undermine important  aspects of  the criminal justice  process. This Article maps different  regulatory interactions based on  arrests and illustrates the need  for  greater  oversight over how arrests  are  used  and  disseminated outside the criminal justice system.",cover,Jain - 2015 - Arrests as Regulation.pdf

"With this framework in mind, the fiduciary theory will influence tribunals less focused on public policy in their consideration of human rights obligations. Arbitrators do not need to guess at the ideal policy outcomes when balancing a domestic population's human rights against an investor's rights. Instead, the legal framework is clear. The state, as a fiduciary, has no ability to contract away the power to protect its population. Any interpretation to the contrary invalidates the agreement due to breach of the fiduciary duty. So long as a human rights interest is identified, this duty-obligation defense is accessible to the state. Just as a domestic commercial arbitrator or judge can identify breaches of fiduciary duties in corporate disputes, an international investment arbitrator is equally capable.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The answer to this problem is simple: Courts should use law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct regarding the confidentiality of the information as circumstantial evidence of an acceptable risk of leaks. Courts should demand to know how law enforcement previously treated the allegedly privileged information. As an initial matter, if law enforcement failed to take reasonable care before coming to court, then in most cases judges should be able to avoid the difficult task of digging further and simply default to ordering disclosure. Second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access. Here is a simple procedure to do so. Courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford. If judges can craft a protective order that matches or exceeds the protections that law enforcement previously imposed, then ordering disclosure would not create a significant new risk of leaks and courts should, once again, default to ordering disclosure.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"The exact method or test for balancing conflicting interests turns on the fundamental rationale for tort liability. For example, courts could balance conflicting interpersonal interests in security and liberty by reference to an underlying principle of substantive equality that gives everyone an equal right to selfdetermination or autonomy. This type of balancing would require courts to determine the relative importance of the conflicting security and liberty interests for individuals to lead a life of their own choosing. Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare. Exactly how a tort rule balances one conflicting interest over another within the normative calculus of tort law depends on the highly contestable requirement of substantive equality and its implications for the nature of tort liability. 25",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The reason is that American criminal  law, federal and  state, is very broad;  it  covers  far more  conduct  than  any jurisdiction could  possibly punish. The  federal  code  alone  has  thousands of criminal  prohibitions covering  an  enormous  range  of  behavior,  from  the  heinous  to  the trivial.  State  codes  are  a  little  narrower,  but  not  much.  And  federal and  state  codes  alike  are  filled  with  overlapping  crimes,  such  that  a single criminal  incident typically violates  a half dozen or more  prohibitions. Lax  double jeopardy  doctrine  generally  permits the  government to charge  all  these  violations rather  than  selecting  among them.  Since all change  in  criminal  law  seems  to  push in  the  same  direction -toward more liability -this state  of affairs  is  growing worse: legislatures regularly  add  to  criminal  codes,  but  rarely  subtract  from  them.

"The discussion so far has shown why the scarcity of compensatory resources places deterrence at the center of tort law. Negligence is the liability default rule for good reason, strongly pulling tort law theories in that direction. A deterrence rationale for strict liability is complementary and comfortably fits within this conceptual framework. But by making deterrence and conductbased liability rules so vitally important, the problem of scarce compensatory resources masks the extent to which tort law is based on a compensatory norm.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"For  decades, law  faculty  have  dismissed  demands  to  divest  from  and dismantle  the  police  as  fringe  and unworkable.  Then  came  the  2020  uprisings following  the  police murder of George  Floyd in Minneapolis,  among the largest social  movement mobilizations in U.S. history. 4 The nationwide  protests catapulted  prison  and police  abolition  into  the  mainstream  and,  in  the  process, unsettled the  intellectual foundations of liberal police reform efforts. 5",cover,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf

"* J.D. Candidate, May 2026, University of Michigan Law School. Thank you to Professor Nicholas Bagley and Professor Nina Mendelson for their invaluable feedback on this Note and my ideas. This Note would not be possible without the smart and thoughtful edits from the Vol. 124 Notes Office: Luke Pomrenke, Haley Rogers, Dustin Smith, Ruben Piñuelas, Jacob León, and Suji Kim. I would not be here without the support (read: willingness to listen to me rant about niche admin law musings at all hours) of Heather Foster, Henry Evans, Nathan Pitock, Daniel Kaylor, and Madeline Guth, as well as my mom, my dad, and my sister. Finally, although the views expressed in this publication do not reflect those of anyone else who worked at the U.S. Department of Commerce during my time there, I would not have made it to Michigan Law, let alone published this piece, without the brilliant minds I met in the Biden Administration, most of all former Deputy Secretary Don Graves.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

It is the only approach of the three that does not rely entirely on either the state or an arbitral tribunal. As critical stakeholders in the system, investors are just as able as states and arbitrators to influence norms, the main thrust of the atmospheric approach.

"A B ST  RA CT. Scholars and reformers  have in recent years  begun to imagine new  and different configurations  for  how the  state  can  design policing  institutions.  These conversations  have  increased  in volume and  urgency in response to the 2020 national  uprising against police  violence, when radical  demands  born within  social  movements  have  gained  steam-demands  to  defund the police, to  institute  ""people's budgets;' and to give  communities  control  over the state provision  of  security.  In  recent  years,  within  this time  of foment  and possibility,  social  movements have been  proposing,  creating,  and  sometimes  establishing  new  governance  arrangements  that shift power over policing to those who have  been most harmed by mass criminalization and mass incarceration.  These recent pushes by social movements  for power shifting surface  a fundamental set of questions  about the very purpose  of police reform,  adding a  new way  for scholars  and reformers  to think about  the contours  and  objectives  of the  state's provision  of safety  and security -what this Article terms  the power lens.",cover,Simonson - 2020 - Police Reform through a Power Lens.pdf
"Although agencies are  the  dominant force  in  criminal law today, existing scholarship has largely failed to  analyze how these  bodies perform  as agencies. We  know  little about  how  the  institutional design of  these  agencies affects their output or  whether the  politics of regulation are  different when an  agency  is responsible for  the  regulation of  criminal justice issues as opposed  to  traditional regulatory areas.  This  Article takes  up that task  by evaluating the  agencies charged  with regulating one of the  most  important aspects of  criminal law:  sentencing. Many reformers turned to  agencies to  regulate sentencing because  they  did  not  trust the political process on its own  to  produce  rational sentencing policy in  a  tough-oncrime  culture. This Article explores what  kind of  model  works  for regulating criminal sentences if the  goal is to  create an  influential agency  that can  temper rash political impulses.  Drawing  from administrative law,  political science, and the actual experience of  state and federal commissions, the Article demonstrates thatcontrary to  conventional wisdom-the agency  model can  succeed.  But,  unlike other substantive areas where  an  independent agency  is seen  as  the  most  effective, an  insulated agency  model  is not a  viable answer  when the  agency  is responsible for regulating criminal sentencing. Instead, agencies responsible for sentencing are more efficacious when  they  are  politically enmeshed and  operate largely like  interest groups.  Like  an  interest group, a  well-connected agency  that can  produce politically salable information is more likely to  wield  influence than  one that is aloof from  political pressures.",cover,Barkow - 2004 - Administering Crime.pdf

"When human rights obligations conflict with investor rights, IIAs can be more clearly interpreted by understanding the state as a fiduciary. The fiduciary theory of sovereignty logically follows from a modern understanding of states' rights to exercise sovereign authority. 73 It provides a framework through which international investment law can be reconciled with a state's rights and obligations to protect its population's human rights. By recognizing the state as a fiduciary, stakeholders-such as treaty drafters, investors, and arbitrators-can better understand the nature of a state's authority when negotiating and entering into IIAs. Furthermore, this theory clarifies that IIAs cannot be interpreted in a way that puts a domestic population's human rights in conflict with a foreign investor's rights under an IIA.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"In Baker and Slaybaugh , the courts denied innocent homeowners' claims when the government destroyed their homes. In doing so, the Baker court recognized this outcome's manifest injustice, disserving ' '[t]he Fifth Amendment's guarantee . . . [that prevents the] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.' 185 It only increases the sense of injustice in Baker and Slaybaugh that the homeowners were denied compensation based on sources of law that they could not have known about, like customs recognized in feudal England and New York. And because the general law is not bound to any jurisdiction, these cases will set a nationwide precedent for uncompensated property destruction, leaving the foundational requirement that a background principle 'inhere in the title itself' uninterrogated. 186",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

Corrective-justice theorists emphasize this point in rejecting economists' deterrence-based arguments. 64 The logic of this position can be reframed in compensatory terms. Tort liability fully corrects for the injustice of injurycausing behavior when compensatory damages 'make it as if the wrong had never happened.' 65 The normative ideal of full and perfect compensation explains why deterrence is irrelevant for corrective justice.,body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"The Offset Provision cases were the perfect storm for a messy circuit split. ARPA was a highly political bill, the Offset Provision was complicated, and $200 billion were on the line. One legal doctrine at issue-standing-is inundated with inconsistency. The other-spending-is bereft of case law: a nascent jurisprudence likely to develop as Congress continues to rely on it. The Offset Provision cases were an intricate first attempt at conceptualizing together the two previously unwed doctrines. The fruits of the courts' analyses, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearly every case-regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments. The sovereign Spending Clause injuries are powerful tools: pleading strategies for ambitious states to destroy the federal policies they oppose. Spending Clause standing must have a higher standard, and special solicitude must not become a renewed red carpet for state plaintiffs.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

Yet,  they are the least regulated.  Two  core  requisites of  American constitutionalism  are democratic accountability and adherence to the rule of law. Democratic  accountability  ensures that  policy choices are vetted in the public arena and have popular  support; the rule of law requires that those choices be constitutional  as well.  Legislative enactments governing  policing are few and far between. Although police departments  have internal  rules, these rules are rarely  made public or publicly debated. When  it comes to regulating  policing, we rely primarily  on ex post judicial review,  which  at best  ensures policing practices are  constitutional (though it often  fails on this score), and does  nothing to assure  democratic  accountability or sound policymaking.",cover,Friedman and Ponomarenko - 2015 - Democratic Policing.pdf

"This Note fills that gap by demonstrating that the collision of ascendant general property law and the background principles exception could ultimately cause the Takings Clause to underprotect property interests. Part I provides background on the law of takings and describes the development of background principles jurisprudence. Next, Part II tracks the Court's recent shift toward a general law approach to property. Finally, Part III challenges the intuition that federal courts primarily apply general law to protect property rights, for example by preventing a state from 'extinguish[ing] a property interest . . . to avoid paying just compensation.' 26 To do so, it examines two recent cases 27 in the federal circuit courts that denied takings claims based on general law background principles.

"ABSTRACT:  The conventional  academic wisdom is that  prosecutor  elections are little  more than empty  exercises.  Using a  new,  national  survey  of local prosecutor  elections-the  first of its kind-this  Article offers a  more complete account  of the legal and empirical  landscape.  It  confirms that  incumbents are rarely contested and almost always win. But it  moves  beyond extant work to consider  the  nature of local political conflict,  including how  often  local prosecutors face  any  contestation  or any degree  of  competition.  It also demonstrates  a significant  difference in  the degree  of  incumbent entrenchment based on time  in  office.  Most importantly, it  reveals a  stark divide between rural  and urban  prosecution. Urban  areas are more likely to hold a contested election than rural  areas.  Rural  areas,  in which very few  lawyers live, rarely hold contested elections and sometimes  are not able  to field  even  a  single candidate  for  a  prosecutor election.  The  results suggest  that the  nascent movement  to  use prosecutor  elections as a source of criminal  justice reform may have success, at least in  the short term. But elections are, as of now, not a  likely  source of reform in  rural  areas-the  very  areas where incarceration rates continue to rise.",cover,Hessick and Morse - 2019 - Picking Prosecutors.pdf

"Most criminal prosecutions are  settled without a  trial.' The parties to  these settlements trade various risks and  entitlements: the  defendant relinquishes the right to  go to  trial (along with  any  chance  of  acquittal), while  the  prosecutor gives up  the  entitlement to  seek the  highest sentence or  pursue the  most  serious charges  possible. The resulting bargains differ predictably from what  would have  happened  had  the same cases been  taken to  trial. Defendants who bargain for a  plea  serve lower  sentences than  those who do not. 2  On the  other hand, everyone  who  pleads  guilty is, by definition, convicted, while  a substantial minority of  those who go to  trial are  acquitted. 3",cover,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf

"Although it is true that states suffer some form of sovereign injury when Congress exceeds its spending power, most of the Offset Provision decisions are simply too broad. An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something-anything-'sovereign' enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on 'dubious' and 'lawless' standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them. Because Congress often relies on its spending power for modern legislation, 24 an expansive 'welcome' mat into federal court risks further turning the judiciary into the arbiter of policy battles. 25",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Although  President  Obama's policies  have  sparked  particular controversy, his actions are not  unique. In  fact, the  practice of executive  policymaking through nonenforcement  stretches back  across recent  administrations.  One  commentator  accused  President  George W. Bush,  for example,  of pursuing  an agenda of ""deregulation through nonenforcement."" 7 The  reasons  for  increasing  executive  reliance  on nonenforcement, moreover, may  well  be structural.  In an  era  of presidential  administration  and  partisan  gridlock,  when  the  public holds  the  President  accountable for  failures of  national  policy  yet Congress cannot be relied upon  to develop legislative solutions, executive  officials  are  prone  to  adopt  an  expansive  understanding  of their  authorities.  Nonenforcement may  be  a  particularly  attractive policy  tool.  Since  it  benefits  some  and  penalizes  no  one,  statutory nonenforcement  may permit Presidents to  effectively  amend statutory policies, at least for the  duration of  their  presidencies, without provoking  focused  political  opposition.  But  executive  nonenforcement authority, if unbounded,  could substantially reorder the  Constitution's separation  of  powers  framework. By permitting  Presidents  to  read laws,  both  old  and  new,  out  of  the  Code  for  the  duration  of  their presidencies, unrestricted enforcement discretion could provide Presidents with a  sort of second veto-an  authority to remake  the  law on the ground  without asking Congress to revise  the law on the books. Developing  a  clear  understanding  of  the  proper  scope  of  executive enforcement  discretion  and  the  executive  branch's  law-enforcement duties is therefore  imperative.",cover,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf
"The Supreme Court has responded to these concerns with several efforts to guide judicial discretion in regulatory takings cases. 37 The first major effort arrived in Penn Central Transportation Co. v.

District attorney elections  are characterized  by low voter interest. 3 Candidates  regularly run unopposed. 4 In some jurisdictions it is difficult to find anyone  willing to take the job. This plays to two strengths of  progressive  reformers: (1) a  passionate voter  base and  (2)  access  to campaign financing  from  wealthy  donors  like George Soros.'  Strategic infusions  of campaign  funds  allow  reform  challengers  with  a  progressive message to mobilize like-minded voters and oust incumbent district attorneys.,cover,Bellin - 2020 - Expanding the Reach of Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf

District  attorneys  have  no boss.  They  answer solely to the  voters.  This  means that  District Attorneys  do  not need to clear their  policies  with  other  officials.

"Case law on whether the privilege expires at the edge of government is mixed. At least one federal district court considering a defense request for source code for an internet surveillance software held that the privilege 'applies only to government documents.' 263 The prosecution's apparent double dipping vexed the court: The prosecution initially denied discovery by claiming ignorance of how the software worked 264 andmaintaining that the software was controlled by a private vendor, 265 but then later asserted privilege to stop the defense from subpoenaing the vendor. 266 A different federal district court, however, upheld the privilege for an executable copy of the same software. 267 It reasoned that the privilege applied because the software, while owned by a private company, 'is exclusively used by law enforcement officers.' 268 In yet a third case, prosecutors argued that the privilege should extend to 'a quasi-law enforcement agency' and that private developers of surveillance and forensic software can qualify. 269 Meanwhile, nothing in current appellate doctrine stops the privilege from shielding information possessed by private entities, even information that no one in the government has ever seen.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Constitutionality is one thing; accuracy is another. The law enforcement privilege risks entrenching investigative methods and forms of evidence that are flawed or inaccurate by preventing defendants from putting them to the test. The privilege (like privileges generally) applies to every stage of a case, from pretrial suppression motions to post-conviction proceedings. 40 Hence, the privilege can block adversarial scrutiny of investigative methods even when the results of those methods are introduced as part of the government's case-in-chief at trial. It is worth emphasizing this point: The privilege is not just an issue at suppression hearings; it also reaches substantive evidence of guilt or innocence. When the results of a method are ultimately introduced at trial, the method veers from investigative to forensic. 41 In such circumstances, the law enforcement privilege still applies. Hence, the law enforcement privilege also risks propagating flawed or fraudulent forensic methods and unreliable evidence at trial.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

This problem is particularly poignant given the 'procedure fetish,' or the obsession with legitimizing government through procedure. 65 As Professor Nicholas Bagley has explained: 'We are . . . told that [strict procedural rules] are essential to public accountability because they prevent factional interests from capturing agencies.' 66 In the context of notice and comment, the procedure fetish manifests through the hurdles imposed by the courts in the 1970s and '80s. 67 Judge-made additions to the notice-and-comment process exemplify the procedural rules Bagley refers to in his scholarship, overlaying procedure on top of what was initially a bare-bones set of requirements.

"There is clear value to public participation in the rulemaking process. To the extent administrative agencies, despite being labeled by some as the 'fourth branch of government,' 12 are an extension of the democratically elected president and the executive branch, those same citizens who elect their president should have a voice in agency actions. What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts' current expectations. The statutory requirements of notice and comment are minimal; however, case law has expanded those requirements beyond what is feasible for agencies today and beyond what the drafters of the APA envisioned.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"Immanuel Kant's political philosophy, familiar in other legal contexts and exemplified by the parent-child relationship, illustrates the normative underpinnings of the fiduciary relationship. Kant's standard makes evident the types of relationships where fiduciary duties emerge. Thus, equipped with a standard for identifying these obligations, the relationship between directors and shareholders in domestic corporate law-the paradigmatic examplecan be clearly analogized to the state and its citizenry. The philosophical explanation and the analogy to corporate law clarify how the fiduciary relationship works and why it should be applied to sovereign states.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"We are now back to the conundrum with which we started. Criminal defendants sometimes have legitimate interests in accessing information about law enforcement methods, and police and prosecutors sometimes have legitimate interests in withholding that information. Yet, empowering the state to keep this information secret creates the risk that the secrecy power will be abused. Meanwhile, judges deciding whether to uphold a privilege claim must resolve an issue of specialized expertise without the benefits of a full adversarial process to educate them about the law and facts. The result leaves courts in a bind and disadvantages the entire truth-seeking process in cases that implicate life, liberty, and police accountability.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"For tort purposes, there are two normatively different types of pure economic losses not proximately caused by a predicate physical harm. The first involves financial harms that arise within contractual settings, such as the cost a consumer incurs to repair a defective product. Subject to certain exceptions, the contractually based economic loss rule bars tort recovery for these injuries. 249 These tort rules are justified by the need to maintain the integrity of the tort-contract boundary; they turn on the ability of right-holders to adequately protect their interests by contracting and are not relevant for our purposes. 250 The second type of pure economic loss occurs outside of contractual settings. As is true for the contractually based economic-loss rule, this one also bars recovery for pure economic losses subject to certain exceptions. The rationale for limiting the tort duty for these economic losses implicates the same concerns about excessive liability applicable to claims for stand-alone emotional distress.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Recent  Presidents have  claimed  wide-ranging authority to  decline enforcement of  federal  laws.  The  Obama Administration, for  example, has announced  policies  of abstaining  from investigation  and  prosecution  of certain federal  marijuana  crimes, postponing enforcement  of key  provisions of  the Affordable Care Act, and suspending  enforcement of removal statutes  against certain  undocumented  immigrants.  While these  examples  highlight  how exercises of executive enforcement discretion-the  authority  to turn a blind eye to  legal violations-may effectively  reshape federal policy, prior scholarship has offered  no  satisfactory  account of the proper scope of, and constitutional basis  for, this  putative  executive  authority.  This Article fills that  gap.",cover,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf

"When  I  came to  the  United  States Attorney's Office in 1983, it became  apparent that this was an  office with  a  proud  tradition. The office expressed pride in  its past in  various ways:  for example, new assistants were  provided Emory Buckner's biography 1  and  the  office's walls were  arrayed with  photographs of former  United States Attorneys and  criminal division chiefs. Senior lawyers in  the  office served as  a  link to  its past. But  because  lawyers generally left the office within a  few  years after fulfilling their three-year commitment, there were  not many of these  ""senior"" lawyers around and, with  the exception of one, they were  really not very  senior. Bill Tendy was,  of course, the  exception. He was  the one  prosecutor who had  served in that office in  the decades  of the  50s, 60s  and  70s.  He was,  thus, the bridge to, and  symbol  of, the  office's past.

"Drawing on  surveys  of police  departments  and judicial  decisions,  this Article traces  how  the  police  deploy  pretext  in new  and  different contexts  to justify  actions  that would  otherwise  be  unconstitutional. It  proffers  case studies  from three  distinct  law  enforcement  practices  to  illustrate  this trend. The  first  study  exposes  that  police  pretextually  claim  crime victim  status under  laws  that  protect  the  confidentiality of victims'  identities  to  shield themselves  from public  accountability  for misconduct.  The second case study reveals police  exploiting juvenile privacy  laws to extend  privacy  protections to officers,  thereby  evading accountability and curtailing  minors' due process rights.  A  third  case  study  shows  how  the  police  abuse  their  authority  by manipulating criminal  statutes  intended  to protect pregnant  people by instead criminalizing  their conduct.",cover,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf

"Notice and comment is a public participation process, first articulated in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that was heralded at the time as a critical innovation to engage the general population in the administrative agency rulemaking process. It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases-primarily at the circuit court level-which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

This evidentiary privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while concealing how those methods work from the defendants against whom they are used.

It is a qualified privilege, meaning that courts first decide whether the privilege applies and then balance the competing interests in secrecy and disclosure in any given case. 5 Though not always invoked and not always upheld, the privilege has been cited in over eleven hundred federal opinions in the past forty years and has almost certainly successfully concealed police conduct in many more discovery disputes that did not culminate in written opinions. 6",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Thus, in applying the normative calculus of tort law, judges need only agree that they must fairly or reasonably balance the conflicting interpersonal interests. They need not otherwise agree about the fully theorized meaning of reasonableness or fairness derived from a comprehensive rationale for tort liability, such as Kantian right, liberal egalitarianism, or utilitarianism. The institutional requirement to treat 'like cases alike' then provides the mechanism that, in principle, enables courts to coherently develop tort law over time and across cases based on these incompletely theorized agreements. 30",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"For these same reasons, a purely compensatory rule of strict liability can also be excessively costly for right-holders outside contractual settings. A wide range of risky behaviors contribute to the background level of reasonable risk in a community. For example, reasonably safe driving can still cause a crash. This familiar form of risky behavior is part of the background level of reasonable risk a community tolerates. The duty governing these kinds of common, risky social interactions burdens the ordinary person while creating risks (such as by driving); it also protects them from the risky behavior of others (like passing drivers on the roadway). For the category of risky interactions comprising the background level of reasonable risk in the community, the ordinary right-holder is also a reciprocally situated duty-bearer who incurs the full burden of the duty. This distributive outcome-like in contractual settings-eliminates a compensatory rationale for strict liability. 176",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Nonetheless, given the Spending Clause's flexibility, Congress increasingly relies on appropriating funds to achieve its policymaking goals in lieu of other Article I powers subject to the Senate filibuster, political polarization, and other constitutional impediments. 84 Congressional reliance on spending should not be mistaken for abuse. Professor Jonathan Gould explains that in recent decades, Congress's ability to regulate through other Article I powers has faced greater challenges under judicial review, with the Supreme Court crafting limitations on Congress's interstate commerce power and in other constitutional doctrines such as anticommandeering and nondelegation. 85 For better or worse, the Spending Clause is one of the federal government's few remaining means to reliably effectuate welfarist policies on a national scale. Furthermore, even in the hands of a Congress uninterested in redistributive policies, the fourth prong of Dole -that spending conditions cannot require states to engage in unconstitutional behavior-prevents serious threats against individual liberties. 86",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"This Article theorizes and reimagines the place of courts in the contemporary  struggle  for the abolition  of  racialized punitive systems of legal control and exploitation. In the spring  and summer of  2020, the killings of  George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many other Black and Indigenous people sparked continuous protests against racist police  violence and  other  forms of  oppression.  Meanwhile, abolitionist organizers and scholars have  long  critiqued the prison-industrial complex, or the constellation  of  corporations,  media entities, governmental actors, and racist and capitalist ideologies that have driven mass incarceration.  But between the police and the prison cell sits the criminal  court. Criminal  courts  are the legal  pathway  from an arrest  to a  prison  sentence, with myriad  systems of  control  in between, including ones  branded as  ""off-ramps.""  We  cannot understand the present  crisis  without understanding  how the criminal  courts not only function  to  legitimate  police and  funnel people into carceral  spaces but also contribute  their  own unique  forms of  violence, social  control, and exploitation. These mechanisms reveal the machinations  of  mass criminalization and  the injustices  operating  between the  police encounter and the prison cell.  Our central  argument is that courts with  a  focus  here  on criminal trial courts and the group of actors within  them function  as  an  unjust  social institution.  We  should therefore work toward  abolishing  criminal  courts and replacing  them with other institutions that  do not inherently  legitimate  police,  rely on jails  and prisons,  or  operate  as  tools  of  racial and  economic oppression.",cover,Clair and Woog - 2022 - Courts and the Abolition Movement.pdf

"The circuit majority's approach-not requiring imminence-comports with at least one scholarly conception of special solicitude. 206 Professor Bulman-Pozen argues that state suits against federal agencies (and expansive state standing to facilitate those suits) are desirable to ensure that federal officials 'come to the table' and bargain with the states on the terms of that federal policy. 207 Bulman-Pozen's argument is not based on the sovereignty of the state plaintiff-she concedes Massachusetts v. EPA 's confirmation that states have lost their sovereign prerogatives to the federal government. 208 Rather, it is based on her general view of federalism as a means to ventilate partisan disputes and create 'deliberation-generating froth in our democratic system.' 209 States, without their traditional autonomy, need a legal environment that can help facilitate this bargaining. 210 The expansive version of the Spending Contract injury would do just that.

"Aside from this Article, to my knowledge, the only other extended analysis of this question asks how courts should formulate tort rules in an 'age of austerity.' 267 An interesting question for sure. If a future wracked by climate change is one of increased scarcity, courts will 'have to make choices as to which violations of someone's basic rights should be remedied by the state.' 268 Rather than doing so by a 'ranking order of basic wrongs,' 269 courts, for reasons of principle, should rely on the same normative calculus which has shaped tort law from its origins in the customary practices in the state of nature up to its current incarnation. For principled reasons, a substantial reduction in compensatory resources will substantially contract substantive duties, significantly limiting liability in a manner akin to what tort law looked like in the earlier stages of industrialization. The contraction will not be that severefortunately, there is no debtor's prison this time around. But substantive tort",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Given broad academic consensus on these points, the pressing questions are how we got here and, especially, how we can get out. Theories proliferate. Notably, though, a diverse and accomplished group of scholars, following different intellectual paths, have recently converged upon the same basic conclusion. The retreat of local democratic control over criminal justice, these writers argue, precipitated the system's collapse; to reverse course, reformers must curb the influence of bureaucrats and redirect power to local communities to stimulate 'bottom-up populism.' 12 Aspects of this account have a decidedly counterintuitive cast: they require us to accept that politically liberal reforms to professionalize police and prosecutors, protect minority rights, and ensure equality of punishment across defendants had unintended and ultimately perverse effects. Yet however counterintuitive the theory may have been at its inception, the notion that we ought to 'trad[e] a good deal of expertise for a little democracy,' wrote Professor David Sklansky in 2008, 'probably reflects the general view among scholars today.' 13",cover,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf

"Concededly, officers engaged in knowing fraud or misconduct present the most challenging case because these individuals will find ex ante secrecy so valuable. Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals' incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their postdispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article's reform proposal will offer no benefit.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Consider Bishop Atterbury's eighteenth-century treason trial, in which counsel for the Bill of Attainder against Atterbury introduced encrypted letters seized from the mail. A witness claimed to have decrypted the letters and testified that their contents established Atterbury's guilt. The defense sought to challenge the accuracy of the witness's decryption methods. 213 Yet the witness refused to disclose his 'method and manner of decyphering' because doing so would 'instruct ill-designing men to contrive more difficult cyphers.' 214 The testimony was admitted over defense objection on the basis that it was 'not consistent with the public safety, to ask the decypherers any questions, which may tend to discover the art or mystery of decyphering.' 215 Privileges are public policy-based rules for withholding relevant evidence, 216 so the public safety rationale effectively recognized a privilege for the decryption method.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Strict liability sidesteps this evidentiary problem. As Oliver Wendell Holmes explained, in these cases 'the safest way to secure care is to throw the risk upon the person who decides what precautions shall be taken.' 159 Rather than have the court make the safety decision based on the evidence a plaintiff presents, strict liability 'throws' that decision on duty-bearers. To minimize their total cost of acting safely and compensating residual harms, strictly liable actors will take any precaution that reduces their liability (injury costs) in a cost-effective manner. If these risky actors would forego any of these precautions in a negligence regime because of proof problems, the shift to strict liability would increase safety measures and reduce the incidence of irreparable injury. 160",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

The  canon  effects  a  broadening of the usual  statutory  analysis,  allowing the  defendant to overcome  text that appears  unambiguous  on its face, and imposes  some  sort of heightened  burden  on the  government,  requiring  it to  prove  that Congress  really  meant to  criminalize the  conduct  at issue  through the  particular  statute. 9",cover,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf

In  her  view,  prosecutors  ""can protect  against  convicting  the  innocent.  They  can  guard  against  racial  bias. They can curtail  mass incarceration""  (p. xxvii). Because if prosecutors  reform their  pretrial-detention  requests,  charging  policies,  and  sentencing  recommendations,  criminal  justice  could  look  very  different.  This  has  been  the spark behind  the remarkably  successful  movement  to  transform  district  attorney elections  and place  reformers  in posts traditionally  held by tough-oncrime  prosecutors. 9 These  traditional prosecutors  were often unresponsive to concerns  that  they  were  putting  too  many  young  men, and  particularly young men  of color,  in  prison,  while  at  the  same  time  failing  to  prosecute cases  of police abuse  and violence  against citizens  (pp. 77-78).",cover,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf

"The Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits overstepped this circumscribed role. In those circuits, the courts' standing analyses went off track in part because they misapplied the substantive Spending Clause precedent. The Fifth and Eleventh Circuits did not treat Pennhurst 's clear-statement rule as a rule of statutory construction to protect the states from unexpected duties and suits. 265 Instead, as the Eleventh Circuit explained, they believed the Pennhurst requirement incorporated in the Dole rule 'is a binding constitutional command.' 266 Following the 'search and destroy' theme, the Fifth Circuit further argued that the Constitution imposes an affirmative 'bar on ambiguous spending conditions and provid[es] grounds for an injunction against the enforcement of such conditions.' 267 Ignoring the Supreme Court's reasoning in Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education , which provides that Congress is not required to 'prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular applications' of its spending conditions, 268 the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits effectively eliminated any interpretive wiggle room.

"Despite Congress's increasing reliance on the Spending Clause, the Offset Provision litigation was the first time that the standing issue had arisen. That is, until now, the Supreme Court has never had an opportunity to consider Spending Clause and state standing jurisprudence together. And for good reason: In cases applying Pennhurst 's clear-notice requirement, nongovernmental plaintiffs (who were not involved in the grant of federal funds) were actively bringing suit and the defendants (recipients of federal funds) used the clearnotice rule as a defense to their liability. 158 Furthermore, in Dole and Sebelius , there was no question that the relevant legislation's spending conditions directly affected and injured the state plaintiffs. 159 There was no uncertainty that the spending conditions had a concrete and particularized effect on the states in some way-the states had to act to get their money. As a result, standing was not the issue of contention.",body_text,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"The prospect of debtor's prison made it even more difficult for tort law to prioritize a right-holder's interest in physical security over the duty-bearer's conflicting liberty interest. Until the early-twentieth century, individuals who were rendered insolvent by tort judgments faced the prospect of going to jail because of debt. 119 Forms of tort liability that regularly threatened insolvency, therefore, implicated the ordinary duty-bearer's interest in avoiding prison.

"This Article explores the possibility of community nullification  beyond the  jury by  analyzing the  growing  and  unstudied phenomenon  of community  bail funds,  which  post  bail for strangers based  on  broader beliefs  regarding  the overuse of pretrial  detention. When  a community bail fund posts bail,  it can serve  the  function of nullifying a judge's  determination that a certain amount of the  defendant's  personal or family  money  was  necessary to ensure public safety and prevent flight.  This growing practice-what  this Article calls ""bail nullification""-is  powerful  because it exposes publicly what many within the system already know  to be  true: that although bail is ostensibly a regulatory pretrial  procedure,  for indigent defendants it often serves the function  that a real trial  might, producing  guilty pleas and longer sentences when an individual  cannot afford to pay their bail. By  examining the ways in which community  bail funds  serve  the functions  that a  nullifying jury  might-allowing popular  participation in an individual  case to facilitate larger  resistance  to  the policies and practices  of state actors-this  Article argues that community bail funds have the potential to change how  local criminal  justice systems  operate on  the ground, shifting and shaping  political and constitutional understandings of the  institution of money  bail.  Community bail funds give  a voice  to populations who  rarely have  a say  in  how  criminal  justice is administered, especially poor  people of color. And the study of  bail  funds helps point toward other ways in which bottom-up public  participation  can help create a criminal justice system  that is  truly responsive to  the communities that it is  ultimately supposed  to  serve.",cover,Simonson - 2016 - Bail Nullification.pdf

"Skeptics of the fiduciary theory may point to the perverse incentives and systemic resistance of arbitrators, but this takes for granted that the system will remain in its current form. Instead, it appears increasingly clear that this system must transform to survive. The latter two vehicles for the fiduciary theory, the judicial and atmospheric frameworks, would particularly complement this change in regime. All the judiciary approach requires to become actionable is amenable arbitrators, which will be more readily available with a standing court of arbitration. Arbitrators not beholden to certain types of parties will be more free to consider the public policy implications of their decisions. The adoption of the atmospheric approach by these arbitrators during this lead-up period will be transformative. It is more important than ever to disseminate theoretical frameworks through which stakeholders can understand and prioritize human rights obligations. Even if those who adopt the theory are not the arbitrators of today, they may be sitting on the bench tomorrow.",body_text,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"This normative attribute of the tort duty has an important implication: It explains why the duty can properly account for the availability of compensatory resources while still adhering to the principle that liability does not turn on the defendant's ability to pay for the tort judgment. The financial capacity of an individual defendant is a case-specific fact which does not properly factor into a principled evaluation of a general tort duty governing a category of cases. To apply the normative calculus of tort law in the requisite categorical manner, courts must first consider the burden the duty would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer within the relevant category of cases. Courts must then compare that burden to the protection such a duty would afford the legally protected interest of the ordinary right-holder. Whereas the financial capability of an individual defendant is irrelevant to this inquiry, the compensatory resources available to the ordinary duty-bearer can affect the normatively relevant burden of the duty.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to conclude that there is no hope for judge-made doctrine to bound the law enforcement privilege more reasonably. Judges have a mix of institutional incentives, including pressures to protect the interests of criminal defendants. 361 Secrecy concerning law enforcement investigative techniques does not entirely eliminate docket-clogging motions or thorny legal and constitutional issues. Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy. Even if investigative methods are disclosed under a strict protective order, the judge's conclusions as to their lawfulness and reliability need not be. Regardless of the overarching institutional incentives of the judiciary, some individual judges will wish to engage in a more probing review of law enforcement secrecy claims. This Article's proposal should help those judges.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"individual rights provisions of the Constitution,  but those act as poor safeguards against structural  abuses and inequities.  The current arrangement therefore  takes the  worst possible  approach to  separation of  powers  in the  criminal context. The protection  provided  by  the  separation of  powers is  weakened, but nothing takes its place.  As  a result,  the potential  for  government  abuse is,  perversely,  greater in criminal proceedings than in regulatory matters.  This Article  therefore advocates more  stringent enforcement of the separation of  powers in criminal cases,  where it is most needed. This approach would  lead to  different outcomes  in the Court's major separation of  powers cases  dealing  with criminal matters and would  result in a  rethinking of its  acceptance  of unreviewable  prosecutorial discretion  over charging and plea bargaining.",cover,Barkow - 2005 - Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law.pdf

"reform. Reflective of liberal  law reform projects  on police,  the DOJ  reports  identify policing  as a  fundamental tool of law and  order  that  serves the collective interests  of society, and locate the problems  of  police in their  failure to adhere to constitutional law.  As  a corrective, the DOJ reports advocate for investing more  resources in police:  more  trainings, better  supervision, community  policing. In  contrast, the Vision identifies policing as a  historical  and violent force in  Black communities underpinning a system  of racial capitalism and limiting the possibilities  of Black life.  Law is  central to  the shape and legitimation of this racialized violence and inequality.  As such, policing  as we  now know it cannot  be fixed.  Thus, the  Vision's reimagination  of policing-rooted  in  Black  history  and Black  intellectual traditions-transforms  mainstream approaches to reform. In  forwarding a  decarceral agenda rooted in  an abolitionist  imagination, the  Vision  demands shrinking the large footprint of policing, surveillance, and incarceration and shifting resources into housing,  health care,  jobs, and  schools. The  Vision focuses on building  power in Black communities  and transforming  the relationship  between state, market, and society.  In  so  doing, the  movement  offers  transformative,  affirmative  visions for change designed to address the structures of inequality-something  legal scholarship has lacked for far too long.",cover,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf

"This Article examines  the movement focus on power shifting in the governance  of the police at  both  the  local  and  national  levels.  It  fleshes  out  a  three-part  theoretical  account  of  why the power lens  is an important and necessary  addition  to how scholars  and reformers view the regulation  of policing.  First,  shifting power  to policed  populations  is  reparative,  in the sense  that it shifts  power  downward  toward populations  who  have  been  denied political  power  directly  as  a result  of the  history  of  policing policies  and practices  in  their neighborhoods.  Second,  power shifting  is  a  means  of promoting  antisubordination,  based  on  the  idea  that it is  wrong  for the state  to engage  in practices  that enforce  the  inferior social status  of historically  oppressed  groups. Third,  a power lens  on police  reform promotes  a particular view  of contestatory  democracy,  one in which  democratic  policing has  as  one  of its  objectives  the  facilitation  of countervailing  power for those  subject  to the domination  of the state.  Taken together,  the power lens  brings  a  critical eye to the ways  in which  the construction  of the notion  of ""expertise""  often denies  agency  to the people  who  most often  interact  with police  in  the streets  and on  the roads.  More  broadly,  the power lens opens  up discussions  of reform to first-order questions  about how the state should go about providing safety and security in our time,  with or without the police as we know it.",cover,Simonson - 2020 - Police Reform through a Power Lens.pdf

"In practice, however, the general law method seems unlikely to function as a one-way ratchet increasing property rights. This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support expansive property protections. Specifically, property interests could be underprotected by general property law's interaction with the background principles exception. To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims. These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to be over inclusive of background principles, as it necessitates a high level of generality. Second, placing the burden on plaintiffs to preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor. Third, general law approaches are incompatible with the requirement that background limitations inhere in a property owner's title itself.",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"It would probably be within the range of that exaggeration permitted in Washington to say that assembled in this room is one of the most powerful peace-time forces known to our country. The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous. He can have citizens investigated and, if he is that kind of person, he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations. Or the prosecutor may choose a more subtle course and simply have a citizen's friends interviewed. The prosecutor can order arrests, present cases to the grand jury in secret session, and on the basis of his one-sided presentation of the facts, can cause the citizen to be indicted and held for trial. He may dismiss the case before trial, in which case the defense never has a chance to be heard. Or he may go on with a public trial. If he obtains a conviction, the prosecutor can still make recommendations as to sentence, as to whether the prisoner should get probation or a suspended sentence, and after he is put away, as to whether he is a fit subject for parole. While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces",cover,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf

"The American criminal justice system's ills are by now so familiar as scarcely to bear repeating: unprecedented levels of incarceration, doled out disproportionately across racial groups, and police that seem to antagonize and hurt the nowdistrustful communities they are tasked to serve and protect. Systemic social ailments like these seldom permit straightforward diagnoses, let alone simple cures. In this case, however, a large, diverse, and influential group of experts-the legal academy's 'democratizers'-all identify the same disease: the retreat of local democratic control in favor of a bureaucratic 'machinery' disconnected from public values and the people themselves. Neighborhood juries, for example, internalize the costs of punishing their own; neighborhood police, 'of' and answerable to the community, think twice before drawing their weapons or stopping a local boy on a hunch. The experts and detached professionals who populate our dominant bureaucratic institutions, in contrast, are motivated by different, less salubrious, incentives. Across the gamut of criminal justice decision-making, the democratizers maintain, the influence of the local laity is a moderating, equalizing, and ultimately legitimating one. A generous dose of participatory democracy won't solve all our problems, but it's our best shot to get the criminal justice system back on its feet.",cover,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf
"This Part describes existing law enforcement privilege doctrine and argues that its requirements for asserting threshold claims to the privilege are so vague as to be practically meaningless. They boil down to a restatement of the privilege's underlying policy rationale: Disclosure could render an investigative method less effective. Yet, taken to its logical extreme, few, if any, investigative methods would not qualify for protection under this rationale. The result is an effectively boundless police secrecy power.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"American cities are under  attack. The last  few years have witnessed an explosion of preemptive legislation challenging and overriding municipal ordinances  across  a wide range  ofpolicy areas.  State-city conflicts over the municipal  minimum wage, LGBT antidiscrimination,  and  sanctuary  city laws have garnered  the most attention, but these conflicts are representative  of  a larger trend  toward state  aggrandizement.  These legal  challenges  to municipal regulation  have been accompanied by an increasingly  shrill anticity politics, emanating  from  both state and  federal officials.  This Article describes this  politics by way of  assessing  the nature  of-and reasons  forthe  hostility  to  city  lawmaking.  It  argues that anti-urbanism is  a  longstanding  and  enduring feature  of  American  federalism  and  seeks to understand  how a constitutional  system  overtly dedicated  to the principles  of devolution can be so hostile to the exercise of municipal  power.  The Article also provides a  current accounting of state preemptive  legislation and assesses  the cities 'potential  legal and  political  defenses. It concludes that, without a significant  rethinking  ofstate-based federalism, the American city is likely to remain  vulnerable.",cover,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf

"Pollock assumes that the damages remedy supplies the only protection against wrongful death, and so the common-law rule barring recovery implies that tort law does not protect individuals from fatal injuries. However, if tort law otherwise adequately accounts for these harms outside the damages remedy, then it could fairly protect individuals from the threat of premature death even in the absence of both criminal and tort liability. Put somewhat differently, although wrongful-death damages are neither fair nor full for the decedent right-holder, the tort right might nevertheless be constructed to fairly protect right-holders from bodily injury, including premature death. In that event, imperfect injury compensation via the damages remedy for wrongful death would influence the negligence rule's substantive formulation.

"Crucially, the law enforcement privilege presumes that the protected information is so sensitive that it cannot be disclosed to defense counsel or expert witnesses, even under a strict protective order. 121 This rationale can be taken to the extreme. Multiple courts have upheld a law enforcement privilege claim to withhold information from a defense expert witness. 122 The risk of abuse or misuse is obvious. Police and prosecutors might lie, exaggerate, or make a mistake about the importance of secrecy to the efficacy of an investigative method. They might overclaim the privilege due to a general culture of secrecy 123 or out of an institutional interest in avoiding adversarial scrutiny. 124 Or they might claim the privilege pretextually to willfully conceal negligent, unconstitutional, or even criminal conduct.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

Instead, it plucked a quotation from Steele and refrained from any nuanced discussion of state-specific law. 146 If the court had engaged with Texas law, however, it may have found that, at the very least, Baker's case deserved a remand to the trial court for further proceedings on the necessity issue. 147 It also could have certified the question to Texas courts for more guidance.",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"Prosecutors  are  the  most  powerful  officials  in  the  criminal justice system. At least ninety  percent  of all  criminal  cases  are  prosecuted  on the  state level,  and in  all but five jurisdictions, the  chief prosecutor  (also known  as the district  attorney)  is  an elected  official. Most district  attorneys  run unopposed  and serve for decades. However,  in recent  years, a number of incumbent district attorneys have been challenged and defeated by individuals who pledged to use their power  and discretion to reduce the  incarceration  rate  and eliminate  unwarranted  racial disparities  in the criminal justice  system.  These  so-called ""progressive  prosecutors""  have enjoyed  some modest  successes, but  many have  faced challenges-from within  and  outside  of their  offices. This Article  discusses  some  of these successes  and challenges  and  proposes guidelines  to assist newly-elected district  attorneys  who  are committed  to criminal justice reform.",cover,Davis - 2019 - Reimagining Prosecution A Growing Progressive Movement.pdf

"Instead, a combination of baseline criminal procedure rules and privilege law mitigate the graymail risk. The baseline criminal procedure rules do so in part by placing strict limits on defendants' affirmative rights to compel access to information. Importantly, defendants cannot compel access to irrelevant information. Criminal discovery rules require defendants to show that any documents or data they seek from the government are 'material to preparing the defense,' 106 meaning the information has 'more than . . . some abstract logical relationship to the issues in the case' and would enable them 'significantly to alter the quantum of proof in [their] favor.' 107 Criminal subpoenas require defendants to identify information with specificity and to establish in advance that the information is likely to be both relevant and admissible at trial. 108 And judges have broad discretion to deny harassing or frivolous discovery motions. 109 If these rules function correctly, defendants will only ever be able to compel access to information about law enforcement investigative methods that is likely to be relevant to their case-even if no privilege applies.",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Each of these reasons may well help to account for the current state of law enforcement privilege doctrine. Vagueness in the doctrine provides cover for deference. Deference, in turn, enables judges to avoid uncomfortable and time-consuming decisions. By maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes. Put succinctly, secrecy can forestall entire lines of motion practice that would otherwise clog dockets and force difficult rulings. 360",body_text,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Background principles are a strong medicine. 5 When a court analyzes a takings claim, it must first identify the property interest at issue before deciding the more complex, discretionary question of whether that property was 'taken.' 6 Background principles are 'logically antecedent' to this analysis, 7 meaning that they can foreclose an aggrieved property owner's claim before the first step. 8 If the court determines that, pursuant to a background principle, a plaintiff had no property interest to begin with, the government will completely evade takings liability for its interference with the plaintiff's property. 9 Judges, too, can use background principles to avoid difficult legal and factual questions that may arise later in the takings analysis. 10",body_text,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"The  haze  surrounding  prosecutors  is  both  descriptive  and  conceptual. On  the  descriptive  side,  we know  much  less  about  prosecutors  than  we  do about the  other main  officials  in the  criminal justice system: judges and  the police. Unlike judges,  prosecutors  generally  do  not announce  the  grounds for their  decisions-or  even,  often,  the  fact that they have  made  a decision. And  unlike  the  police,  prosecutors  carry  out  most  of their  work  behind closed  doors.

"Take, for example, charge bargaining, the primary mechanism by which prosecutors  control  defendants'  sentencing  exposure,  and  with  it  the  socalled  trial  penalties  defendants  face  if  they  dare  refuse  a  prosecutor's invitation  to  plead  guilty.  Long  criticized  as  an  illicit  form  of  coercion, charge bargaining presents a conundrum under the traditional scholarly account: Given the breadth and depth of substantive criminal law, charge bargaining is routinely diagnosed as a major driver of plea bargaining's pathology; 11 but  given  prosecutors'  constitutional  authority-indeed,  their responsibility-to select the charges a defendant will face, it is also seen as  an  inevitable  feature  of  criminal  law's  administration. 12 If  one  looks beyond substantive and constitutional criminal law, however, charge bargaining's power dynamics become far more complex, for the essential particulars of  the  practice-ranging from the number of charges the prosecutor can file,  to  their  severity,  to  their  relationship  to  the  defendant's  sentencing exposure,  to  the  ease  with  which  they  can  be  traded  away-all  directly impact just how much leverage the prosecutor truly has. And crucially, those particulars are in turn dictated by the subconstitutional procedural law of the states-an interlocking set of legal frameworks that comprises the law of joinder and severance, the law of preclusion, the law of cumulative sentencing,  the  law  of  pretrial  charge  review,  the  law  of  dismissal  and amendment, and the law of lesser offenses. 13",cover,Crespo - 2018 - The hidden law of plea bargaining.pdf

"There  is a  better explanation for the  tension between  courts and  practitioners on  the one  hand,  and  theorists on  the  other: plea bargains are both paradigmatic  bargains of  the  sort  we routinely enforce  in  other  contexts and the product of  a  seriously flawed  bargaining structure. The critics, for their part, have  misused or  misapplied classical contract arguments for limiting contractual autonomy.  Properly understood, classical contract theory supports the freedom to  bargain over  criminal punishment. At  the  same time, there are  fundamental structural impediments  in  the  plea  bargaining context that may underlie the widespread antipathy to  the  practice.

"Weshow in this Article that the targeting of dual-use objects over the last several decades has blurred this line, placing civilians at great risk. The United States has played a critical role in the increasingly expansive targeting of dual-use objects. Indeed, most accounts of the origins of dualuse targeting start with the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led coalition responded to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait with airstrikes on Iraq's electrical infrastructure and bridges. The Article reviews the history of dual-use targeting and presents an original dataset and primary-source evidence from the sites of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2018 to illustrate the wide range of dual-use objects that the U.S. military has struck. It draws on ground reporting and research to show the true costs of this dual-use targeting for civilians living in areas of conflict. The United States is far from alone in targeting dual-use objects, but we focus on it because it shapes the law of armed conflict by projecting force around the world, providing legal justifications for its use of force, and setting the standards by which other states are measured. Finally, this Article recommends that states engaging in military operations collect better information about dual-use objects so that they can make better-informed targeting decisions. We also offer several recommendations for clarifying international humanitarian law to prevent further erosion of the protections the law provides to civilians during war.",body_text,yale_law_journal_The_Dangerous_Rise_of_Dual_Use_Objects_in_War

"As previously discussed, compensatory resources are also scarce because defendants often do not have enough money to satisfy their tort judgments. Under the early common law, a judgment that rendered the defendant insolvent was not simply a financial matter. The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment. 13 Debtor's prison-a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century 14 -supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability. Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant's culpability. The subsequent emergence of modern bankruptcy law eliminated the burden of criminal punishment from this normative calculus. In principle, the transformation of debtor's prison into modern bankruptcy could expand the scope of substantive tort liability, a dynamic that has never adequately factored into the leading accounts of tort law.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Since 2016, candidates labeled  as  ""progressive  prosecutors""  have  achieved increasing  success  at the  polls.' They  are brought together,  and supported, by notfor-profit  organizations  such  as  Fair and Just Prosecution 2 and the  Association  of Prosecuting  Attorneys. 3 Elected  as  reformers,  these  prosecutors  have  generally responded  to  over-incarceration  and  racial  injustice  in  the  criminal  process  by adopting policies  to reduce the number of prosecutions of low-level  criminal cases, decrease  the number of defendants jailed before  trial, and hold police  accountable for  overreach. 4 Many  progressive  prosecutors  have  faced  pushback from judges, other public officials,  police,  the media,  constituents,  and subordinate prosecutors. This Article  draws a  distinction between  progressive  criminal justice  goals  and the process by which contemporary progressive  prosecutors seek  to obtain these  goals, arguing that the goals  are certainly legitimate  and may  be laudable, but the process of  implementing  them  is  often  both  inconsistent  with  the  prosecutor's role  and likely to  invite challenges.",cover,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf

To do this, judges should assess how law enforcement itself previously treated the purportedly privileged information.

Perhaps the appropriate set of procedural rules would provide a much more sensible way to fairly distribute a defendant's limited pool of assets across multiple tort claimants. 259 Such a procedural solution would make limiting the substantive duty unnecessary to give the physically harmed victims a reasonable opportunity to obtain full recovery.,body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Scholars  have  long  studied  the  power  of community  actors  to  nullify official  decisions by state actors  in the criminal justice  system.' This scholarship  analyzes  ""nullification"" as a  process  involving jurors:  when citizens  on a jury acquit  someone  despite their legal  guilt,  the jurors  make  a  potent  statement  about a  particular  defendant or law,  in the  process  transferring  power from legislatures,  judges,  and prosecutors to  a  small  group of citizens. 2 This focus  on the jury  as  a site  of nullification  is  understandable-jury  nullification  has  been  a  prominent  feature  of American  criminal  justice  since  the country's founding,  and  the  jury plays  a  singular  role  as  the  ultimate  moment of community input into  a criminal  case. 3 But the  power of the jury is waning.

"The notice-and-comment process has become a cumbersome, unreliable, and inequitable process. It is thus in agencies' interests to use the good cause exception alongside other methods of public engagement to justify bypassing notice and comment. Although the Ninth Circuit has held that the exception was not created to bypass notice and comment, it did so without considering the practical challenges outlined in this Note, many of which were less prevalent or apparent in 1992 when the Ninth Circuit made that observation. 79 Further, some courts have found that agencies can invoke good cause when engaging in standard notice and comment would undermine the underlying statute's purpose. 80 This jurisprudence is relevant in that notice and comment as it currently exists undermines the purpose of the APA itself-to engage the entire public-because it privileges some parties over others and may even go so far as to dissuade agencies from rulemaking at all because of the procedural burden. 81",body_text,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

In this, the congressional OLCs set a precedent for other components of the congressional bureaucracy-for example, CRS-that have been stymied by a kind of hyperneutrality that demands that congressional bureaucrats avoid answering consequential questions entirely.

"Drawing on  legal scholarship and empirical social scientific research, Part  I describes injustices  perpetrated  by criminal  courts, detailing  their  role  in  the  present crisis of mass  criminalization through legal doctrine,  racialized  social control and violence,  and economic exploitation. Part  II describes the  contemporary  abolition movement,  briefly laying out its genesis and three guiding  principles typically considered  in  relation to policing and prisons: (1) power shifting,  (2)  defunding and reinvesting, and (3)  transformation.  Part III  explores how  these principles could operate in  relation to  the courts, drawing  on analysis  of  existing  grassroots  efforts and  offering new possibilities.  In the short  term, non-reformist  reforms could  make criminal  courts a venue  to unmask, and therefore aid in dismantling, police  and prisons.  Such  reforms  could complement  the  broader abolition  movement  and reduce  the  churn  of people  through  the criminal  legal  system.  Ultimately, the goal  is to abolish  criminal  courts as sites of coercion, violence,  and exploitation and to replace them with  other social institutions, such  as  community-based restorative justice  and peacemaking programs,  while  investing  in  the  robust provision  of  social,  political, and  economic resources  in marginalized communities.",cover,Clair and Woog - 2022 - Courts and the Abolition Movement.pdf

It begins by debunking a generally accepted account of the privilege's history that invites simplistic thinking about the ease of reform. Next, it assesses existing arguments that the privilege should be abolished either entirely or with regard to information possessed by nongovernmental entities. These arguments may well help to mobilize a sympathetic, pro-transparency audience around a shared set of beliefs, but they each have important limitations that make them unlikely to persuade skeptics.

"The demands that emerged amid the 2020 uprisings  against police violence and white supremacy  brought into the national  consciousness  radical ideas  for change in how the state  should provide  safety  and security.

"For these same reasons, courts can defensibly permit recovery for economic loss outside contractual settings when the negligence does not threaten any foreseeable physical harms. For example, courts permit recovery for pure economic losses if there is 'some special relation between the parties' such as 'a telegraph company's negligent transmission of a message,' the 'negligent failure to perform a gratuitous promise to obtain insurance, and the negligent delay in acting upon an application for insurance.' 257 The negligent misconduct in these cases does not threaten any foreseeable physical harm, eliminating the need to limit the duty so that the 'worst go first.' Courts have also departed from the physical-harm requirement to award damages for the reasonable medical costs of monitoring for future bodily injuries, such as cancer. Like the ordinary duty governing physical harms, the substantive duty encompassing the financial costs of medical monitoring is grounded in the equitable concern to prevent these irreparable bodily injuries from happening. 258",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Under conditions of scarce compensatory resources, the problem of irreparable injury justifies prioritizing ex ante prevention over ex post monetary compensation. To do so, tort law must prioritize the right-holder's interest in physical security (the protected object) over the duty-bearer's compensatory obligation and the associated burden on liberty. By justifying a relative interpersonal priority of the individual interest in physical security, the problem of scarce compensatory resources also creates two distinctive rationales for strict liability.",body_text,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"Algorithmic  tools  for  predicting  violence  and  criminality  are increasingly  deployed  in  policing,  bail,  and  sentencing.  Scholarly attention  to  date  has  focused  on  these  tools'  procedural  due  process implications. This Article considers their interaction with the enduring racial  dimensions  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  I  consider  two alternative  lenses  for  evaluating  the  racial  effects  of  algorithmic criminal justice: constitutional doctrine and emerging technical standards  of  'algorithmic  fairness.'  I  argue  first  that  constitutional doctrine is poorly suited to the task. It often fails to capture the full spectrum of racial issues that can arise in the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice. Emerging technical standards of algorithmic fairness are at least attentive to the specifics of the relevant technology. But the technical literature has failed to grapple with how, or whether, various technical conceptions of fairness track policy-significant consequences. Drawing on the technical literature, I propose a reformulated metric for  considering  racial  equity  concerns  in  algorithmic  design:  Rather than  asking  about  abstract  definitions  of  fairness,  a  criminal  justice algorithm should be evaluated in terms of its long-term, dynamic effects on  racial stratification.

"So-called independent agencies are created for a  reason, and  often that reason is a  concern with  agency capture. Agency  designers hope  that a  more insulated agency  will better protect the  general public interest against interest group pressure. But  the  conventional approach to  independent agencies in  administrative law  largely ignores why agencies are  insulated. Instead, discussions about independent agencies in  administrative law have focused on three features that have  defined independent agencies: heads  who are removable for cause by the  President, an  exemption from  having to  submit regulations to  the  President's Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs for cost-benefit analysis, and  a  multimember  structure.",cover,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf

"The final prong, ongoing engagement during implementation, has obvious benefits, although it does not directly correspond with any requirement under traditional notice and comment. The Biden Administration approached this prong as an opportunity to meet with 'community organizations and data users to discuss the various changes . . . and to ensure that stakeholders understand' how a new rule or regulation works. 96 These engagement efforts could mirror the listening sessions, town halls, and direct outreach that take place during rulemaking. But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA's original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers' lives simpler.
