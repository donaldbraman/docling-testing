While  faculty  members  enjoy multiple layers of protection through tenure, contracts, and legal precedents, students must rely solely on discretionary university policies interpreted by the  administrators  who  restrict  their  speech.  Through  analysis  of  recent campus conflicts, this essay argues that current frameworks for protecting student academic freedom in private universities are fundamentally inadequate and proposes establishing institutional oversight boards inspired by  social  media  governance  models.  Unlike  temporary  committees,  these boards  would  provide  consistent,  transparent  adjudication  processes  while building precedent for future cases. This essay demonstrates why university implementation of such oversight mechanisms offers distinct advantages over social  media  models,  including  manageable  case  volumes  and  clearer contextual  standards.  By  creating  institutional  separation  of  powers,  these reforms would help align administrative actions with stated commitments to academic freedom while maintaining necessary operational control.",
