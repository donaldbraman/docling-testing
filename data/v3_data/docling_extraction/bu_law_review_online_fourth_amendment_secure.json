Doing this work reasonably means reducing risks and threats of physical harm, not escalating them. For example, even if the LMPD officers had grounds to search Taylor's apartment for drugs, it would have been unreasonable to do so at night, when the police could have known she was home and likely in bed, rather than earlier in the day when she was at work.",
