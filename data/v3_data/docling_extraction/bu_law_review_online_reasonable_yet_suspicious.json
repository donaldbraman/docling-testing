      "text": "Relatedly, based on similar empirical data, several courts recognize that an individual's race is relevant to when they have been 'seized' by police. In 2022, the Washington Supreme Court 'formally recognize[d] what has always been true: in interactions with law enforcement, race and ethnicity matter,' holding that courts  must consider race when determining whether that individual has been seized by law enforcement. 40 New Hampshire's highest court also held that 'race is an appropriate circumstance to consider in conducting the totality of the circumstances seizure analysis.' 41  Federal circuit courts are in conflict: the Ninth and  D.C.  Circuit  have  held  that  a  defendant's  race  can  inform  the  seizure analysis, 42  but the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits exclude consideration of race in the seizure analysis, arguing that doing so would transform an objective inquiry into a subjective one. 43"
