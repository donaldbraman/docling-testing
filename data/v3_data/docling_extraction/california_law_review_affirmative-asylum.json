In fact, we believe that a non-adversarial process is appropriate and necessary for asylum seekers, many of whom have suffered traumatic experiences in their home country that are painful to recount, especially in an adversarial environment.'); Cent. Am. Res. Ctr. of N. Cal., Comment Letter on Procedures for Credible Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers 2 (May 31, 2022), https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USCIS-2021-0012-5309 [https://perma.cc/A36D-JVP3] ('Moreover,  we  commend  how  the  rule  gives  respondents  --  many  of  whom  will  inevitably  be unrepresented -- a chance to make their case at the Asylum Office, before needing to bring their case to immigration court, with its adversarial setting and more complicated procedural requirements.')."

To ensure  adjudications  are  faithful  to  the  law  and  consistent  across  offices  and interviews are conducted in a truly non-adversarial manner, I recommend hiring more qualified adjudicators and inviting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to monitor adjudications.

In these instances, the noncitizens were clearly aware of the fraud. But in other cases, applicants are also defrauded.

They ask the individual to sign a form but do not tell them that it is an asylum application. Id. When the noncitizen fails to appear at the asylum interview, they are placed in removal proceedings. In some cases, the attorney withdraws the asylum application and files for a form of relief known as cancellation of removal for non-permanent residents (which does require ten years of physical presence but also requires proof of 'extreme, unusual, and exceptional hardship' to a qualifying family member, a difficult standard to meet). Id. Because of the prevalence of the scam, the DOJ's fraud and abuse prevention program warns noncitizens about it, and the Asylum Office reserves days (in some instances once every week) to interview (and usually quickly refer) applicants who have filed for asylum more than ten years after their arrival in the country.

      "text": "395. Like all benefit systems, fraud exists in the affirmative asylum system. The U.S. Attorney's Office  has  prosecuted  individuals  for  helping  people  file  frivolous  asylum  claims. See,  e.g. ,  Press Release, U.S. Att'ys Off. S. Dist. of New York, Attorneys and Managers of Fraudulent Asylum Scheme Charged in Manhattan Federal Court (Feb. 18, 2021), https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/attorneysand-managers-fraudulent-asylum-scheme-charged-manhattan-federal-court [https://perma.cc/JAU2TZYQ] (charging nine individuals for schemes to prepare and submit fraudulent asylum applications to the USCIS); Press Release, U.S. Att'ys Off. S. Dist. of New York, Brooklyn Attorneys Sentenced for Asylum  Fraud  Scheme  (May  31,  2023),  https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/brooklyn-attorneyssentenced-asylum-fraud-scheme [https://perma.cc/7CFS-A6JC] (sentencing two licensed immigration attorneys to prison for an asylum fraud scheme). In these instances, the noncitizens were clearly aware of the fraud. But in other cases, applicants are also defrauded. Under one scheme, known as the '10Year Green Card/Visa Scam,' attorneys or unauthorized practitioners inform noncitizens that they can receive work authorization because they have been in the United States for ten years or because they have a relative who is a U.S. citizen. Off. of the Gen. Couns., Fraud and Abuse Prevention Program , E XEC . O FF . FOR I MMIGR . R EV .,  https://www.justice.gov/eoir/fraud-and-abuse-prevention-program [https://perma.cc/Q88X-RWTS]; Avoid Becoming the Victim of Immigration Fraud ,  NYC M AYOR ' S O FF . OF I MMIGRANT A FFS .,  https://www.nyc.gov/site/immigrants/legal-resources/avoid-fraud.page [https://perma.cc/28HH-TVPJ]. They ask the individual to sign a form but do not tell them that it is an asylum application. Id. When the noncitizen fails to appear at the asylum interview, they are placed in removal proceedings. In some cases, the attorney withdraws the asylum application and files for a form of relief known as cancellation of removal for non-permanent residents (which does require ten years of physical presence but also requires proof of 'extreme, unusual, and exceptional hardship' to a qualifying family member, a difficult standard to meet). Id. Because of the prevalence of the scam, the DOJ's fraud and abuse prevention program warns noncitizens about it, and the Asylum Office reserves days (in some instances once every week) to interview (and usually quickly refer) applicants who have filed for asylum more than ten years after their arrival in the country.

      "orig": "Part I addressed how policymakers in the 1990s attempted to reform the Asylum Office through mostly modest means. Under the reforms, AOs were intended  to  swiftly  grant  asylum  to  asylum  seekers  with  legitimate  claims through  brief,  trauma-informed  interviews  and  to  refer  others  with  nonmeritorious or complicated claims to immigration court for IJs to provide de novo review. Instead, as demonstrated in Part III, the Asylum Office has evolved into a backlogged, unjust adjudication system. After subjecting asylum seekers to  often  lengthy  waits  and  confrontational  interviews,  AOs  funnel  them  into removal proceedings simply because it is faster. As one of our interviewees, a former senior official in the Asylum Office, explained, 'The whole point of the [asylum  system]  was  to  reduce  the  amount  of  people  going  to  immigration courts. If people are just going to end up in immigration court anyway, what's the point of any of this?' 437",
      "text": "Part I addressed how policymakers in the 1990s attempted to reform the Asylum Office through mostly modest means. Under the reforms, AOs were intended  to  swiftly  grant  asylum  to  asylum  seekers  with  legitimate  claims through  brief,  trauma-informed  interviews  and  to  refer  others  with  nonmeritorious or complicated claims to immigration court for IJs to provide de novo review. Instead, as demonstrated in Part III, the Asylum Office has evolved into a backlogged, unjust adjudication system. After subjecting asylum seekers to  often  lengthy  waits  and  confrontational  interviews,  AOs  funnel  them  into removal proceedings simply because it is faster.

Third,  to prevent a backlog from developing and AO attrition, the United States should adopt a framework for group-based asylum claims. Fourth, for applications that cannot be granted on paper, I suggest more brief interviews. Fifth and sixth, to ensure that adjudications are faithful to the law and consistent across offices and interviews  are  actually  conducted  in  a  non-adversarial  manner,  I  recommend hiring  more  qualified  adjudicators  and  inviting  the  UNHCR  to  monitor adjudications. Seventh, and finally, for a new system based on paper claims to work, I explain why increasing representation rates for asylum seekers is crucial.",
      "text": "This  Section  describes  seven  reforms  to  create  an  affirmative  asylum system that is efficient and fair. First, I argue that AOs should not be diverted to border work but should exclusively focus on adjudicating affirmative asylum claims. Second, to provide the new system with a fresh start, I suggest ways to clear  the  backlog  of  currently  pending  affirmative  asylum  claims.  Third,  to prevent a backlog from developing and AO attrition, the United States should adopt a framework for group-based asylum claims. Fourth, for applications that cannot be granted on paper, I suggest more brief interviews. Fifth and sixth, to ensure that adjudications are faithful to the law and consistent across offices and interviews  are  actually  conducted  in  a  non-adversarial  manner,  I  recommend hiring  more  qualified  adjudicators  and  inviting  the  UNHCR  to  monitor adjudications. Seventh, and finally, for a new system based on paper claims to work, I explain why increasing representation rates for asylum seekers is crucial."
