Disagreement is largely about how powers should be parsed and which should be shared. Yet over  the  long  lifespan  of  our  constitutional  tradition,  momentous doctrinal upheavals are relatively commonplace. This Article describes four tectonic shifts in separation-of-powers doctrine: Founding-era  debates  about  how  to  define  and  blend  powers, nineteenth-century debates about the constitutionality of the nascent civil  service, Lochner -era  debates  about  legislatures'  authority  to define and  regulate public utilities, and  mid-nineteenth-century debates about the sources of international law. The first, which we call the Inherency Theory, assumes that certain powers and functions are vested by force of the Constitution, are core to a single branch, and are discernible by the judiciary. This is a taxonomical theory of how the Constitution allocates powers, and it animates nearly all of today's separation-of-powers debates. The second, an Antidomination Theory, denies that the words executive, legislative, and judicial imply any new or distinct powers and instead creates formal separation between the three branches based on the procedures federal actors deploy to enact, enforce, and interpret policy. The third, a rights-based Public Utility Theory,  distinguishes  between  a  public  sphere  that  is  subject  to congressional, presidential, and administrative control, and a private sphere that is not. Recently, this public-private distinction has been marshalled to define the judicial power. Historically, however, it was used  to  deduce  a  whole  panoply  of  structural  limits,  including  the constitutionality of agency adjudication and deference. And the fourth, a General Law approach, discerns the limits of government power by reference to the eclectic authority of the common law and right reason. Recovering  these  theories  reveals  a  rich  set  of  tools  for  resolving interdepartmental disputes, highlights that current receptions of past settlements are nearly unintelligible without understanding the theoretical context in which they emerged, and suggests that, while different theories have risen and fallen, no one theory of separation of powers has been liquidated in our constitutional tradition.",

In foregrounding a science of politics as a theory of separated powers, the episodes we describe here are reminiscent of Levinson and Pildes's call to integrate a modern political science of 'parties' into our structural constitutional law. See Levinson & Pildes, supra note 50, at 2325-29 (noting that, in contrast to constitutional scholars, political scientists 'have long appreciated political parties' leading role in enforcing the separation of powers'). Notably, in these episodes, constitutional actors were aware they were defending their separation-of-powers theories not with constitutional formalisms, but rather with claims about necessary updates to, for example, the Senate's consensus view of political science.",

By  the  1820s,  an increase in the frequency of removal caused the voting public to take a 'violent exception' to the emerging patronage system. 230 The concern was that competent officers were being removed to make room for favored appointees of each new presidential administration. Legislative proposals during this period failed, but the opposition they faced turned, once again, on pragmatic arguments. Senators felt that proposed limits on removal were bad policy, not that they violated the Constitution.",

Legislative proposals during this period failed, but the opposition they faced turned, once again, on pragmatic arguments.
