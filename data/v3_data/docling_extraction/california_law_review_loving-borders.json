Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades  of  constitutional  case  law  by  denying  courts  a  role  in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court's substantive due process analysis in Muñoz. 10 Invidious  discrimination  drove,  and  was  manifested  in,  the  Court's reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent.

The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications of Muñoz for the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
