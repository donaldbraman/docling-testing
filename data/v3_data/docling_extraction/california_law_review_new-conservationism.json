Part III.A explains how I set about answering this  question  through  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  analyses.  Because NEPA analyses must include detailed statements of removals' environmental effects, these documents provide a rich account of agencies' consideration of effects to individual animals. I assembled and investigated a unique set of more than one hundred NEPA analyses completed by agencies contemplating removal decisions. In particular, I investigated agencies' treatment of abundant animals because  their  treatment  implicates  concern  for  animals'  intrinsic  value,  as discussed in Part II."

Id. at 15-16. By contrast, I included NPS's  N AT ' L P ARK S ERV ., F IRE I SLAND N ATIONAL S EASHORE F INAL W HITE -T AILED D EER M ANAGEMENT P LAN AND E NVIRONMENTAL I MPACT S TATEMENT (2015), which describes its purpose as 'support[ing] protection, preservation, regeneration, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural and cultural resources.' Id. at  1.  The  purpose statement subsequently references 'reduc[ing] undesirable human-deer interactions' and public education about tick-borne diseases. Id. However, the EIS begins its analysis of environmental effects by investigating vegetation impacts, considers effects to public health and safety only toward the end of a long list of consequences, and predicts that these benefits will 'not be significant because the Seashore already takes many steps to provide a safe and healthful environment . . . by removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures.' Id. at 19095 (quoting 'Conclusion' sections). The purpose's wording and the modest expectations for public health  and  safety  suggest  that  vegetation-based  concerns  (i.e.,  ecosystem  or  land-based  concerns) animate the removal decision."

If  ecological  collectives  and individual wild animals have inherent value, then getting the balance right in protecting  these  animals  matters.  Insofar  as  agencies  range  widely  in  their treatments, it seems unlikely that they are all striking the right balance. That said, one  need  not  endorse  inter-agency  uniformity  to  endorse  rational,  coherent approaches within agencies and decisions. 265"

      "text": "To calculate a policy's net welfare impact, agencies must tally all the harms and benefits that come from a policy. For removals, a partial list of relevant effects includes: physical or psychological suffering of removed animals; losing the opportunity of further life in the wild (which could be a benefit or harm, depending on how difficult the removed animals' lives are); benefits and harms to individual animals from nonabundant populations; and human preferences for recreation, aesthetics, and the like. Although agencies would need to develop a means of comparing these interests to one another, relatively minor benefits to humans (e.g., preferring a forest with more orchids for aesthetic reasons) would not,  in  themselves,  justify  grave  harm  to  animals  (e.g.,  killing  hundreds  of deer). 270"
