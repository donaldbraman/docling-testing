      "text": "However, in contrast to basic justice principles, mid-level justice principles do not purport to cover the totality of social justice. Therefore, different basic justice principles can potentially endorse the same mid-level justice principle. 153 It may be possible for both a Rawlsian and a welfarist to agree on a mid-level justice principle. As will be discussed later, it is also theoretically possible for multiple mid-level justice principles to overlap in a specific policy domain. 154 Consequently, while mid-level justice principles are trans-substantive, they do not cover the totality of all domains in which social justice operates, unlike a basic justice principle."

Meanwhile, the EPA recommends at least a three-mile radius between fossil fuel plants and surrounding communities. Power Plants and Neighboring  Communities ,  EPA,  https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/power-plants-and-neighboringcommunities  [https://perma.cc/K3UB-AKPQ].  Situations  in  which  proposed  siting  decisions  create significant  justice-based  externalities  would  create  a  more  complex  analysis  where  the  normative considerations are likely to vary based upon the factual particulars of the given situation. I thank Alex Klass for raising this point."

      "text": "Given that agencies will likely be the primary institution to utilize mid-level justice principles in policymaking, great care should be spent in elucidating how this process should be structured. This care is all the more important given that it  is  unlikely  that  agencies  will  always  have explicit guidance from Congress regarding  how  this  process  should  be  done,  and  agencies  no  longer  receive deference in their interpretations of their governing statutes. The first subsection argues  that  agencies  should  first  structure  mid-level  justice  principles  as guidance documents and then gradually shift to promulgating them as rules once agencies settle on preferred mid-level justice principles and the best analytical practices. The second subsection then demonstrates that adding mid-level justice principles should be appealing to both proponents and detractors of CBA during regulatory  analysis  as  a  consistent  and  principled  framework  to  evaluate normative values that resist quantification."
