The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal  literature  to  argue  that  subsidizing  the  franchise  could  help rebalance elected officials'  perception  of  the  'median  voter'  away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and  constitutionality  of  paying  the  voter.  When  President  Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United  States.  Nevertheless,  this  Note  argues  that,  based  on  the legislative  history  of  the  Act,  a  government  program  to  incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",

      "orig": "Level-up  thinking  is  highly  relevant  to  a  voter  incentive  program.  The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in  cities  and  states  that  have  significantly  reduced  barriers  to  voting.  Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for smalldollar donors. 26 Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors. 27 Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result  in  greater  progress  towards  achieving  a  representative  electorate  and ultimately  addressing  democratic  imbalance.  A  great  policy  proposal  that leverages  this  type  of  level-up  thinking  to  address  electoral  imbalance  is  the Mobilization  Matching  Fund,  proposed  by  Professor  Bertrall  Ross  II. 28 This policy  would  use  federal  dollars  to  match  campaign  expenditures  used  to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent  electoral  participation,  commonly  referred  to  as  'low-propensity voters.' 29",
      "text": "Level-up  thinking  is  highly  relevant  to  a  voter  incentive  program.  The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient.

Every level of government, from the federal government to  the  county,  offers  some  form  of  tax  credit.  For  example,  the  federal government, California,  and  San  Francisco  all  offer  their  own  version  of  the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program the government operates through the tax code  to  the  benefit  of  low-income  working  families. 228 A  clear  benefit  of implementing a voter benefit program through the tax code is that governments possess the infrastructure to implement such a program. Indeed, a state could easily implement a voter incentive program by doing little more than including a new line-item on a voter's tax form. 229 Should policymakers implement the program  as  a refundable tax credit, the  government  could  leverage  an individual's direct deposit information to send them the incentive quickly and efficiently. 230"

I have demonstrated that a voter incentive program would likely pass statutory and constitutional muster. And with the right policy design-such as starting local and providing direct, visible, and infrequent incentives-a voter incentive policy might in fact bring new voters to the polls. All that remains is whether it is worth the time and the financial and political capital it would take for policymakers to take up such a proposal.",
