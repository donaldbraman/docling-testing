It  turns  out  to  be really difficult to draft a statute that will prevent state courts (at least) from considering the  constitutionality  of  the  CUI  statute's  substantive provisions.  Suppose,  though,  that  all  the  difficulties  were  overcome. With the state courts in the picture, we can now consider what seems to me  the  scholarly  consensus  about  jurisdiction-stripping.  According  to that consensus, our constitutional system rests on the presuppositionnot written anywhere in the Constitution (but we know that there are such presuppositions-see Trump v.

The best recent scholarship establishes that neither  Congress  nor  'the  country'  decisively  repudiated  the  Courtpacking plan. It was a close-run race up to the very end. FDR packaged the plan as a good-government measure, pretending that the Court needed new  members  to  do  work  that  elderly  justices  were  unable  to  do effectively. His disingenuousness impaired the political effort to get the plan adopted. Yet, constitutional language, mostly about judicial independence, pervaded the arguments of the plan's opponents.",
      "text": "Here everything turns, I believe, on whether we give constitutional significance to the defeat of FDR's Court-packing plan in 1937 (and on ignoring the Andrew-Johnson era reduction in the Court's size). Was that defeat an  ordinary  political  loss  or  did  it  somehow  establish  or consolidate  some  sort  of  constitutional  rule  limiting  the  occasions  for changing the Court's size? The best recent scholarship establishes that neither  Congress  nor  'the  country'  decisively  repudiated  the  Courtpacking plan. It was a close-run race up to the very end. FDR packaged the plan as a good-government measure, pretending that the Court needed new  members  to  do  work  that  elderly  justices  were  unable  to  do effectively. His disingenuousness impaired the political effort to get the plan adopted. Yet, constitutional language, mostly about judicial independence, pervaded the arguments of the plan's opponents."
