To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims.  These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to  be over inclusive  of background principles,  as  it  necessitates  a  high level  of  generality.    Second,  placing  the  burden  on  plaintiffs  to  preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor. Third, general law approaches are incompatible with the requirement that background limitations inhere in a property owner's title itself.",
