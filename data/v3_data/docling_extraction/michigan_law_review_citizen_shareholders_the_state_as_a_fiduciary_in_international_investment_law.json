After all, are these not the countries predominantly seeking foreign investment? But the data shows that investors disproportionately levy claims against these countries relative to the foreign investment the countries attract. Latin American countries received 9.3% of global FDI in 2022, yet they were subject to 27.5% of all investor claims. 48 In the same year, African countries received 5.4% of FDI but were respondents in 16.2% of all claims. 49 Not only are these countries disproportionately sued, but they also have lower rates of success in proceedings: Developed countries won 53.6% of all cases lodged against them, while developing countries won a mere 33.3% of claims. 50"

States can reference the fiduciary theory in treaty preambles, in statements made to the international community, or in IIA negotiations with other states; academics can continue to reference the theory in their scholarship; and nongovernmental and civil society actors can feature the theory in their advocacy work targeted at states, arbitrators, and investors. Additionally, any of these parties can argue the fiduciary theory through amici submissions in other ISDS cases. 136 Perhaps most importantly, investors can consider the fiduciary theory when interacting with host state populations and when deciding whether to bring ISDS claims."
