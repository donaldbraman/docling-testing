Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders' involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.",

This problem is particularly poignant given the 'procedure fetish,' or the obsession with legitimizing government through procedure. 65 As Professor Nicholas Bagley has explained: 'We are . . . told that [strict procedural rules] are essential to public accountability because they prevent factional interests from capturing agencies.' 66 In the context of notice and comment, the procedure fetish manifests through the hurdles imposed by the courts in the 1970s and '80s. 67 Judge-made additions to the notice-and-comment process exemplify the procedural rules Bagley refers to in his scholarship, overlaying procedure on top of what was initially a bare-bones set of requirements. These procedural hurdles were designed to make an agency more responsive to the general public, rather than factional interest groups.

The second step is to employ other means of public engagement to demonstrate to a court that, although notice and comment is impracticable, the agency has still made efforts to ensure the level of public participation intended by the drafters of the APA. This model of public engagement should be based on a series of tools and strategies employed by the Biden White House and its executive agencies from 2021 to 2025. 86 Although the Biden Administration applied these tools and strategies alongside notice-and-comment procedures, the framework they established, with some adjustments, is robust enough to stand in the place of notice and comment altogether.",

Given the evolving nature of administrative law today, 97 it seems as good a time as any for an agency to try its hand at moving the courts on this issue. The way a court will react to this new strategy depends on a number of factors, including, inter alia, the rule that is challenged, the party bringing the challenge, which court the challenge is brought in, 98 and who is in control of the White House when the challenge is brought."
