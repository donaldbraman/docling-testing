This evidentiary privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while concealing how those methods work from the defendants against whom they are used. The privilege is designed to apply to methods that would become ineffective if generally known. It is a qualified privilege, meaning that courts first decide whether the privilege applies and then balance the competing interests in secrecy and disclosure in any given case. 5 Though not always invoked and not always upheld, the privilege has been cited in over eleven hundred federal opinions in the past forty years and has almost certainly successfully concealed police conduct in many more discovery disputes that did not culminate in written opinions. 6"

[and] is not entitled to review or access material covered by the law enforcement privilege'); United States' Notice of Intent to Use Evidence and Request for an Evidentiary Hearing on the Defendant's Motion to Compel at 3, United States v. Chiaradio, No. 09-069 (D.R.I. Mar. 31, 2010), ECF No. 50 (asserting that prosecution 'wished to use EP2P evidence during its case-in-chief' because '[s]uch evidence is essential to proving the elements of the government's case'); Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Compel at 40-41, United States v. Chiaradio, No. 09-069 (D.R.I. June 3, 2010), ECF No. 55 (contesting law enforcement privilege); Docket Minute Entry at *11, United States v. Chiaradio, No. 09-069 (D.R.I.

      "text": "Finally, for certain limited categories of information deemed especially sensitive, privilege law provides additional protections against disclosure, and thereby against graymail as well. These heightened protections impose wellrecognized costs on the accuracy and fairness of adjudicatory outcomes because they necessarily suppress relevant evidence from the opposing party, judge, and jury alike. In the Supreme Court's oft-repeated words, privileges 'are in derogation of the search for truth.' 115 Privilege law attempts to balance those costs against the benefits that privileges supposedly provide for social policies that are extrinsic to the truth-seeking function of the courts. The following Section discusses the putative societal benefits of law enforcement privilege claims."

      "text": "What guidance does exist primarily concerns the second-step balancing procedure. Specifically, the Fifth and D.C. Circuits have adopted a ten-factor balancing test for weighing law enforcement privilege claims 162 drawn from a 1970s civil rights case called Frankenhauser v. Rizzo . 163 The factors include (1) the chilling effects of disclosure, (2) whether the information is factual or evaluative, (3) whether it is sought by a criminal defendant, and (4) whether there are alternate sources for the information, inter alia . 164 Though not bound, many federal district courts outside the Fifth and D.C. Circuits have also applied the Frankenhauser factors. 165 The only other appellate guidance on the balancing procedure is the Seventh Circuit's assertion that balancing is subject to deferential abuse-of-discretion review. 166"

Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",

The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information. None of this reasoning need be limited to the law enforcement privilege alone. The issue of adding confidentiality requirements to constrain other government secrecy powers is thus ripe for further scholarly contribution.",
