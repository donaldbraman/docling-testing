However, if tort law otherwise adequately accounts for these harms outside the damages remedy, then it could fairly protect individuals from the threat of premature death even in the absence of both criminal and tort liability. Put somewhat differently, although wrongful-death damages are neither fair nor full for the decedent right-holder, the tort right might nevertheless be constructed to fairly protect right-holders from bodily injury, including premature death. In that event, imperfect injury compensation via the damages remedy for wrongful death would influence the negligence rule's substantive formulation.

'But reasons are cheap.' Id. at 128. The more interesting question is whether deterrence supplies a decisive reason for formulating the duty in this manner. It does. In the absence of a compensatory remedy for fatal harms, their prevention must be the decisive reason for including them in the duty. Cf. id. at 140 & n.43 (arguing that 'duties to bear a deterrent burden' can be justified 'when we are under a moral duty to bear a burden, and the duty is one of sufficient importance that it may be enforced,' as can occur when 'compensation is not sufficient next best conformity to a duty not wrongfully to harm')."
