      "text": "Identity theft protection  laws, such  as the  Identity  Theft  and Assumption  Deterrence  Act  of  1998, 181 are  hard  to  apply  given  the difficulties with identifying perpetrators who are often located outside the U.S. While these laws are helpful in cases of celebrity impersonations, most consumer scams do not involve impersonation of the victim. For celebrity impersonator scams, celebrities are neither necessarily  incentivized  nor able to sue on the victims' behalf. In cases involving lay individuals, the FTC has pursued enforcement action against companies like Match.com for presenting fake profiles to entice users as a form of UX design for user recruitment  and  retention. 182   The  Match.com  case,  which  has  been pending for over five years, offers one opportunity for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to recognize platform liability for platform manipulation. 183"
