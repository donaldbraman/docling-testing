And the distinction still controls the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury. Whether a litigant in federal court has a right to a jury turns in part on whether a case would have been brought in a court of law or equity in 1791. This vestige of the law-equity divide applies and is enforced in all federal cases, including bankruptcy cases. Notably, however, the Seventh Amendment does not apply to cases in state court. A party litigating in state court is not entitled to a jury under the Seventh Amendment even if the case arose from federal substantive law. See Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U.S. 211, 223 (1916)."

See Brief of Ad Hoc Group of Local Councils of the Boy Scouts of America as Amicus Curiae Supporting Debtor Respondents, Purdue Pharma L.P. , 603 U.S. 204 (No. 23 -124), 2023 WL 7184149; Brief for the Boy Scouts of America as Amicus Curiae in Support of Respondent, Purdue Pharma L.P. , 603 U.S. 204 (No. 23 -124). The Court also received an application to stay the implementation of the plan of reorganization in the Boy Scouts of America bankruptcy pending the Court ' s decision in Purdue . See Application for a Stay of the Bankruptcy Plan Presently Being Implemented in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (No. 22-1237), Lujan Claimants v. Boy Scouts of Am., No. 23A741 (U.S. Feb. 5, 2024). Justice Alito had granted a temporary stay for the Court to consider that motion. See Order, Boy Scouts of Am. , No. 23A741 (U.S. Feb. 16, 2024) (Alito, J., in chambers). The Court denied the application six days later. See Order in Pending Case, Boy Scouts of Am. , No. 23A741 (U.S. Feb. 22, 2024). The Boy Scouts case was also mentioned during oral argument and around a dozen times in Justice Kavanaugh ' s dissent.

A victim who suffered $1 million in damages may be entitled to recover $1 million from either the debtor or a third party or both. But the victim is not entitled to recover more than $1 million in damages just because there might be two possible defendants. If the victim attempted to bring suit after fully recovering, the prior recovery would be a defense, and the case would be dismissed. And so, some courts have said that a bankruptcy court can release the victims ' claims against the nondebtor when the debtor ' s estate is providing full satisfaction of the claim (here, $1 million)."
