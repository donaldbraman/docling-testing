For a canonical modern formulation, see Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously 191 -92 (1977). To be sure, there were some Founding Era rights that were closer to absolutes, for instance because they were grounded in a speci /uniFB01 c positive law custom or because they were seen as inalienable. See Campbell, Natural Rights and the First Amendment , supra note 59, at 280 -90; see also William Baude & Stephen E. Sachs, The ' Common-Good Manifesto , ' 136 Harv. L.

The classical doctrines of judicial restraint rested on two institutional premises: one judicial and one legislative. 72 The judicial premise was that judicial review should be exercised with delicacy because taking a judgment out of the hands of the legislature was a matter of high stakes -with no easy way to correct a mistaken decision. That view remains true. The legislative premise was that legislatures took very seriously their obligations to the Constitution, and so legislation was only enacted after it had survived serious constitutional scrutiny. That premise is much more contestable and indeed often false today. 73",
      "text": "To be sure, doctrines of judicial deference have themselves evolved over time. The classical doctrines of judicial restraint rested on two institutional premises: one judicial and one legislative. 72 The judicial premise was that judicial review should be exercised with delicacy because taking a judgment out of the hands of the legislature was a matter of high stakes -with no easy way to correct a mistaken decision. That view remains true. The legislative premise was that legislatures took very seriously their obligations to the Constitution, and so legislation was only enacted after it had survived serious constitutional scrutiny. That premise is much more contestable and indeed often false today. 73"
