Although evidence of prolonged, severe domestic  abuse  could  operate  as  a  basis  to  exact  mercy  on  (i.e.,  reduce  or eliminate punishment for) a defendant, our legal system's acknowledgement of these  circumstances,  in  the  form  of  battered  woman  syndrome,  is  instead actualized as a way to calibrate just punishment. In particular, this Note explains the critical distinction between 'justice' and 'mercy' as defined by criminal law scholars, focusing on how battered woman syndrome-or battering and its effects-might fit into each category and exploring the ways in which battered woman  syndrome  evidence  has  been  adapted  to  fit  the  contours  of  our institutions as a justice practice rather than as a mercy practice. Additionally, this Note discusses several obstacles to battered woman syndrome's use as a vehicle for mercy in the courtroom as well as on an institutional level. Among these  obstacles  are  evidence  rules,  jury  instructions,  public  opinion,  and common misconceptions regarding domestic violence-and victims of domestic violence-which affect jury verdicts and clemency decisions for battered women defendants. Other scholars have surveyed the effectiveness of battered woman syndrome evidence at obtaining acquittals, critiqued the theory on psychological, jurisprudential, and feminist grounds, or evaluated its fit with self-defense  doctrine.  This  Note  analyzes  battered  woman  syndrome  from  a different angle, in the context of prevailing mercy theories, and compares its theoretical alignment  with  mercy  literature  to  its actual justice-oriented application in our criminal justice system. Further, this Note hypothesizes about the facets of our intuitions that account for the disparity between theoretical and practical applications of battered woman syndrome evidence and that prevent battered woman syndrome from being meaningfully realized as an institutional ground for mercy.",

Jurors were more swayed by factors that did not pertain to culpability-such as sympathy for the defendant's previous, undeserved suffering-in reaching a  decision  to  reduce  punishment  only  when  they  perceived  they  could rightfully do so. 74 This study highlights the way in which the use of battered woman syndrome to bolster a self-defense claim is strained. Battered woman syndrome testimony often does not meaningfully affect jurors' assessment of a defendant's culpability but may increase juror sympathy for the defendant. Further, it highlights that while jurors may develop some level of sympathy for a battered woman defendant in response to battered woman syndrome testimony, they do not utilize it in reaching a verdict unless given permission to do so. It follows that jury instructions that do not expressly afford jurors the authority to consider factors outside of a strict calculus of self-defense effectively  remove  any  opportunity  for  jurors  to  act  mercifully  to  reduce punishment out of a sense of compassion or benevolence.",
      "text": "and Sara Rzepa's study on the impact of battered woman syndrome expert testimony on jurors' decisions found that expert testimony on battering and its effects only resulted in more lenient verdicts when jurors were instructed on  jury  nullification. 71 That  is,  jurors  only  opted  to  reduce  or  eliminate punishment when they had been formally released from strictly applying the law  they  were  given. 72 This  reinforces  the  idea  that  battered  woman syndrome  testimony's  'impact  on  verdicts  did  not  appear  to  operate  by providing  participants  with  a  better  fit  between  her  actions  and  the  legal requirements  of  self-defense,'  and  instead  operated  'by  increasing  juror sympathy for the woman's case.' 73 In these instances, jurors extended mercy when given the chance to stray from strictly performing a justice function. Jurors were more swayed by factors that did not pertain to culpability-such as sympathy for the defendant's previous, undeserved suffering-in reaching a  decision  to  reduce  punishment  only  when  they  perceived  they  could rightfully do so. 74 This study highlights the way in which the use of battered woman syndrome to bolster a self-defense claim is strained. Battered woman syndrome testimony often does not meaningfully affect jurors' assessment of a defendant's culpability but may increase juror sympathy for the defendant. Further, it highlights that while jurors may develop some level of sympathy for a battered woman defendant in response to battered woman syndrome testimony, they do not utilize it in reaching a verdict unless given permission to do so. It follows that jury instructions that do not expressly afford jurors the authority to consider factors outside of a strict calculus of self-defense effectively  remove  any  opportunity  for  jurors  to  act  mercifully  to  reduce punishment out of a sense of compassion or benevolence."
