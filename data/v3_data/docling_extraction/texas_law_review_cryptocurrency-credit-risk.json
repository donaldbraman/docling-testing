Part I of the Article reviews the role of cryptocurrency  wallets and  exchanges  and  the  provisions in exchanges' user agreements regarding how customer funds are held. Part II examines  the  key  issues  confronting  cryptocurrency  customers  in  an exchange's bankruptcy. In particular, it considers whether the automatic stay would apply, whether custodial holdings would be considered property of the bankruptcy  estate,  whether  pre-bankruptcy  transfers  could  be  avoided  as preferences,  and  whether  exchange  customers  would  be  relegated  to  the status of general unsecured creditors. Part III considers the additional credit risk  that  investors  face  when  dealing  with  a  staged  cryptocurrency  wallet where there is no direct investor privity with the actual custodian. Part IV addresses the lack of cryptocurrency exchange regulation and the inadequacy of money transmitter regulation and private insurance. It suggests that the Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  is  the  agency  best  situated  under existing  legal  authorities  to  ensure  the  protection  of  exchange  customers' funds. The conclusion summarizes the nature of credit risk borne and not priced  by  cryptocurrency  exchange  customers,  and  the  moral  hazard  this unpriced risk creates for exchanges.",

If the payment is recorded on-chain, then the blockchain assumes part of the clearing function for  the  particular  cryptocurrency  associated  with  that  blockchain.  If  the payments going both ways are in crypto-for example, Moe sells his bitcoin for thirty dogecoins-then all the clearing will be done on the blockchain (if the transactions are recorded on-chain), but the bitcoin transfer will clear on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the dogecoin transfer will clear separately (and without coordination) on the Dogecoin blockchain. Because the transaction will clear through two separate and uncoordinated blockchains there is credit risk  in  the  transaction-the bitcoin transfer might go through, but not the reciprocal  dogecoin  transfer,  leaving  Moe  with  neither  a  bitcoin  nor  a dogecoin."

      "text": "b.  Application of Article 8 to Cryptocurrency .-Does Part 5 of Article 8 apply  to  cryptocurrency?  The  Article  8  system  of  title  immobilization  in Part 5 is based upon the creation of a 'security entitlement' for a person at a 'securities intermediary' that maintains 'securities accounts' for others. 159 The 'security entitlement' exists when a 'securities intermediary' credits another person's 'securities account' with a 'financial asset' on its books and records. 160 A 'securities account' is defined as an account to which a 'financial asset' may be credited. 161 In other words, a security entitlement requires  a  security  account,  which  in  turn  requires  there  to  be  a  financial asset.  Thus,  the  key  to  the  application  of  Article  8's  title  mobilization provision would seem to be whether an asset is a 'financial asset.'"

      "text": "313. Organization of  a  Trust  Company  for  the  Limited  Purpose  of  Exercising  of  Fiduciary Powers , supra note 310. It is unclear how a failed trust company would be resolved. One possibility would be a state bank insolvency proceeding. Another would be a federal bankruptcy proceeding, but it is unclear if a trust company is eligible to be a debtor in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code precludes  'banks'  from  being  debtors.  11  U.S.C.  § 109(b)(2).  Only  a  handful  of  cases  have addressed the question of whether a trust company qualifies as a 'bank' for purposes of eligibility for bankruptcy, but those cases have generally held that a trust company that does not engage in the core  business  of  banking-accepting  deposits-is  not  a  bank. E.g. ,  McKinney  v.  Jones  ( In  re Republic Fin. Corp.), 77 B.R. 282, 284-85 (N.D. Okla. 1987). Irrespective, for assets held in trust, the difference between the insolvency regimes is not likely to be material."

It would similarly be in the CFPB's regulatory ambit to extend a similar requirement to stablecoin issuers, mandating that the assets they hold to back their stablecoins be held in a bankruptcy-remote arrangement for the benefit of the stablecoin holders. The CFPB could also mandate disclosure of stablecoin reserves.
