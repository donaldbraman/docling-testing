Devex Corp. 50 made  it  clear  that  patent  damages  should  not  be  limited  without explicit congressional intent to do so. 51 Similarly, in Rite-Hite Corp. v.

Section 271(a) .-Most patent infringement cases involve an act of direct  infringement  under  § 271(a),  which  states  that  'whoever  without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during  the  term  of  the  patent  therefor,  infringes  the  patent.' 70 Unlike  the general damages provision of § 284, § 271(a) includes territorial language that  limits  the  scope  of  liability-only  acts  'within  the  United  States'  or importation 'into the United States' constitute direct infringement. 71 Of the three  cases  mentioned  previously,  two  fall  under  this  direct  infringement provision: Power  Integrations and Carnegie  Mellon .  Whereas  the  court considered the availability of lost profits in Power Integrations , Carnegie Mellon involved damages in the form of reasonable royalties. In both cases, a domestic act of infringement under § 271(a) resulted in harm to the patentee occurring outside of the United States. The question was whether such harm was compensable. 72",
      "text": "1.  Section 271(a) .-Most patent infringement cases involve an act of direct  infringement  under  § 271(a),  which  states  that  'whoever  without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during  the  term  of  the  patent  therefor,  infringes  the  patent.' 70 Unlike  the general damages provision of § 284, § 271(a) includes territorial language that  limits  the  scope  of  liability-only  acts  'within  the  United  States'  or importation 'into the United States' constitute direct infringement. 71 Of the three  cases  mentioned  previously,  two  fall  under  this  direct  infringement provision: Power  Integrations and Carnegie  Mellon .  Whereas  the  court considered the availability of lost profits in Power Integrations , Carnegie Mellon involved damages in the form of reasonable royalties. In both cases, a domestic act of infringement under § 271(a) resulted in harm to the patentee occurring outside of the United States. The question was whether such harm was compensable. 72"

The patent holder would still be entitled to the $2 million lost profits in Texas but would be unable to recover the $1 million lost profits in France. Thus, the net recovery (under the France scenario) is $2 million instead of the $3 million obtained from purely domestic lost profits. Yelderman notes:",
