      "text": "Of  course,  today's  major  social  media  platforms  likely  wouldn't expressly exclude members based on, say, race, sex, or sexual orientation. But consider a peculiar form of antidiscrimination law: bans on discrimination  in  places  of  public  accommodation  based  on  arrest  or conviction history. Ann Arbor categorically bans such discrimination based on arrest record. 136 Madison, Urbana, and Champaign do the same as to arrest record  or  conviction  record. 137 Connecticut  bans  discrimination  based  on expunged  criminal  records. 138 New  Jersey  bans  discrimination  based  on criminal  history  involving  possession,  distribution,  or  manufacturing  of marijuana or hashish. 139 Illinois, Hawaii, New York, and Wisconsin also ban such discrimination in employment, 140 so it's easy to imagine one of those states extending the ban to public accommodations."
