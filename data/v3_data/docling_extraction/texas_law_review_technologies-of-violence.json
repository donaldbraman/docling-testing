      "text": "In light of these challenges, policymakers who support the development of smart gun  technology  might  look  for  mechanisms  to  incentivize innovation. One such mechanism, as discussed in Part I, is public support in the form of prizes or grants. Between 1997 and 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice awarded more than $12 million in grants to develop smart gun technologies. 186 Some of this money went to established firearms manufacturers like Colt and Smith & Wesson, some to start-ups, and some to universities. 187 On  the back of this support, a number  of  firms demonstrated meaningful progress towards a marketable smart gun. A 2013 report  by  the  federal  government's  National  Institute  of  Justice  (NIJ) cataloged  the  technological  advances  already  made  by  several  firms  to develop reliable user authentication. 188"

According to the  NRA,  when  Smith  & Wesson entered an  agreement with the  Clinton administration to develop smart guns, it 'had run the white flag of surrender' to  the  government. 202 Colt's  efforts  faired  similarly,  with  both  companies experiencing  huge  sales  losses  because  of  their  purported  complicity  in government  overreach.  In  fact,  the  losses  were  so  staggering  that  both companies faced bankruptcy and were sold off. 203"
