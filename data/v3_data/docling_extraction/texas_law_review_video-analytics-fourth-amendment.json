Video analytics (also known as computer vision) involves hardware and software in cameras that turn video surveillance streams into useful data, identifying,  categorizing,  matching,  and  alerting  police  about  objects, people,  and  incidents.  Video  analytics  can  identify  objects  (e.g.,  hat, backpack,  person,  car)  and  track  that  person  or  thing  back  in  time  and through  the  streets  using  video  surveillance  footage.  For  police  officers conducting  virtual  patrols  or  retrospective  investigations,  video  analytics lets  police scan thousands of linked cameras for suspicious behavior or a particular suspect, thus drastically enhancing police surveillance power. The  Fourth  Amendment  question  is  whether  this  form  of  police investigation is a 'search,' violating a reasonable expectation of privacy. Traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine has long allowed video cameras in public under the theory that people have negligible expectations of privacy in public areas. The open question is whether a digital video analytics system that  allows  for  citywide  continuous  object  identification,  classification, matching, tracking, sorting, and storing of images changes the constitutional analysis. This Article argues that video analytics presents a different constitutional problem than traditional video surveillance. Properly understood, what is happening behind the scenes with video analytics should alter the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis. This Article builds upon recent Supreme Court cases to develop a theory for when digital surveillance becomes a Fourth Amendment search. The Article  also  uses  video  analytics  to  explore  the  limits  of  Fourth Amendment  doctrine.

In holding that the police needed a warrant to listen to Katz's conversation, the Supreme Court distinguished between the private nature of the phone call and Katz's public presence in the phone booth. 151 The Court held that a person could claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversation in a telephone booth because they had paid the toll to use the phone, but that they might not be able to claim an expectation of privacy from observations of their physical presence in the phone booth. 152 In  the  Court's  words,  'For  the  Fourth  Amendment  protects  people,  not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to  preserve  as  private,  even  in  an  area  accessible  to  the  public,  may  be constitutionally protected.' 153 In other words, it might be reasonable to think that one's phone call was not being listened to by police, but anyone (even police) could see someone using the phone with their own two eyes.",

Predictive  suspicion  systems  raise  real  concerns  with  error,  bias,  and  equity  (in investigation  and  at  trial).  The  preprogrammed  suspicion  prompts  are  developed  outside  the policing context by private developers, and might not take into account issues of economic, social, or racial differences. See Eric Lander & Alondra Nelson, Americans Need a Bill of Rights for an AI-Powered World , WIRED (Oct. 8, 2021, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-bill-ofrights-artificial-intelligence/ [https://perma.cc/45K7-43PA] (discussing how algorithms may inadvertently import the biases of the training sets they use); Zewe, supra note 46. In addition, it is difficult to determine ex ante what is going to be deemed 'suspicious' in the future. Almost all data driven testimony suffers from this inherent bias that confuses technology with objectivity.  Roth , supra , at 2007."
