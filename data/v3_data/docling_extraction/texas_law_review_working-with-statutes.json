      "text": "29.  The relationship between laws made in the past and people governed by them in the present is an enduringly complex aspect of democratic governance. On the one hand, one can sense that '[w]e are indebted to those who came before us, for it is through their efforts that the world of culture we inhabit now exists,' giving social participants 'a duty to respect and to conserve the achievements of their predecessors.' Anthony T. Kronman, Precedent and Tradition , 99 YALE L.J. 1029, 1057, 1067 (1990). On the other, one can declare independence: 'by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independant nation to another.' Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (Sept. 6, 1789), in 15 THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 392, 395 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1958). Intermediating institutions can help find balance between the two: 'the judge in shaping the rules of law must heed the mores of his day.' BENJAMIN N. CARDOZO, THE NATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS 103-05 (1921). Even more so, we argue, can the agency, which is particularly suited  to  addressing  'polycentric'  problems. See Lon  L.  Fuller, The  Forms  and  Limits  of Adjudication , 92 HARV. L. REV. 353, 394-95, 398 (1978) (explaining the concept of polycentric tasks, which are best resolved by 'managerial direction')."
