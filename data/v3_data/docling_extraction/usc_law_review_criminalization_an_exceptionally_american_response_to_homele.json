That is, it does not take law as an isolated field that can (or should) be studied on its own, or with a mere dash of policy analysis  thrown  in  at  the  end.  Rather,  it  sees  law  as  embedded  in  and determined by social context. Such a strategy, according to some, has been described as 'the single most revolutionary development in modern legal thought.' 15 This is not to say that all legal research must consider law this way. Rather, it is to say that doing so is useful and worthwhile , one of many forms that legal analysis and thought can take. Thus, while not all analysis in  this  Note  is directly legal,  the  consequences  of  the  ideology  and governmental policies outlined in this Note are directly legal, manifesting in municipal  decisions to criminalize homelessness  and  court decisions responding thereto. In addition to the strictly legal arguments made below, another  contribution  of  this  Note  is  an  analysis  of what  motivates recent American  legal  trends.  Such  an  analysis  is  imperative  not  only  for understanding and evaluating current trends, but also for analyzing the root causes  and  offering  solutions  in  domains  that  extend  outside  of  law  yet influence law, such as notions about what has to change in popular American political  ideology.  When  legal  arguments  go  hand-in-hand  with  political arguments, since law is always bound up with politics, 16 they become all the more potent. As such, this Note takes an approach that is interdisciplinary and necessarily so.",

Americans were more likely to value freedom over equality than those in other western democracies surveyed. 43 More specifically, Americans were more likely to believe that the freedom to pursue life's goals outweighed the importance of the state guaranteeing that no one is in need. 44 While the percentage of people favoring this statement was roughly 25% in France and 31% in Germany, it was over 60% in the United States. 45 Additionally, almost 50% of Americans in one survey thought that 'it should not be the responsibility of government to reduce income differences.' 46 Amongst the other countries included in the survey, only New Zealand scored higher, and did so only by a small margin. The analogous proportion in most other western democracies was far lower. In  another  poll,  the  percentage  of  Americans  surveyed  who  thought  that private  ownership  of  business  is  preferable  to  government  ownership  of business was  over 60%,  higher than any other  western  democracy surveyed. 47 The analogous figures for Germany, Australia, and Canada were roughly 38%, 39%, and 52%.

      "text": "countries. 42 Their analysis was enlightening. America was an outlier relative to other western democracies in a variety of ways. Americans were more likely to value freedom over equality than those in other western democracies surveyed. 43 More specifically, Americans were more likely to believe that the freedom to pursue life's goals outweighed the importance of the state guaranteeing that no one is in need. 44 While the percentage of people favoring this statement was roughly 25% in France and 31% in Germany, it was over 60% in the United States. 45 Additionally, almost 50% of Americans in one survey thought that 'it should not be the responsibility of government to reduce income differences.' 46 Amongst the other countries included in the survey, only New Zealand scored higher, and did so only by a small margin.

      "text": "Obviously,  the  people  who  experience  homelessness  are  those  in poverty. Along these lines, Black and Latino people are already overrepresented, with roughly 20.1% of Black folks living in poverty in the United  States  today,  despite  being  only  13.5%  of  the  population. 65 The respective numbers for Latino folks are 28.4% and 19.3%. 66 But the numbers are even more exacerbated when it comes to homelessness. While 24.1% of homeless people are Latino, a staggering 37.3% of homeless people identify as Black. 67 Thus, the intersection of homelessness and race, at least for Black folks, is not merely equivalent to that of poverty and race. Rather, homeless people are disproportionately Black at a rate even more extreme than that of poverty."

Indeed, America's response to homelessness exhibits precisely the kind of response  we  would  expect  if  this  were  the  case.  Racism,  individual  and structural, is therefore not only responsible for Black people disproportionately becoming homeless, but also for their remaining homeless. The unwillingness to build homeless shelters and the tendency to blame people for the economic circumstances, which is exacerbated by the history  of  racial  oppression  and  division  in  the  United  States,  makes America's response to homelessness much more understandable (though not justifiable).  Thus,  the  empathy  deficit  and  tendency  to  blame  racial minorities-particularly Black folks-for their actions and economic status intensifies America's lackluster response to homelessness. 91"

Rather  than  engaging  with  it  substantively,  the opinion argues that the standard is somehow not clear enough, since it may be difficult to count the number of homeless people on any given night and because it may be difficult for cities to estimate the number of shelter beds available  and  build  adequate  housing. 140 All  the  analysis  really  shows, however, is that many cities have not made good-faith efforts to comply with the  ruling.  Rather,  cities  have  routinely  crafted  threadbare  policies  to 'comply' in appearance only with the requirements set forth in Boise , then been challenged in court when their policies are shown for what they are, then complained to the courts that the standards are unworkable using their own ineptitude as the evidence.

The  Court  states clearly  that  '[t]he  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments Clause focuses on the question what 'method or kind of punishment' a government may impose after a criminal conviction, not on the question whether a government may criminalize  particular  behavior  in  the  first  place  or  how  it  may  go  about securing a conviction for that offense.' 142 This language leaves no room for Robinson ,  since  that  ruling  did  place  substantive  limits  on  what  could  be punished. The Court states that it does not overrule Robinson because no party  argued  for  it  to  do  so. 143 Instead,  it  emphasizes  that  Grants  Pass's ordinance nominally criminalizes the act of camping rather than the act of being  homeless.  Responding  to  the  argument  that  those  acts  inevitably follow  from  a  status,  the  Court  relies  on  the  plurality  in Powell ,  not discussing the argument that being intoxicated in public as an alcoholic is"
