Fair use does this by improving the bargaining power of users and giving them leverage or a threat point vis-à-vis copyright owners.",

Obviously, not all of them would win a fair use ruling in court, but each can credibly argue in negotiations with copyright owners that their use would be found fair with a certain probability. Since transformativeness, as recently established by the Supreme Court, 'is a matter of degree,' 11 the level of transformativeness can be represented on a unit interval, essentially reflecting its probability of enjoying a fair use defense. This probability, in turn, immediately translates into licensing leverage when negotiating with a monopolistic rightsholder."

Since the monopolistic price is higher than the competitive price, it works to transfer wealth from consumers to the monopolist. Monopolistic pricing, in other words, allows monopolists to capture consumer surplus. 144 To see this, let's return to the above example, and consider a consumer who values the good at $22. Recall that the monopolist sets the price at $20, whereas in a competitive  market,  the  price  of  the  good  would  be  $12.  Under  perfect competition the consumer would have paid $12 for the good, thus deriving a surplus of $10 ( $22 - $12 ) from the transaction. Under monopolistic pricing the surplus of the consumer shrinks to $2 ( $22 - $20 ), with the $8 lost to the consumer being transferred to the monopolist-all relative to a competitive market.",
      "text": "Perhaps  even  more  worrisome  than  its  adverse  effect  on  allocative efficiency is the distributional inequities imposed by monopolistic pricing. Since the monopolistic price is higher than the competitive price, it works to transfer wealth from consumers to the monopolist. Monopolistic pricing, in other words, allows monopolists to capture consumer surplus. 144 To see this, let's return to the above example, and consider a consumer who values the good at $22. Recall that the monopolist sets the price at $20, whereas in a competitive  market,  the  price  of  the  good  would  be  $12.  Under  perfect competition the consumer would have paid $12 for the good, thus deriving a surplus of $10 ( $22 - $12 ) from the transaction. Under monopolistic pricing the surplus of the consumer shrinks to $2 ( $22 - $20 ), with the $8 lost to the consumer being transferred to the monopolist-all relative to a competitive market."
