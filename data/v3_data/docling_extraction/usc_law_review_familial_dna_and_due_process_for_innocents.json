In close cases, the respective scopes of competing constitutional rights should be defined so as to not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Article argues against any ban on, or categorical constitutional or statutory rule requiring, probable cause for law enforcement to conduct familial DNA searches.  The  privacy  interests  raised  by  critics  are  legitimate;  yet  the functional inability for law enforcement to identify unknown suspects due to"

Part Two presents the Fourth Amendment background to this problem  and  summarizes  the  argument  that  courts  should  recognize  a reasonable expectation of privacy that would prohibit warrantless familial DNA searches, even where DTC users give consent. Part Two also asserts that while this argument is colorable, it is weak.

Part Four concludes that, in close cases, competing constitutional rights must not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Part argues against any categorical rule substantially preventing law enforcement from conducting familial DNA searches. While legislatures are well-advised to limit the use of this technology to serious cases in which other investigative techniques have failed, they should not adopt bans or probable cause requirements; if they do, they should at least create an explicit process for defense subpoenas.

Even the strongest view of Brady emerging from the case law only requires the government  to  run  searches  within  CODIS,  which  includes  governmentcontrolled databases. As a practical matter, however, the very existence of Brady doctrine renders consumer databases a powerful and promising new source of exculpatory evidence for criminal defendants. Brady requires that law  enforcement  turn  over  evidence  of  potentially  culpable  third  parties generated by the familial DNA searches they conduct. Thus, preventing law enforcement  from  accessing  consumer  databases  without  probable  cause effectively deprives innocent defendants of critical exculpatory evidence."
