Regulatory entrepreneurship capitalizes on the pacing problem, seeking to grow 'too big to ban' before the law catches up. But it is not inevitable that the law will fall  hopelessly  behind  technological  development.  Ultimately,  refusing  to apply  the  law  to  a  technology  until  after  it  is  fully  developed  and entrenched-and  then  crafting  accommodative  laws  that  treat  the  extant incarnation of technology-based business models as inevitable-is a choice.

      "text": "While the strategy of regulatory entrepreneurship is not exclusive to technology-based businesses, 107 it  is  most commonly associated with VCfunded startups. 108 Part  of  the  explanation  for  this  lies  in  the  asymmetric incentive  structures  of  VC  funders,  who  face  little  legal  liability  for encouraging their portfolio companies to break the law but stand to capture a significant part of any upside from regulatory entrepreneurship strategies. 109 But it is also true that regulatory entrepreneurship is enabled by techno-solutionist narratives that make it particularly difficult for lawmakers and regulators to proactively rein in tech-related legal breaches.

One use case for APIs is to increase the speed of payments processing  by  making  it  easier  for  different  systems  to  share  payments data. 266 However, APIs are not just more efficient at passing desired data between systems-they may potentially be very efficient at passing along problems as well.
