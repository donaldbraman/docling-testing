For example, suppose that political appointees pressured  civil  servant  scientists  in  an  agency  to  bury  or  skew  research findings that cast doubt on the feasibility of a presidential initiative. In the short  run,  such  intimidation  might  prevent  the  public  from  hearing  the unvarnished views of scientists on an electorally salient matter. In the longer run, the pressure campaign-particularly if it were not an isolated incidentmight drive highly qualified scientists from the affected agency and deter others from serving in the first place.

The  prosecutors  who  exercise  this awesome discretion are selected and can be removed by a President, whom the  people  have  trusted  enough  to  elect.' 80 Justice  Scalia's  vision  of accountability was so narrow that he treated the IC provisions, enacted by elected members of Congress and subject to presidential veto, as constitutionally  intolerable  because  they  might  subject  the  president  and their advisers to popular scrutiny. The provisions, Scalia said, 'weaken[] the Presidency  by  reducing  the  zeal  of  his  staff'  and  'enfeeble[]  him  more directly in his constant confrontations with Congress, by eroding his public support.' 81",
