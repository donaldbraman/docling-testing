But what does it mean to say that a person's news inputs are balanced or symmetrical? Does it require equal shares of data that support Republican and Democratic talking points? What if one of those parties is more  likely  than  the  other  to  lean  on  false  empirical  claims?  Should  a balanced informational diet reflect or discount for such a lean? How are the problems of misinformation or distorted information to be addressed? Is it part of a balanced informational diet to receive a certain amount of 'fake news'? These questions admit of no easy answers. Rather, they suggest that the concern with filter bubbles trades on a notion of balance that is hard to cash  out  in  practice  without  difficult  anterior  ideological  and  political choices."
