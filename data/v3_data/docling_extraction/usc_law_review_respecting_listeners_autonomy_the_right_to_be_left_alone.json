      "text": "One further point about the right to speak that should be a given: the right to free speech under the First Amendment must incorporate a right to generally choose one's audience (though, of course, like any other right, this right  is  not  absolute  and  might  be  outweighed  by  a  sufficiently  strong governmental interest). The right to choose an audience is implicit in the Court's standard test to evaluate content-neutral 'time, place, or manner' regulations, which requires inter alia that any regulation 'leave open ample alternative channels of  communication.' 4 If such 'ample alternative channels' referred to the ability to speak to any audience, the test would have no teeth at all-and that is not the case, as illustrated by numerous cases. 5 Furthermore, in the leading case dealing with expressive conduct, a topic closely related to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the second Justice Harlan also went out of his way to state that he would not uphold a regulation of conduct with an 'incidental' impact on expression if the law 'in practice has the effect of entirely preventing a 'speaker' from reaching a significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate.' 6"

(Whether  universities  have  a  legal  obligation  to  protect victims from such speech is, of course, a different matter.) On the other hand, to the extent that claims of harassment are rooted in slogans yelled during protests such as 'From the River to the Sea,' which many people consider antisemitic, or the allegedly antisemitic content of signs, this is classic oneto-many speech which cannot be condemned purely because of its unwanted nature;  indeed,  at  least  with  respect  to  public  universities  silencing  such speech,  it  would  almost  certainly  constitute  viewpoint  discrimination  in violation of the First Amendment. The same would be true even regarding calls  for  genocide  that  Republican  members  of  Congress  such  as  Elise Stefanik complained about, 102 since such calls surely would not qualify as unprotected incitement under the stringent test of Brandenburg v. Ohio . 103 After all, for better or for worse, there is no 'awful speech' exception to the First Amendment.",
      "text": "Consider  also  harassment  litigation  arising  out  of  campus  protests regarding the Gaza war, 100 or complaints by members of Congress that by failing  to  control  such  protests  campuses  permitted  harassment  of  Jewish students. 101 Insofar  as  these  harassment  claims  are  rooted  in  one-to-one speech,  such  as  following  students  around  and  yelling  slurs  or  otherwise directing hostile speech at individual students who have demanded to be left alone, the First Amendment under the above analysis provides no protection to  such  speech.  (Whether  universities  have  a  legal  obligation  to  protect victims from such speech is, of course, a different matter.) On the other hand, to the extent that claims of harassment are rooted in slogans yelled during protests such as 'From the River to the Sea,' which many people consider antisemitic, or the allegedly antisemitic content of signs, this is classic oneto-many speech which cannot be condemned purely because of its unwanted nature;  indeed,  at  least  with  respect  to  public  universities  silencing  such speech,  it  would  almost  certainly  constitute  viewpoint  discrimination  in violation of the First Amendment. The same would be true even regarding calls  for  genocide  that  Republican  members  of  Congress  such  as  Elise Stefanik complained about, 102 since such calls surely would not qualify as unprotected incitement under the stringent test of Brandenburg v.
