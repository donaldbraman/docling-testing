In both Emami and Assarsson ,  there  was  no  'formal  charge'  listed  in  the  U.S.Sweden and U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany treaties to find that a relator might be extraditable, and as such, the requirement that there be 'formal charges'  in  the  foreign  jurisdiction  before  the  foreign  country  filed  an extradition request was not a necessary requirement to find that the relators were extraditable. 128 The court utilized these cases even though neither case dealt with a 'charging document' requirement. In Toledo's case, the court found that 'the Treaty does not mention formal charges or the Orden de Enjuiciamiento anywhere. And the requirement of a 'copy of the charging document'-which specifies no particular document-does not define the level  of  formality  [they]  should  read  into  'charged  with.'
