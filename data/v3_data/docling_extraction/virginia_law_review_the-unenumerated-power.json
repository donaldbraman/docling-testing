Proceeding chronologically, Part II builds on recent advances in historical research, showing how the corporate power was drafted into the Constitution and illuminating the early legal parameters of the corporate power. As Part II shows, contemporaneous legal sources and the transcripts of the Constitutional Convention make clear that the Framers understood federal incorporation as a distinct legal power. There was no confusion that the power to incorporate was part of another field nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between 'constructions' and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648-54 (2013)."

See Hurst, supra note 190, at 9; Wood, Empire, supra note 33, at 465-66; Horwitz, supra note 33, at 111 -14. As a result, literature discussing both the origins of corporate law and American history more broadly usually presumes that the only corporate development of any significance occurred at the state level. See, e.g., Maier, supra note 169, at 52; Menand & Ricks, supra note 33, at 1361-62 (observing this phenomenon); Winkler, supra note 2, at 3. But see Link & Maggor, supra note 190, at 270-72, 293-97 (providing an important recent critique of this narrative)."

      "text": "Osborn ,  however, expressly included language indicating that the charter of the Second Bank was likely sufficient for federal jurisdiction 'arising under' under the Constitution even if  it  had  no  'sue  and  be  sued'  clause.  22  U.S.  (9 Wheat.)  at  807,  823-24  (noting  the hypothetical of a bank charter and also asking rhetorically whether 'a being, thus constituted, [has]  a  case  which  does  not  arise  literally,  as  well  as  substantially,  under  the  law').  This broader inference has never been overturned. In fact, the Court has gone out of its way to preserve it. Am. Nat'l Red Cross v. S.G., 505 U.S. 247, 251 n.3 (1992) (expressly declining to address federal jurisdiction based on the federal nature of the corporate charter and deciding the case on other grounds); see also Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Fin. Corp., 306 U.S. 381, 394 (1939) (constructively finding federal jurisdiction without a 'sue and be sued' clause based on '[t]he legal position' of the entity)."
