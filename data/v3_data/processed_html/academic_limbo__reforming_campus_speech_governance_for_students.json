Students, however, must rely on malleable university policies interpreted by the very administrators restricting their speech. At private institutions beyond Constitutional reach, this power imbalance proves especially acute. When Columbia dismantled protest encampments or Harvard struggled to balance competing speech interests, students found themselves without meaningful recourse to challenge these decisions. 3",

The consequences of speech-related sanctions also weigh more heavily on students. While the contract relationship between the private university and student permits legal action, 11 students rarely succeed because courts typically defer to institutional policy interpretations.

Student speech on campus faces various interferences, from prior restraints to ongoing shutdowns and post-event discipline. While discipline activates remedy procedures, speech shutdowns and prior restraints rarely trigger review processes. The recent Gaza protests at universities demonstrate this gap perfectly. Without formal sanctions, administrators bypass reviewing their interventions. Furthermore, even when sanctions follow ‘disruptive’ speech, no independent body evaluates whether these actions serve educational purposes or align with institutional principles. Reviews focus solely on disciplinary correctness, ignoring speech intervention legitimacy.

The success of these reforms will ultimately depend on institutional willingness to accept meaningful constraints on administrative discretion, recognizing that true commitment to academic freedom requires governance structures that protect student expression rights even when that expression proves uncomfortable or challenging.
