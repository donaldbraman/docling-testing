      "text": "In an era of reckoning and resistance, this Symposium Piece journeys through the rich terrain of Black protest and Afrofuturist imagination, uncovering a radical legal tradition rooted in historical defiance and visionary possibility. By analyzing Black resistance—from insurrections against slavery to today’s racial justice movements—through an Afrofuturist lens, it identifies three key dimensions of Black protest in the United States: perversion, subversion, and revolution. The Piece begins by contextualizing Black protest within the founding contradiction of American freedom—a nation proclaiming liberty while bound to the yoke of slavery. It charts the evolution of protest rights in early American jurisprudence, revealing how legal interpretations narrowed those rights, particularly for Black Americans. From there, it turns to the philosophical foundations of Black protest, highlighting the right of rev-olution and the moral duty to resist injustice. The seeds of Afrofuturist thought emerge in the writings of nineteenth-century Black activists like David Walker, Martin R. Delany, and Frederick Douglass, who envisioned alternative futures centered on Black liberation. As these visions unfold, the Piece connects the Black radical protest tradition to modern movements like Black Lives Matter, highlighting Afrofuturism’s role in reimagining law, society, and racial justice. By combining legal analysis, historical research, and literary criticism, this Piece reveals a distinctly Black radical vision of protest law—one that frames protest as not merely a right but a moral imperative. Ultimately, it contends that protest is more than a catalyst for change. It is the heartbeat of democratic society.",

Close These acts offered alternative visions of freedom, challenging legal and political structures that silenced Black voices and upheld a liberal republi­canism rooted in White supremacy. As Black protest traditions emerged, they directly contested the narrow legal concept of protest inherited from English common law, a tradition that recognized only limited rights to pe­tition the government for grievances. 12 12 See Katherine Hessler, Early Efforts to Suppress Protest: Unwanted Abolitionist Speech, 7 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 185, 186 (1998) (noting that in 1836, Congress attempted to “quiet abolitionist dissention and limit their use of petition by passing a gag rule . . . forbid­ding legislators from discussing or receiving petitions from citizens regarding the issues of slavery and abolition”); see also A Necessary Evil?

Close In the twentieth century, Afrofuturism emerged as a powerful intellectual and artistic tra­dition, seizing upon the contradictions of American protest to envision alternative Black futures beyond the margins of the law. 19 19 See Mark Bould, The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF, 34 Sci. Fiction Stud. 177, 178–80 (2007) (critiquing early science fiction works as “avoid[ing] direct engagement with the realities of racialized hierarchies and oppressions” and discussing Afrofuturism’s impact on twentieth-century science fiction). ...
