In the 1990s, policymakers settled upon the current asylum adjudication system for cost-saving and efficiency reasons. They believed that the Asylum Office would quickly grant meritorious asylum cases and refer frivolous or complicated cases to immigration court for further adjudication. They imagined affirmative grant rates would climb because quick adjudications by AOs and other features of the new system would discourage the filing of frivolous applications. Speedy grants at the Asylum Office would save money by reserving immigration judge (IJ) time for difficult cases. Creating a professional corps of AOs would also increase the quality and consistency of decision-making in the asylum system.",

For example, sociologist Talia Shiff has studied how AOs negotiate situations where codified asylum law conflicts with their belief of a given asylum seekers’ moral deservingness for immigration relief. Shiff also observes how AOs apply the ambiguous “particular social group” ground of asylum.[41]Other scholars have similarly studied discrete aspects of affirmative asylum adjudication. This scholarship includes an empirical study of the Asylum Office’s application of the one-year filing deadline;[42]another study exploring when AOs exercise their discretion to provide interpreters and how interpreters can impact asylum interviews;[43]and a case study examining the Boston Asylum Office’s unusually low asylum grant rates.[44]Published in 2014, the most comprehensive study of the affirmative asylum system provides an empirical analysis of AO asylum decisions over a fourteen-year period.[45]Even so, no scholar has evaluated whether the reformed affirmative asylum system has lived up to policymakers’ goals.

I argue that the United States should adopt a framework for group-based asylum claims, and adjudicate more claims based on paper applications. To ensure adjudications are faithful to the law and consistent across offices and interviews are conducted in a truly non-adversarial manner, I recommend hiring more qualified adjudicators and inviting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to monitor adjudications. Further, for the new system to work, increasing legal representation for asylum seekers is crucial. Finally, to protect the politically fragile asylum system, I argue for creating new pathways for legal migration.

For example, Gustavo spent five years in proceedings before he was granted asylum by an IJ.[358]This delay leads to prolonged family separation because many asylum seekers are forced to leave their families behind, and they cannot petition to bring over family members until they receive a grant of asylum and all appeals by DHS have been decided.[359]While they wait to be reunited in the United States, family members may live in danger.[360]Asylum seekers commonly suffer from mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, and anxiety. Moreover, the stress of family separation and prolonged waits for relief may hinder their recovery from these disorders.[361]For instance, one asylum seeker, who waited years for their decision, described the wait as akin to “living behind bars.”[362]",

Am. Immigr. Council, CBP One: An Overview 2 (2023), https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/cbp_one_an_overview_0.pdf[https://perma.cc/HQC6-4JMR]. However, this bar would not apply if the noncitizen made an appointment for processing through the CBP One mobile application (“CBP One app”).Id.In January 2025, the Trump Administration shut down the CBP One app, cutting off access to asylum for asylum seekers at the southern border in expedited removal.

      "text": "[241]. This Section, and the ones that follow, demonstrate how Bijal Shah’s theory of “administrative subordination” applies to the affirmative asylum system. Accounts of discrimination or bias in the administrative state are often “understood to be the result of individualized bureaucratic discrimination.” Bijal Shah,Administrative Subordination,91 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1603, 1606 (2024). However, Shah argues that administrative injuries, such as those committed by the immigration system against noncitizens, are more than just “the result of bureaucratic bias alone.” Rather, “[i]nstitutional systems. . .have led to problematic administrative policies and outcomes.”Id.at 1608. Administrative agencies prioritize institutional interests, such as efficiency, cost-saving, reducing burdens, and preserving resources, “as a matter of discretion, with the understanding that doing so is beneficial to administration.”Id.at 1610. However, these same interests can harm marginalized communities.Id.at 1612. Shah “refers to the interplay between bureaucratic institutional priorities and harm to minorities as ‘administrative subordination’” and provides examples of how this phenomenon happens in the administration of immigration law.Id.at 1613. For example, ICE uses arrest records for efficiency and cost-saving to determine who to place in removal proceedings “even if the targeted noncitizens were never convicted of a crime, because arrest records serve as inexpensive and accessible proxies for immigration data that would be more difficult and expensive to identify with greater precision.”Id.at 1614. Similarly, in this Part, I show how institutional goals of the Asylum Office—such as efficiency, cost-saving, fraud detection and national security—have been applied on the ground by AOs in ways that harm asylum seekers.SeeinfraPart III.A–H.",

Many courts have denied mandamus actions because they “have recognized the immense backlog with which USCIS must deal and have noted that granting relief to a particular plaintiff simply allows [them] to ‘leapfrog[] other asylum applicants, and undermin[e] USCIS’s reasons for implementing the LIFO system.’” Youssef Mohamed, Comment,Here’s Your Number, Now Please Wait in Line: The Asylum Backlog, Federal Court Litigation, and Artificial Intelligence in Agency Adjudication, 89 U. Chi. L. Rev. 2013, 2030 (2022) (alteration in original) (quoting Yu Liu v. Wolf, 19 Civ. 410, 2020 WL 2836426, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2020)). However, USCIS does sometimes agree to schedule asylum interviews in response to mandamus actions.See, e.g., MillerlawDC,supranote 28 (granting an asylum interview after the attorney filed mandamus for an asylum seeker who waited for five years); Wildes & Weinberg, P.C.,supranote 28 (granting an asylum interview after an attorney filed mandamus for an asylum seeker who waited for two years);Afghan People Seeking Asylum Reach Landmark Settlement with U.S. Government in Class Action, Nat’l Immigrant Just.

For an argument about why federal court mandamus litigation is not the best way to resolve delayed affirmative asylum interviews, see Mohamed,supranote 345, at 2030–39, 2043–53 (arguing that courts are not competent to decide “whether an agency’s prioritization of tasks and allocation of resources are ‘correct’ or ‘reasonable’” and that mandamus actions raise serious separation of powers issues; instead, the author proposes an AI solution to provide particularly vulnerable asylum seekers with a way to expedite their asylum interviews).",

Dist. of New York, Brooklyn Attorneys Sentenced for Asylum Fraud Scheme (May 31, 2023), https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/brooklyn-attorneys-sentenced-asylum-fraud-scheme [https://perma.cc/7CFS-A6JC] (sentencing two licensed immigration attorneys to prison for an asylum fraud scheme). In these instances, the noncitizens were clearly aware of the fraud. But in other cases, applicants are also defrauded. Under one scheme, known as the “10-Year Green Card/Visa Scam,” attorneys or unauthorized practitioners inform noncitizens that they can receive work authorization because they have been in the United States for ten years or because they have a relative who is a U.S. citizen.

They ask the individual to sign a form but do not tell them that it is an asylum application.Id.When the noncitizen fails to appear at the asylum interview, they are placed in removal proceedings. In some cases, the attorney withdraws the asylum application and files for a form of relief known as cancellation of removal for non-permanent residents (which does require ten years of physical presence but also requires proof of “extreme, unusual, and exceptional hardship” to a qualifying family member, a difficult standard to meet).Id.Because of the prevalence of the scam, the DOJ’s fraud and abuse prevention program warns noncitizens about it, and the Asylum Office reserves days (in some instances once every week) to interview (and usually quickly refer) applicants who have filed for asylum more than ten years after their arrival in the country.Id.;Ahmed, Crim & Rafsanjani,supranote 1, at 28.",
