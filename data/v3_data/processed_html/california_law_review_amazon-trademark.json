Amazon’s Brand Registry serves as a shadow trademark system that dramatically affects businesses’ incentives to seek legal registration of their marks. The result has been a surge in the number of applications to register, which has swamped the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and created delays for all applicants, even those that previously would have registered their marks. And the increased value of federal registration has drawn in bad actors who fraudulently register marks that are in use by others on the Amazon platform and use those registrations to extort the true owners.",

And the same Amazon policies have given rise to the phenomenon of “nonsense marks,” which are strings of letters and numbers unrecognizable as words or symbols. In the midst of these systemic changes, Amazon has consolidated its own branding practices, focusing on a few core brands and expanding its use of those marks across a wide range of products. In combination, Amazon’s business model and Brand Registry have overhauled the American trademark system, and they have done so with very little public recognition of the consequences of Amazon’s business approach.",

Likewise, the benefits of a reduction in the power of brands depend on whether alternative search tools, particularly algorithms that focus on product information and consumer reviews, convey relevant information to consumers as effectively as trademarks.

Now, businesses can capitalize on consumers using generic or descriptive terms as search terms, even when those consumers are not looking for any particular provider of goods or services.[228]Indeed, courts have sometimes recognized the competitive advantage that highly descriptive marks have in these search listings—marks like 24 HOUR FITNESS for a gym that is always open,[229]1-800 CONTACTS for contact lenses,[230]HOME-MARKET.COM for homeowner referral services,[231]and BOOKING.COM for travel booking services.[232]",

Nonsense marks do not provide any information about the goods or services and do not have any other ordinary meaning.[258]But fanciful terms are generally considered especially strong trademarks because they are assumed to be understandable only as trademarks.[259]Nonsense marks flout that assumption because they are not comprehensible as trademarks or, for that matter, as anything at all.",

Consumers often recognize that a sign is a trademark when it is located in a prototypical “trademark space,” even if they have not previously encountered that mark, but signs used in other places may not be understood by consumers as trademarks at all.[263]Nonsense marks likely do not function as marks, but the reason is their intrinsic nature, not that they do not indicate source when used in a particular manner.

What policy makers who seek insulation want to avoid are particular pitfalls of politicization, such as pressures that prioritize narrow short-term interests at the expense of long-term public welfare.”[393]This concern suggests taking a hard look at the substantive ways in which the trademark system’s operation has changed and exploring whether any of those changes are out of line with the way the trademark system ought to operate.[394]We return to that constellation of issues shortly in discussing trademark-specific harms provoked by Amazon.",

Trademark law assumes that businesses will use the trademark system in certain ways. Amazon has upended many of those assumptions, leaving the PTO and other legal actors ill-equipped to deal with the kinds of applications many businesses now file. For example, consider applications for descriptive or generic terms that businesses operating on Amazon might be tempted to seek.[398]For well-considered reasons, the trademark system makes it harder, if not impossible, to obtain protection for rights in these terms because of the impact that protection can have on fair competition.[399]It is much easier to register descriptive or generic terms if they are stylized or accompanied by an image.[400]Indeed, the PTO might very well require an applicant to disclaim rights in the descriptive or generic term itself.[401]",

For example, the Second Circuit found no likelihood of confusion between the PARENTS magazine and PARENT’S DIGEST magazine trademarks in part because the PARENTS registration “protect[ed] not the name or the word ‘parents,’ but rather the stylized logo of that name including the unusual form and shape of the letters comprising the word,” and thus did not prevent others’ use of the generic term “parent.”[402]Yet Amazon’s brand registry rules are not similarly sensitive because Amazon ignores stylization and accompanying images, focusing only on the text of a registered mark. Functionally speaking, Amazon will allow a descriptive or generic term to be the basis for protection and preferential treatment,[403]which means that the as-applied trademark system has a different character on Amazon: Amazon lacks the ability to meter scope in the way that justifies registration of these terms in the first place.",

In many ways, this insight is a bookend to Lina Khan’s influential work arguing that Amazon’s conduct violates antitrust laws (and the recent antitrust lawsuit brought against Amazon by the Federal Trade Commission under Khan’s leadership). David McCabe,U.S. Accuses Amazon of Illegally Protecting Monopoly in Online Retail, N.Y. Times (Sept. 26, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/ftc-amazon.html [https://perma.cc/A43K-RT3H]. Khan seeks to reorient antitrust law for the platform era, suggesting that reorientation is actually a return to antitrust law’s founding principles, by proposing that antitrust analysis focus on “the underlying structure and dynamics of markets” rather than consumer welfare measured through “short-term effects on price and output.” Khan,Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,supranote 1, at 716–17. In particular, she argues that even though consumers generally love Amazon, its low prices, and broad availability of products, Amazon’s “willingness to sustain losses and invest aggressively at the expense of profits and integration across multiple business lines” is problematic as a matter of antitrust.Id.at 746–47. Khan suggests that these features have caused numerous problems for competition, including in the e-book market, the delivery sector, and Amazon’s direct competition with its third-party sellers.Id.at 754–90; Khan,Separation of Platforms and Commerce,supranote 1, at 977;see infraPart III.E.",

Even though there are parallel versions of Amazon’s Brand Registry in other countries,see Brand Registry Eligibility, Amazon, https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility [https://perma.cc/4KPE-QUDJ], the effects of each registry are principally domestic. That is because a third-party seller needs trademark rights in a particular country to take advantage of the Brand Registry’s features to sell to customers in that country.Id.Moreover, trademark systems in other countries are different, such as with regard to the requirement of use in commerce,see, e.g., Barton Beebe & Jeanne C. Fromer,The Future of Trademarks in a Global Multilingual Economy: Evidence and Lessons from the European Union, 112 Trademark Rep. 902, 916–29 (2022), so it makes sense to analyze the effects of the Brand Registry on a country-by-country basis. By comparison, it might be more sensible to evaluate other platforms’ shadow legal systems globally. For example, in reaching its decisions, the Meta Oversight Board has applied more globally relevant human rights frameworks over the U.S.-centered First Amendment.

A related harm is that many of these businesses, particularly the ones registering nonsense marks, are primed to rebrand with a new (nonsense) mark if they get sufficiently negative product reviews on Amazon. Such rebranding would give them an opportunity to resurface on Amazon with the same product but with a clean slate. And it is not as if consumers remembered the mark anyhow. While such rebranding might also see to contravene trademark’s core values, trademark law does not stand in the way of businesses rebranding, as can happen when a business wants to escape scandal, as with ValuJet Airlines becoming AirTran Airways after a plane crash; an association with a negative term, such as ISIS mobile banking app becoming Softcard; or a dated symbol, as with American Telephone & Telegraph becoming primarily known as AT&T.SeeRoy Baharad & Gideon Parchomovsky, Cainmarks (2023) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with authors);Sonia K.
