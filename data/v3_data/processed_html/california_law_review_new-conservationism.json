Such statutes, however, say little about what to do when the two goals conflict. Resolving this tension falls to administrative agencies’ discretion.",

What emerges from this research is a thicket of incoherent agency attempts to incorporate individual animals’ inherent value into removals. Agencies may: (a) express no concern for individual animals; (b) recognize only negative duties toward animals (such as avoiding the infliction of suffering); or (c) observe positive duties toward animals (such as rescuing animals from harsh ecological conditions). Approaches vary across and within agencies, and even within individual agency decisions. Such variation is difficult to defend normatively and exposes agencies to litigation.",

Killing eastern gray squirrels, for example, poses no conservation problem, no matter how inhumane the method, because the supply of gray squirrels runs high. In fact, if eastern gray squirrels posed a threat to an endangered species, then conservationist principles mightrequirekilling them. Traditional conservationism thus entails indifference, if not animosity, toward individual animals in abundant populations.

Sustained attention from agencies could raise congressional awareness of the dilemmas confronting agencies and the options at their disposal. Modest legislative reforms might require that removal methods be humane or that agencies receive more funding to pursue humane removals or removal alternatives. More ambitious reforms could limit or eliminate the circumstances in which mass removals are permitted or require agencies to intervene more frequently to rescue wildlife in distress.[301]With or without congressional changes, however, agencies can and should make progress toward a new conservationism that coherently incorporates animal well-being.",

To determine whether to characterize plaintiffs as animal advocates, I consulted plaintiff organizations’ websites and mission statements. For an organization to qualify as an animal advocate, it had to champion animals’ “welfare,” “well-being,” “dignity,” “rights,” “humane” treatment, or inherent value, or oppose “inhumaneness,” “cruelty,” or animal “suffering.” For plaintiffs lacking informative websites, I turned to the alleged injuries described in judicial opinions or complaints. In addition to the criteria above, I counted descriptions of deep personal connections to removed animals as evidence of valuing individual animals and thus animal advocacy.[305]Curating cases sometimes involved close judgment calls, but most decisions were straightforward. My searches yielded seventy-three cases, sixty-six of which were filed since 2000.",

The purpose statement subsequently references “reduc[ing] undesirable human-deer interactions” and public education about tick-borne diseases.Id.However, the EIS begins its analysis of environmental effects by investigating vegetation impacts, considers effects to public health and safety only toward the end of a long list of consequences, and predicts that these benefits will “not be significant because the Seashore already takes many steps to provide a safe and healthful environment . . . by removing known hazards and applying appropriate measures.”Id.at 190–95 (quoting “Conclusion” sections).

One should not overstate the NPS’s commitment to deer contraception. Because of technological limitations, none of the NPS’s NEPA analyses rely on contraception in the near term. Progress has been slow: As early as 1995, NPS highlighted contraception as a promising means of curbing deer in Gettysburg National Park, yet no analysis in the set identifies a workable contraceptive option. Nat’l Park Serv., White-Tailed Deer Management Plan, Final Environmental Impact Statement 36–38 (1995) [hereinafter 1995 Gettysburg Deer EIS].But see2015 Fire Island Deer EIS at D-1 to D-2 (discussing a research study of reproductive control on Fire Island National Seashore’s deer population from 1993 to 2009). Some argue that agencies are slow-peddling research and acceptance of deer contraceptives for political reasons.SeeAllen T. Rutberg,Managing Wildlife with Contraception: Why Is It Taking So Long?, 44 J. Zoo & Wildlife Med. S38, S40–41 (2013).",
