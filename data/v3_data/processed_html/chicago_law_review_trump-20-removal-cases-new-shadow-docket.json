The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rejected his petition for asylum and deported him back to Guatemala, from which O.C.G. fled to Mexico, where he was raped and held hostage. O.C.G. re-entered the United States; DHS officers issued a reinstatement-of-removal order against him, again designating Guatemala as the country of removal. On February 19, 2025, an Immigration Judge (IJ) granted his application for withholding of removal to Guatemala because his life would be at risk and for similar reasons refused to designate Mexico as a country of removal. Nonetheless, DHS put O.C.G. on a bus to Mexico, whose authorities sent him back to Guatemala .",

On March 28, 2025, District Judge Brian Murphy granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), barring DHS from summary disregard of countries identified in removal orders. The next day, DHS promulgated a new policy : If a country made any “credible” assurance that deported immigrants would not be “persecuted or tortured,” then DHS will remove the immigrant to that country without notice. Without such assurances, the new policy assured immigrants of notice of the new country, but not of their rights to raise reasonable fear of torture or persecution, nor of sufficient time to prepare for a hearing if they asked for one.",

Like the Twilight Zone, the emergency docket is “the middle ground between light and shadow,” and hence is the core of the so-called “ shadow docket .” Commentators have criticized the Court’s shadow-docket interventions : Summary orders shirk the Court’s responsibility to resolve important legal issues in reasoned opinions informed by complete briefing and oral argument, are unwise because they risk premature decisionmaking before issues percolate in the lower courts, provide insufficient or confusing direction for lower courts, and undermine the Court’s legitimacy because of their “shadowy” deliberation. Some critics suggest that the shadow docket is a sneaky way for conservative Justices named by Republican presidents to carry out their regime-change agenda without creating too much publicity. 2 My big problem is that shadow-docket stays deeply (not just technically) undermine the rule of law and violently affect the lives of people like O.C.G. without sufficient legal justification.",

An obvious difference is that the Solicitor General is asking the Court for a lot more emergency stays in order to push pause on an unprecedented number of district court injunctions blocking Trump 2.0 initiatives. Unlike its shadow docket veto of several important Biden Administration measures responding to the genuine COVID emergency, the Court in 2025 entered stays allowing important measures to go forward, notwithstanding legality problems and trumped-up claims of “emergency.” Unprecedented in the history of the Supreme Court, divisions in major emergency stay cases in this decade are usually by strict party lines, with six Republican-appointed Justices in the majority and three Democratic-appointed Justices in dissent.

The Court’s statutory avoidance or shadow revision is inconsistent with Article I’s vesting Congress with primary authority to create statutory law that judges are required to apply under Article VI. Further, this statutory avoidance is at odds with the textualist approach to statutory interpretation that several Justices believe is suggested or required by Article III. Finally, the Court’s acquiescence in Trump 2.0’s cavalier treatment of statutory directives, longstanding rules, and binding treaties is inconsistent with the rule of law that pervades the Constitution.

(US 2025), the Court granted an emergency stay of a preliminary injunction requiring the DHS to provide due process to immigrants before sending them to possibly dangerous countries. Another immigration issue created more problems for Trump 2.0. The President invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to summarily remove dozens of Venezuelans (almost all in the United States legally) to third countries on the ground that they were allegedly members of a criminal gang invading the United States. By an administrative mistake, DHS deported Kilmer Abrego Garcia (not a gang member) to El Salvador, where he was held in the notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison. In Noem v. Garcia , the Court substantially rejected the Government’s application for an emergency stay and confirmed the district court’s order for DHS to “facilitate” Garcia’s release from hell-prison and return to the United States, where Trump 2.0 sought to deport him to Uganda, then Eswatini , an effort unresolved as we go to press on September 23, 2025. The next month, in A.A.R.P. v. Donald Trump , a 7–2 Court granted an emergency stay to Venezuelans scheduled to be removed to third countries; the per curiam opinion barred DHS from detaining or removing these persons without notice and a meaningful hearing on the issue of their gang membership. In National TPS Alliance v. Noem , an 8–1 Court stayed a district court injunction invalidating Trump 2.0’s revocation of protected status for thousands of other Venezuelans under the 1990 immigration statute.",

In Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) , an 8–1 Court granted an emergency stay to allow Trump 2.0 agencies to formulate final RIF plans that could then be reviewed. Previous emergency stays had protected DOGE and specific agencies from preliminary injunctions, and less than a week after the AFGE stay, the 6–3 Court granted the Secretary of Education her own emergency stay, notwithstanding strong evidence that she was charged and proceeding with a dismantling of her agency. In Department of Education v. California (2025), the Court held that school districts seeking statutorily required payments had to proceed in Tucker Act lawsuits in the Court of Claims.

In the new shadow docket, the first factor (previously considered the most important) has faded or sometimes disappeared, and the last three have been revised to reflect massive deference to presidential preferences.

Every premise of the conclusion was questionable and required further analysis: Ludecke held that courts must be available to evaluate claims about the AEA’s interpretation, the AEA explicitly vests American courts with jurisdiction to order removal but only with “ sufficient cause ,” and the AEA is a different statutory scheme than the Immigration Act of 1917, which had been enacted against a background of executive discretion in immigration-admission decisions .

With Trump 2.0 loyalists running the White House, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and most departments and agencies, Trump’s top-down approach to governance is inspiring or rewarding officials who twist or ignore statutes and treaties that would slow down the headline-grabbing policy agenda and who are willing to follow a sanitized version of the Roy Cohn playbook.

In this Comment, Coby Goldberg provides the only comprehensive analysis of the judicial takings caselaw since Stop the Beach , in order to determine why no court has found a judicial taking. Based on this analysis of the caselaw, this Comment suggests that finding a judicial taking is all but impossible. That conclusion does not mean that judicial takings doctrine has had no influence on property jurisprudence in the years since Stop the Beach , however. This Comment identifies three cases in which state courts have used the possibility of judicial takings as reasons not to make decisions that undercut property rights. In those cases, judicial takings doctrine is functioning as something akin to a canon of constitutional avoidance. If decided the other way, none of those three decisions would have avoided actions that would have amounted to judicial takings. This Comment thus concludes that judicial takings doctrine leads to worse outcomes in property law, and so, out of a concern for constitutional problems that never arise, courts reject decisions they would otherwise adopt.",
