      "text": "This brief and basically unannotated essay lays out some constitutional considerations associated with prominent (and some not so prominent) proposals for Supreme Court reform circulating among progressives. 1 I confess to the feeling that writing this in the summer of 2024 resembles analysis of policy proposals for the German Social Democratic Party in January 1933. Here are two “defenses.” Saying something useful about the obviously more important questions on the table is outside my area of expertise. Legal progressives have typically, though not universally, focused on policy proposals for adoption in the short term; legal conservatives successfully played the long game. Legal progressives might learn something from that.",

      "text": "Two preliminary points: first, actually accomplishing Court reform by statute, one might think, requires (at least) what’s come to be called the “trifecta:” control of the House, Senate, and the Presidency by a single party whose members are generally committed to the idea of Court reform. The idea of “control” is a bit complicated. Court reform can be accomplished by constitutional amendment, of course, which requires supermajorities in the House, the Senate, and the states—but not the presidency. I generally put Court reform via constitutional amendment to one side in this essay, though the existence of the amendment process comes up in connection with some proposals for statutory reform. “Control” of the House and the Presidency is straight-forward, that of the Senate less so. There it might be a majority large enough to overcome a filibuster, or it might be a majority willing to enact legislation by simple majority, ignoring the filibuster on this issue or in general.",

      "text": "Second, I focus on proposals that would affect the Court immediately upon adoption. Ordinarily politicians have incentives to use their political capital to work for adoption of legislation that will give them immediate political benefit. Members of Congress typically don’t spend their capital on projects that will pay off fifteen years down the road. So, for example, a proposal to limit the terms of those Supreme Court justices appointed hereafter has little in it to recommend to a politician who believes that voters want change in the Supreme Court now. 2 There’s one qualification: proposals with long-term payoffs might be part of a comprehensive institutional reform package—call it a “good government” program—with some immediate payoffs and some deferred payoffs. At the moment, though, Supreme Court reform doesn’t seem to be part of such a broader reform movement.",

There’s some evidence from political scientists that the introduction of court-curbing proposals—not their enactment—affects the Court’s overall behavior. 3 The introduction of such proposals in sufficient volume signals to the Court that a non-trivial number of legislators think the Court has overreached, and the Court appears to react by pulling back from its more advanced positions. The mechanism by which this effect occurs is quite obscure and not, I think, well described in the political science literature. It might have to do with individual justices’ desires to get approval from “attentive” audiences—and if so the effect might be muted in today’s political world where conservative and liberal justices have separate circles of social approval. 4",

Impeachment is another constitutionally authorized method for affecting the Court’s composition. 6 It requires a majority in the House and a supermajority in the Senate (and no participation by the president). The failed impeachment of Samuel Chase is conventionally taken to stand for the proposition that judges cannot be impeached merely for disagreement with their rulings. More formally, I suppose, the Chase impeachment (and the fact that no federal judges, including Justices, have been impeached for anything other than ethical lapses) is taken to be a congressional interpretation of the term “good behavior.” “Good behavior” means, roughly, “ethical behavior” rather than “behavior that advances a good vision of the law.” 7",

The rationale is that the Court has substantially reduced the number of cases it decides on the merits while retaining and even expanding the number of law clerks each justice has—and that it is good public policy for justices to write more of “their” opinions (“more of” meaning both a larger number written personally by each justice and a greater portion of each opinion issued under the justice’s name). We know enough about the way justices employ law clerks to believe that reducing the number of law clerks will give incentives to older justices to retire (that is, we know that as justices serve more years on the Court they delegate more opinion-drafting responsibility to their law clerks—in my view, I should add, an entirely sensible course of action). They might respond to the reduction in the number of law clerks by reorganizing their offices, which is to say that the incentive effects of this proposal are only incentive effects, not mandates.",

It is framed as a “good government” measure—people who do less work than they used to should get fewer resources than they used to. It might have an effect similar to term limits, though the choice to retire is left to each justice. And the increased incentive to retire might be an intended effect. This third feature raises a question I address in more detail in connection with Court expansion. Suppose a proposal would have the effect of changing the Court’s composition in a setting where it’s reasonable to believe that Congress disagrees with the substantive decisions the justices—and in particular disproportionately the older justices who will feel the incentives most strongly—have rendered. Is it sufficient that there be a “good government” rationale for the proposal (that is, is the proposal insulated from constitutional invalidation by the existence of such a rationale)? Or must the “good government” rationale actually motivate the proposal’s adoption (is that rationale a mere fig-leaf badly concealing an intention to alter outcomes)? Perhaps there’s a convention, similar to that associated with impeachment, that mere “fig leaf” rationales are inadequate.",

Alternatively, the only court specifically identified in the Constitution is the Supreme Court. 9 That might be taken to imply that a person’s commission must refer only to that Court. Or, the Constitution refers to “one Supreme Court,” 10 implying that a person can be appointed to only that Court (otherwise the person would serve on “one Supreme Court” and a court of appeals).

One paper models the “trifecta” scenario and concludes that sixty years from now the Court might have 27 members 31 —in my view not unwieldy. The Court would be so large that it wouldn’t be able to develop a consistent constitutional jurisprudence.
