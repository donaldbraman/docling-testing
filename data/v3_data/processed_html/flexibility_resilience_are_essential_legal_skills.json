So when law students come to administrators with inevitable complaints about new teaching ways, law schools will need to resist the temptation to offer false reassurances. Instead law school communities can embrace the opportunity to practice what they preach and remind students they are preparing them for the volatility of the future by teaching them to approach inevitable challenges with adaptability and resilience.",
