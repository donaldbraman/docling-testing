      "text": "The Supreme Court has long emphasized state and local supremacy over public schooling. This theory of education federalism has been at the heart of the Court’s decisions pulling back on school desegregation and refusing to find a federal fundamental right to education. Today, America’s schools are as segregated as they were in the 1970s and often fail to prepare Americans for democratic participation. Despite the national impact of school failures, the federal government is seen to have only a minimal role in public education.",

      "text": "This Note argues that the Constitution’s guarantee of a republican form of government creates a federal duty to provide for public education. From the Founding through Reconstruction, America’s education system has expanded to account for its broadening electorate, and education has been understood as a core foundation of republican government. Moreover, Congress has historically taken an active role in shaping state education systems. Recognizing this relationship suggests broader powers for both courts and Congress to intervene in public education to ensure an educated electorate.",

Close this Note makes several novel contributions. It articulates the educated-electorate principle, relying on the close rela­tionship between enfranchisement and education to argue that education inheres in the republican form of government. This principle provides a conceptual framework for linking education to the American tradition of republicanism as preserved by the Guarantee Clause. Relying on the prin­ciple, this Note provides the first comprehensive argument that the Guarantee Clause creates a federal duty to ensure that state electorates receive a sufficient education to participate in republican government.",

Part I examines the legal regime that has inhibited the creation of robust and equitable public school sys­tems capable of preparing students to participate in a republican form of government. Part II relies on text and history to argue that the educated-electorate principle inheres in the republican form of government, mak­ing the Guarantee Clause a hook for federal intervention. Finally, Part III describes the Guarantee Clause power and articulates how the courts and Congress could meet their constitutional obligation to provide for an educated electorate.",
