      "text": "Police use of force continues to be a significant problem in American law and society. Recent discussions have focused on doctrinal issues such as what type of force is considered “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment and the propriety of qualified immunity as a defense that can shield law enforcement from civil litigation. However, there has been little commentary on how these and other legal questions might be informed by medicine — specifically, victim diagnoses that might effectively absolve officers from criminal prosecution or civil liability. One prominent example concerns excited delirium, which is thought to be a psychiatric issue characterized by the acute onset of extreme agitation that can become so severe that someone might die spontaneously, on their own, without anyone to blame except the person’s own mental condition. This diagnosis has been used by coroners, medical examiners, forensic pathologists, and law enforcement to suggest that some deaths in police custody occur not because the decedent was subject to unlawful force, but because the mysterious onset of a psychiatric illness led them to die suddenly. But there are significant problems with this claim. Notably, since its inception in the 1980s, researchers have found little evidence that this medical condition exists. This lack of proof leads to a critical question: How did law become so welcoming to excited delirium when medical and scientific communities continue to have serious reservations? This Article provides the first empirical assessment of how excited delirium has been treated as an evidentiary matter within federal courts. In doing so, it explores how federal courts deploy Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to understand the claims made by expert witnesses in cases regarding the admissibility of excited delirium as a medical diagnosis that might explain deaths in police custody. The findings show that excited delirium often enters evidentiary proceedings as a contested medical concept. Yet, through the machinations of the law of evidence, these claims exit courtroom proceedings as legally relevant facts. How this transmutation happens, and the evidentiary moves that make it possible, highlight the extent to which legal doctrine can settle an otherwise unsettled — if not wholly discredited — area of medicine to make deaths in police custody seem natural, blameless, and unproblematic. Understanding how the law of evidence contributes to concealing what might otherwise be seen as unreasonable uses of force is critical for ongoing discussions concerning police reform.",

      "text": "Two days before Christmas in 2020, the Quinto family of Antioch, California, was in a desperate situation. Angelo Quinto, a thirty-year-old Navy veteran, was suffering from a mental health crisis. 1 Earlier that year, Quinto had been assaulted and experienced a traumatic brain injury, which led him to have episodes of paranoia — one of which seemed to be occurring that December evening. 2 Quinto began acting aggressively, and the family called 911 for help. 3 When police arrived, Quinto’s family said that his mother was holding him in her arms and that he was calm. 4 Officers Perkinson and Becerra grabbed Quinto from his mother and pinned him face down on the ground. 5 While Quinto “pleaded ‘please, don’t kill me,’” the officers put Quinto in a prone restraint. 6 His hands were handcuffed behind his back and his legs were crossed and bent backward. 7 According to the Quintos, officers then held Quinto down by keeping a knee pressed behind his neck over a period of five minutes 8 — a situation not unlike what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, earlier that year. 9 Quinto became unresponsive. 10 When the officers “flipped [him] over, . . . blood [had] pooled [under]neath his face.” 11 Quinto was taken by ambulance to Sutter Delta Medical Center, where he later died. 12",

Confused by the idea that only Quinto was responsible for his death, the family had a second autopsy performed by Dr. Bennet Omalu. 14 Omalu found that Quinto’s eyes showed evidence of petechial hemorrhages 15 — signs of asphyxiation where strangulation leads blood capillaries in the eyes to burst. 16 While being deposed, Dr. Ikechi Ogan, the first pathologist who made the excited delirium diagnosis, “was shown a photo of Quinto’s eyes.” 17 Ogan agreed, on the record, that the unusual hemorrhages in Quinto’s eyes were clearly visible. 18 Yet the autopsy report failed to mention “key signs” of Quinto’s asphyxiation. 19",

Please respect my boundaries,” “I’m just different,” and “I don’t even kill flies” to prove that he was not dangerous. 23 Nevertheless, the officers proceeded to restrain McClain, placing him in a chokehold and putting him in handcuffs. 24 During this struggle, McClain told the officers he was having difficulty breathing and then vomited and apologized to the officers. 25",

      "text": "Police use of force and accountability have been important topics over the past few years as the public grapples with what many have described as a “racial reckoning” 43 following several deaths of unarmed Black people in police custody that were filmed by bystanders and distributed on social and legacy media. 44 Much of the conversation in the law literature has focused on exploring doctrinal questions such as how the Fourth Amendment structures conversations about the reasonableness of police force, which can inform whether an officer might be held civilly or criminally responsible. 45 Yet, there has been little discussion about how doctrinal assessments regarding reasonableness can be complicated by medical diagnoses that are used to suggest that decedents died from preexisting conditions rather than the use of force. One such diagnosis is excited delirium , which is often used to suggest that some deaths in police custody result not from the force that was used , but from self-induced agitation and physical stress stemming from a psychiatric condition that can lead some people to die spontaneously, through no one’s fault but their own. The vignettes at the outset of this Article highlight several instances where excited delirium has been invoked to explain the deaths of people in police custody, and how this “disease” has been positioned to deflect attention away from questions about the reasonableness of the force used and toward evaluating the decedents’ mental health. For example, as described above with respect to the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Waters v. Coleman , federal courts have used excited delirium diagnoses to shape their determinations of whether police officers can face civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. 46",

      "text": "Law’s deference to this medical diagnosis is curious, particularly since excited delirium does not seem to be a real health condition. In fact, excited delirium is a deeply contested concept among researchers and clinicians. Professional bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association 47 and the American Medical Association 48 have made public statements on how excited delirium is not an appropriate term or diagnosis. Similarly, two of the main medical guidebooks on identifying and diagnosing psychiatric disorders — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM-5”) and the International Classification of Diseases (“ICD-11”) — do not recognize the term as a legitimate disorder or medical condition. 49 This professional distancing from the concept reflects a finding easily observable in peer-reviewed scientific and clinical literature: There is little scientific evidence to support excited delirium as a legitimate medical claim and virtually no research that identifies a clear pathology on how this psychiatric condition, even if real, could cause death. 50",

      "text": "This tension between law’s regular acceptance of excited delirium and medicine’s deep skepticism gives rise to a question explored in this Article: How has law come to a seemingly settled understanding of a disease that science and medicine largely view as demonstrably unsettled, if not wholly unsupported? To be sure, there are many instances where medical or scientific evidence becomes part of legal disputes in which judges and juries assess the weight and importance of the evidence in relation to the facts of the case. 51 But the issue of excited delirium stands apart from other discussions concerning the role of science in legal decisionmaking. Questions regarding excited delirium are distinct from those pertaining to the admissibility of other types of scientific or medical testimony such as DNA evidence. This distinction exists because there are no established standards for determining excited delirium, nor are there any minimal agreed-upon principles shared among professionals. From the perspective of the long history of forensic sciences and expert witness testimony, 52 the evidentiary support for excited delirium is much closer to that of the highly questioned (and often discredited) “first generation” 53 of forensics (such as bite mark analysis and fingerprinting 54 ) than the more “robust . . . second generation,” 55 such as DNA typing. 56 Given excited delirium’s methodological and evidentiary proximity to a collection of first-generation forensic practices that many frown upon, how is it that federal courts continue to allow — if not fully support — the use of excited delirium in cases concerning police use of force?",

      "text": "This Article explores these critical questions at the intersection of law and medicine. Part I provides a brief primer on excited delirium, its history and usage in police use of force cases, and arguments that law enforcement and some researchers have made for it as a valid explanation for some deaths in police custody. Part II then takes a closer look at the rules and doctrines concerning expert witness testimony and the admission of scientific evidence into federal courts as a way to situate the broader question that is taken up in Part III: How does excited delirium, a fringe idea within medicine with a deeply questionable origin story, enter legal discussions on police use of force and become a seemingly legitimate medical diagnosis to explain deaths in police custody? To do this, Part III looks at how expert witnesses use excited delirium in federal courts by engaging in an empirical examination that evaluates legal shifts in how this purported medical condition is discussed in the context of claims concerning police use of force, from its first articulation in federal case law in 1998 until 2023. This qualitative assessment unearths early conversations concerning excited delirium in evidentiary proceedings to show how, over time, the rules of evidence came to allow testimony not generally accepted within medicine to morph into legal claims that shape federal courts’ evaluations of use of force cases. By treating its gatekeeping function in relation to expert witness testimony as a procedural inquiry — that is, as a process or series of boxes to check — instead of embarking on a deep assessment of the evidence and its broader implications, law has come to give excited delirium much more credibility than science or medicine ever has.",

      "text": "Through a detailed case-by-case examination of early disputes where excited delirium was first brought in front of federal courts, this Article shows how we have landed at a rather awkward moment when legal decisions and subsequent reliance on them as precedent are seen as more relevant to questions about the legitimacy of this medical diagnosis than the scientific research itself — at least in courtrooms where police have been accused of using excessive force. This phenomenon has tremendous implications for how we think about doctrinal rules surrounding expert witnesses, as well as basic notions of justice and accountability, in relation to both civil and criminal adjudications concerning police use of force. Part IV proposes three policy recommendations for how, considering the discussion in Part III, law should respond to both the particular issue of excited delirium in the courtroom and expert witness testimony more broadly — especially as scientific and medical evidence continue to shape legal debates and outcomes regarding police use of force.",

See Erin Murphy, The New Forensics: Criminal Justice, False Certainty, and the Second Generation of Scientific Evidence , 95 Calif. L. Rev. 721, 726–30 (2007). Professor Murphy argues that the first generation of forensic techniques — traditional “analysis of bite and tool marks, hair and fiber, ballistics, handwriting, voice exemplars, and fingerprints” — had minimal utility and were “usually [used] in a supporting role to other forms of evidence like eyewitness testimony or the defendant’s own confession.” Id. at 726. The lacking scientific basis of these approaches has led them to be thought of with great skepticism due to what Murphy describes as their being (1) of “limited application”; (2) “observational, rather than technical or experimental” and “neither conceptually complicated nor scientifically rigorous,” id. ; (3) “mechanically unsophisticated” in “not employ[ing] complex interpretive machinery or instrumentation”; (4) “reactive and self-contained in their investigative scope,” id. at 727; and (5) often too narrow to “implicate greater questions of personal privacy,” id. at 728. On the other hand, Murphy says that “second-generation techniques” — typified by DNA typing but also including “data mining, location tracking . . . , and biometric scanning,” id. — share different traits: They (1) have wide applicability to a range of cases, see id. ; (2) are based on robust scientific principles, see id. at 729; (3) have both “methodological” and “mechanical sophistication,” id. ; and (4) “rely upon computerized databases to store large quantities of information,” id. at 730.",
