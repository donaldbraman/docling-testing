The CSLFRF empowered states and local governments to spend on programs of their own choosing 4 42 U.S.C. §§ 802–806. —granting recipients wide discretion, but not a blank check. Indeed, the program contained one key limitation: the tax “Offset Provision.” Recipients could spend the new money on nearly anything, but they could not use it to “directly or indirectly offset” their taxes. 5 42 U.S.C. § 802(c)(2)(A).

An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something—anything—“sovereign” enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence.

That is, until now, the Supreme Court has never had an opportunity to consider Spending Clause and state standing jurisprudence together. And for good reason: In cases applying Pennhurst ’s clear-notice requirement, nongovernmental plaintiffs (who were not involved in the grant of federal funds) were actively bringing suit and the defendants (recipients of federal funds) used the clear-notice rule as a defense to their liability. 158 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.

Furthermore, in Dole and Sebelius , there was no question that the relevant legislation’s spending conditions directly affected and injured the state plaintiffs. 159 See Vladeck, supra note 25, at 862–63.

Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes—in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a “sovereign” policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",

See Ohio v. Sec’y, Dep’t of Treasury, No. 1:21-cv-181, 2021 WL 1931522 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 30, 2021). The Fifth Circuit issued its opinion in Texas v. Yellen in June 2024. 105 F.4th 755 (5th Cir. 2024). Across six cases, five circuits have decided whether the state plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Offset Provision. 164 Missouri v. Yellen, 39 F.4th 1063 (8th Cir. 2022); Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841 (9th Cir. 2022); Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325 (6th Cir. 2022); Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th 983 (6th Cir. 2022); West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124 (11th Cir. 2023); Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755. By the numbers, four circuits found standing for at least some of the state plaintiffs; 165 Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 845 (the Ninth Circuit); Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 329 (the Sixth Circuit); Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1132 (the Eleventh Circuit); Texas v.

Yellen, 105 F.4th 763–67. The Sixth Circuit in Kentucky v. Yellen held that Tennessee had standing but for a proprietary, “compliance cost” injury.

Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 347 (clarifying that the Offset Provision “is not ‘unconstitutional’ under the Spending Clause” but that Tennessee may discontinue compliance with it because it is unclear); Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1141–43 (relying on Eleventh Circuit precedent to conclude that the ambiguity of the Offset Provision renders it facially unconstitutional); Texas v.

      "text": "This Note catalogs the data of this unique legal experiment. Generally, the state plaintiffs pleaded multiple theories of injury, several of which are well-established bases for standing in federal court. 172 Broadly summarized, there were four theories of injury. The states alleged the “Spending Contract” and “Tax Power” sovereign injuries. See infra Section I.A–I.B. The states also alleged a Driehaus injury asserting pre-enforcement standing given the risk of Treasury recoupment. See, e.g. , Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 848–51 (9th Cir. 2022) (citing Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014)). Finally, the states alleged a compliance cost injury given the need to “track[]” if state expenditures violated the Offset Provision. See, e.g. , Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 342–44. Most relevant to this Note are the entirely new asserted sovereign injuries that only a sovereign entity like a state can suffer. 173 See Fallon, supra note 108, at 1105 (arguing that only sovereign injuries are not “transsubstantive,” or unique to only one type of plaintiff). Although the cases describe the states’ sovereign injuries in slightly different ways, the descriptions gravitate toward two poles: a “Spending Contract” injury and a “Tax Power” injury. The opinions do not always distinguish between these sovereign injuries, but, at least as used in this Note, Spending Contract injuries are those created by unconstitutional offers , and Tax Power injuries are those created by unconstitutional subject matter . The courts’ attempts to articulate these novel sovereign injuries reveal varying perspectives on how state plaintiffs “suffered” these injuries.

Under the broad Spending Contract rule, ambiguity in the word “reasonable” would immediately invalidate the spending condition, even if the overseeing agency had no plans to enforce the requirement. Environmental bills, perpetually under scrutiny for their ambiguity, 204 See, e.g. , West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S.

As federal legislation continues to operate through the spending power, 205 See Gould, supra note 24, at 212.

Judge Nalbandian argued that special solicitude granted liberal injury and standing requirements for state plaintiffs. 229 Id. at 359. And he suggested that, per Massachusetts v. EPA , states are subject to a reduced imminence standard for standing and that “as federal regulation has increased over the states, the list of sovereign injuries has grown.” 230 Id. at 359; see id.

Applying this elastic injury and imminence standard to the present case, Judge Nalbandian insisted that the Offset Provision created ongoing Tax Power standing. 231 Id. at 360–62. Because the law “intruded” into a traditional state function and “chill[ed] the States from enacting” tax cuts, states risked damaging their economies—arguably a core sovereign concern. 232 Id. at 359–61 (quoting Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 599 (6th Cir. 2022)). As in Massachusetts v. EPA , this injury could also be framed as a quasi-sovereign (state on behalf of its citizens) or a proprietary (state’s bottom line) injury. 549 U.S. 497, 518–20 (2007). Even if the final rule did moot the risk of recoupment, 233 Judge Nalbandian did not think that the final rule credibly disavowed recoupment. Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 362–63 (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Judge Nalbandian argued that the Rule “narrow[s]” state regulatory flexibility, “which in turn takes a toll on the States’ citizens and economies.” 234 Id. at 363–64 (“[I]f the States wish to comply with the Rules, they must do something —either raise other taxes or lower expenditures elsewhere in the budget to offset a revenue reduction.

Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985) (overruling Nat’l League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976)). Judge Nalbandian’s approach separates from more ancillary, nonsovereign regulation certain policies based on some set of core sovereign subject matters and quarantines them from the federal government—a completely unworkable standard that would be based entirely on a judge’s own understanding of sovereign interests. The quarantined policy space is also underinclusive. It is hard to imagine that, in a world where states have standing to challenge federal regulation that touched on tax, they would lack standing for regulations that pertained to a national healthcare program. Further, given the Fifth Circuit’s categorical prohibition on using the Spending Clause to prohibit tax cuts, it is possible that legislative subject matter could be decisive on the merits as well. 236 Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755 (5th Cir. 2024). Returning to the environmental bill hypothetical discussed above: Even with precise, unambiguous language, a bill that regulates a state’s environment or land could also intrude on some sovereign prerogative (as it seemed to in Massachusetts v.

States could rattle off any number of sacred sovereign subject matters (taxes, the environment, education, abortion—the sky is really the limit) to essentially reverse-preempt federal legislation on those questions. 237 Cf. Metzger, supra note 143, at 2038–39 (arguing that standing for these issues is desirable).

The haphazard piling of Judge Nalbandian’s inferences aside, a state’s economic health would likely fall under this public interest umbrella.

Following the “search and destroy” theme, the Fifth Circuit further argued that the Constitution imposes an affirmative “bar on ambiguous spending conditions and provid[es] grounds for an injunction against the enforcement of such conditions.” 267 Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 771 (5th Cir. 2024). Ignoring the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education , which provides that Congress is not required to “prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular applications” of its spending conditions, 268 Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985). the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits effectively eliminated any interpretive wiggle room.

Each of the courts that “applied” special solicitude did so differently, often giving lip service to the doctrine or Massachusetts v. EPA without actually explaining how it factored into their analysis. The Eighth Circuit appeared to shrug off Missouri’s special solicitude, holding that it had not otherwise met “the basic requirements for standing.” 281 See Missouri v. Yellen, 39 F.4th 1063, 1070 n.7 (8th Cir. 2022). By contrast, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, similar to their analysis of the Tax Power injury, 282 See supra Sections I.B.2 and I.B. referenced Massachusetts v. EPA without outlining the substantive “work” special solicitude did in their analyses. 283 See Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 851 (9th Cir. 2022) (“This special standing has relevance here, where Arizona alleges that ARPA infringes upon its sovereign rights.”); West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1136 (11th Cir. 2023). Based on the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits’ temporally unrestricted description of the Spending Contract injury, special solicitude may be helping to eliminate standing’s imminence requirement. 284 See supra Section I.B.1; Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 852; Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1136. But it is hard to say for sure: Special solicitude seems to act as a vague, pro-state-standing background principle for these two courts in the same way as did the Tax Power injury. Judge Nalbandian also argued separately in Kentucky v. Yellen that special solicitude changed the test of imminence for state pre-enforcement standing from a “credible threat” of enforcement to the lower “risk of harm” for both sovereign and quasi-sovereign injuries. 285 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 359–60, 359 n.2, 363 (6th Cir. 2022) (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 521 (2007)) (citing Susan B.

Here, there are no major question doctrine hurdles to satisfy for victory: Any state attorney general can enjoin any federal spending condition.
