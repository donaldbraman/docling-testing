As part of the New Left’s vision for a different society, students, sometimes joined by faculty, demanded an end to the Vietnam War and war industry research, fought for Black and ethnic studies departments, and protested urban renewal plans that displaced Black working-class communities.",

Police repression follows, escalating into violence. Universities create or enlarge their own police or security forces in response, while also expanding codes of conduct to quash disruptive protest activity.

First, campus police and administrators engage in political surveillance, monitoring the political activity of the campus community, which enables universities to sanction students and faculty through campus codes of conduct and refer them for criminal prosecution. Second, police and administrators network with local and federal law enforcement agencies to share information. Third, police act formally and informally as part of the disciplinary process within universities to sanction and control protests. This Piece ends with contemporary and historic examples of university leaders who have avoided police repression as a response to student dissent and instead chosen negotiation.",

Times (Dec. 24, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/gaza-vietnam-student-protest.html (on file with the Columbia Law Review ) (describing parallels between anti-Vietnam war protests and student organizing against the genocide in Palestine, observed by people who lived through the Vietnam era). Several experts on protest movements have noted the unusual use of suspensions and expulsions in the pro-Palestine context when compared to other contemporary student protests, such as those against schools’ investments in the fossil fuel or private prison industries. See Laura Meckler & Hannah Natanson, Massive Pro-Palestinian College Protests Bring Rare Surge in Discipline , Wash.

Close While some seek to distinguish the past from pre­sent—claiming the past eras were less repressive and the causes more just, or more sympathetic to university officials 16 16 See, e.g., Wines, supra note 15 (interviewing a former elected official who had protested the Vietnam War in the 1960s, who said that the current war in Gaza “has a lot more moral and philosophical nuance” than the United States’ involvement in Vietnam, which was a “show of superpower hubris” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Miles Rapoport, former Conn. Sec’y of State)). For a broader discussion on how activist movements recover and use forgotten or marginalized histories to inform contemporary struggles, see generally Aziz Choudry & Salim Vally, History’s Schools: Past Struggles and Present Realities, in Reflections on Knowledge, Learning and Social Movements: History’s Schools 1 (Aziz Choudry & Salim Valley eds., 2017). ... Close —this Piece instead aims to excavate the connections between past and present responses to stu­dent protests. It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre­vent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis­placed Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now, 17 17 Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan­tytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

Close and campus police agencies as they exist today formed in response to the widespread activ­ism in that period. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities across the United States tasked local and state police officers with controlling college campuses and disrupting public dissent, sometimes unnecessarily and violently. 18 18 See Jerome H. Skolnick, Task Force on Demonstrations, Protests, & Grp. Violence, The Politics of Protest: Violent Aspects of Protest & Confrontation 185–86 (1969) (referencing the Kerner Commission’s finding that, during the 1967 riots, “police violence was out of control” and the Cox and Sparling Commissions’ findings that police used unnecessary force, often vindictively, against both peaceful and “provocative” pro­testers (internal quotation marks omitted)). ...

With a focus on a past era spanning years and multiple universi­ties, fully recounting the negotiations and protests is beyond the scope of this Piece.

Close But deciding when and how to utilize police and whether to call on local police instead of or alongside campus police involves a mix of politics, capacity, and stakeholder influence. For example, university presidents faced considerable pressure from, among other sources, federal lawmakers and state legislatures to eliminate the spring 2024 encampments and quash protected pro-Palestine speech. 44 44 Other sources of pressure not addressed in this Piece but worth acknowledging are major donors and private influence. See Alan Blinder, For Columbia and a Powerful Donor, Months of Talks and Millions at Risk, N.Y.

Close A better understanding of the coercive influence of political and economic con­cerns is critical for balancing interests and determining what role police should play on campuses, and whether they belong there at all. 45 45 See Suriel et al., supra note 4, at xvi–xviii (surveying interdisciplinary scholarship on campus policing and claiming campus police departments are under-studied, “especially in light of their significant impact not only in shaping university life for stu­dents, faculty, and staff but also in gentrifying surrounding neighborhoods”). More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race–class sub­jugated communities.

      "text": "This Piece proceeds in four parts. Part I is a reminder that the con­flicts and struggles faced by today’s administrators echo those of their pre­decessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ­ism—the mid-1960s to early 1970s—this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity. 46 46 Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty­towns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat & Anushka Shorewala, From ‘Shantytown’ to the ‘Liberated Zone’: Cornell’s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https://cornellsun.com/2024/‌05/07/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments/ [https:// per​ma.cc/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024); Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation’s complicity with South Africa’s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ. (Nov. 16, 2011), https:// ​www.‌chron​icle.com/article/public-colleges-struggle-to-respond-to-occupy-protests/ (on file with the Columbia Law Review ); see also, e.g., Christopher F.

It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro­testers, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on. See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760–61 (2023) (out­lining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress “not only expressions of dis­sent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression”); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum.

Rev. 1197, 1199–204 (2025) (clarifying the limits of criminalizing protest by analyzing overbreadth doctrine through Supreme Court case law, evaluating current protest-related statutes, and offering guidelines to reform or eliminate laws that are overly broad). For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt­ing a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel’s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine.

This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro­test movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike. 48 48 See, e.g., Sarah Michelson, Student Workers on Strike at UCLA, Knock LA (Dec. 1, 2022), https://knock-la.com/ucla-student-workers-strike/ [https://perma.cc/FT9C-72​T8]. ... Close Race and educa­tion scholars have long criticized campus police departments’ actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ­ees. 49 49 See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 854 (“Studies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.” (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func­tions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race–class subju­gated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811–12, 864–65. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id. at 862–65. ... Close Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for­mal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga­tions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out. 50 50 See id. at 837 (noting that campus police are integrated into “threat assessment teams as part of the university administration’s efforts to uphold its legal obligations to secure and maintain campus safety”); infra note 79 and accompanying text (describing how universities expanded into surrounding communities as part of urban renewal efforts). ...

Although worthy of its own study, the Right seems to use different tactics than traditional protest and demonstration, such as inviting controversial speakers to college campuses.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race–class sub­jugated communities.

      "text": "Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty­towns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat & Anushka Shorewala, From ‘Shantytown’ to the ‘Liberated Zone’: Cornell’s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https://cornellsun.com/2024/‌05/07/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments/ [https:// per​ma.cc/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024); Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation’s complicity with South Africa’s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ. (Nov. 16, 2011), https:// ​www.‌chron​icle.com/article/public-colleges-struggle-to-respond-to-occupy-protests/ (on file with the Columbia Law Review ); see also, e.g., Christopher F.

It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro­testers, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on. See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760–61 (2023) (out­lining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress “not only expressions of dis­sent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression”); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum. L. Rev. 1197, 1199–204 (2025) (clarifying the limits of criminalizing protest by analyzing overbreadth doctrine through Supreme Court case law, evaluating current protest-related statutes, and offering guidelines to reform or eliminate laws that are overly broad). For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt­ing a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel’s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine.

Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations.
