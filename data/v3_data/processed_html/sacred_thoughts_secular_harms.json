Two recent Supreme Court decisions —National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (NIFLA) and 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis— suggest a nascent but expansive free thought jurisprudence, one that increasingly shields religious actors not just from government interference in belief but also compliance with generally applicable laws.",

      "text": "For decades, the Supreme Court had maintained several guardrails to cabin religious practice without unduly infringing on religious thought. These guardrails—evaluating the government’s purpose behind a law, considering whether a religious exemption would cause third-party harm, and questioning the sincerity of a religious plaintiff—have ensured that religiously motivated conduct does not override neutral laws. NIFLA and 303 Creative , though, weaken these constraints and offer plaintiffs a roadmap to use free thought to challenge a wide range of laws, including antidiscrimination protections, workplace regulations, and public health measures.",

Though long venerated by scholars and judges, 1 1 See, e.g., Marc Jonathan Blitz, Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution, 2010 Wis. L. Rev. 1049, 1051 (describing how the Supreme Court and scholars view freedom of thought as broader than freedom of speech); Matthew B. Lawrence, Addiction and Liberty, 108 Cornell L. Rev. 259, 261 (2023) (“The Supreme Court has repeatedly described ‘freedom of thought’ as a key aspect of the liberty that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to protect.”); see also Jerome A. Barron, Access to the Press–A New First Amendment Right, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1641, 1649 (1967) (“Justice Cardozo clearly indicated that while many rights could be eliminated and yet ‘justice’ not undone, ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist . . .

Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325–27 (1937))); Rafael Domingo, Restoring Freedom of Conscience, 30 J.L. & Religion 176, 176 (2015) (“Freedom of thought is required for the human person as a rational being . . . .”); Charles Fried, Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice, 78 B.U. L. Rev. 717, 723–24 (1998) (“By speaking of freedom of thought I wish to push to the fore exactly that which developed First Amendment doctrine . . . seeks to establish: that the state has no business seeking to control—that is, to prohibit or command—the minds of its citizens.”); Jed Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 Harv.

Close to substance abuse. 7 7 See Lawrence, supra note 1, at 263 (identifying a freedom from addiction as a fundamental liberty interest and explaining that “the right to freedom from addiction manifests as a legal tool to protect Americans’ freedom of thought”). ...

In 2006, Winkler published a study examining every federal district and circuit court decision raising a religious liberty claim in the fifteen years after Smith. Adam Winkler, Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time—i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, postSmith , having little problem actually applying Smith ’s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion. ... Close What the Court has done, though, is redraw the lines of engagement so that only a vanishingly small number of laws are now considered generally applicable, and laws that have nothing to do with religion are categorized as targeting religious belief or practice.",
