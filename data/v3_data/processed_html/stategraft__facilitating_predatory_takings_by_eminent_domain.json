      "text": "The concept of stategraft, as described in Professor Atuahene’s groundbreaking article, frames a new theory of corruption centered on criminal and predacious state action involving the transfer of personal property by government actors to the State, through means that violate controlling laws and contravene individuals’ human and civil rights. 1 While Professor Atuahene’s article introduces the concept of stategraft in the context of inflated property tax assessments, the theory is alienable and it offers a frame for corrupt and criminal conduct by state actors that enriches public coffers by other means and in other contexts. The litigation in Peoplestown, a historically Black neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia, illustrates the operation of stategraft through the exploitative use of eminent domain to facilitate gentrification of a vulnerable community of legacy residents, under the guise of engineering efforts that purportedly addressed area flooding. 2",

      "text": "In 2012, stormwater and raw sewage flooded several homes on a block in Peoplestown. 3 Recurrent flooding destroyed homes and personal property and nine affected families on a Peoplestown block of twenty-seven homes filed suit against the City of Atlanta. In settlement negotiations with these plaintiffs, the City made clear its intention to use eminent domain to take the entire block of homes, including the majority of homes that did not flood. The City successfully settled the cases with the plaintiffs and convinced other residents on the block, who were not parties to the lawsuit, to sell their homes to the City against the backdrop of the eminent domain threat. The City advanced persistent flooding as a justification for a project that would replace homes with Japanese-themed parks and ponds, complete with tree-lined walking paths, a waterfall, and an educational kiosk/gazebo. 4",

      "text": "In 2016, the City of Atlanta filed four separate lawsuits against the Peoplestown residents who refused to sell their homes to the City, including the author of this article. 5 In the course of the litigation, which spanned six years, evidence surfaced that confirmed the City did not have engineering data to support its exercise of the extraordinary power of eminent domain. 6 A 2013 email authored by a former City of Atlanta engineer who was the project manager for the park and pond project informed, “Did you also inform Commissioner Macrina that the present modeling results do not validate the need for a retention pond in Peoplestown? The take away [sic] is that the City doesn’t have the technical data to support the proposed land acquisition and proposed design underway.” 7 Notwithstanding incontrovertible evidence that the City’s motivations for taking residents’ homes were groundless, the litigation continued. After ten years of city-wide public resistance, the City paid historic settlements to the residents without ever producing engineering data supporting the takings. 8",

      "text": "Because “[s]tategraft places the focus where it belongs, which is on the actual theft [of property] and its impact on vulnerable populations,” the theory provides the perfect framework for examining the predatory and racialized use of eminent domain and its foreseeable and harmful consequences. 9 This course of action accurately describes how environmental projects (like flood mitigation initiatives) are advanced by government officials to justify replacing Black and brown faces with green spaces through the use of eminent domain. These projects, which in some states include economic development projects designed to enrich private individuals and companies, are under some state laws presumed to satisfy eminent domain’s public purpose requirement and condemnees find efforts to resist the taking of their property frustrated by tight deadlines for filing responsive pleadings, limited discovery, and evidentiary obstacles that are expensive and challenging to clear. 10 Accordingly, vulnerable individuals and communities, like Peopletown and its residents, are likely to be targets of stategraft in the eminent domain context.",

      "text": "Augmenting stategraft in the form of legal procedural and substantive limits designed to frustrate property owners’ efforts to resist takings and corrupt and illegal action by state actors, is a shift in federal policies and funding that facilitates and incentivizes the use of eminent domain by cities and counties. The taking of homes in Peoplestown in 2016 aligned with a new federal policy announced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) in 2015. In what can accurately be characterized as a Faustian bargain, USACE policy changed local governments’ federally funded buyout programs in flood-prone areas from entirely voluntary to mandating that local governments’ funded acquisition efforts include the use of eminent domain. 11 This policy will continue to render communities like Peoplestown and its residents vulnerable to federally sanctioned, funded, and locally implemented stategraft. 12",
