United States was not well received. 4 A primary criticism has been that the Court’s ruling portends a “lawless presidency.” 5 This criticism, I will argue, rests on a misleading picture of how the criminal law operates inside the executive branch. Many factors other than the President’s vulnerability to criminal law inform executive branch compliance with criminal law. One can certainly imagine a bad-man President after Trump engaging in widespread lawless criminal behavior. But, unfortunately, the bad-man President had many tools to skirt the criminal law before Trump , to which its uncertain immunity ruling added relatively little.",

But its impact will have less to do with the Court’s immunity rulings than with its related rulings on the President’s exclusive removal power and exclusive power over investigation and prosecution. These rulings, which were novel, expansive, and undertheorized, will play themselves out in litigation about the scope of presidential power for years. This Article, however, will mainly explore the slightly more tractable impact of the decision beyond judicial review and inside the executive branch, which will deploy the decision to help the President overcome legal constraints and win disputes with Congress.",

Nixon , the Court stated that “[w]hen judicial action is needed to serve broad public interests … the exercise of jurisdiction has been held warranted.” 24 But, it concluded that in a “merely private suit for damages based on a President’s official acts,” 25 the President receives the broad absolute immunity due to his important “discretionary responsibilities” and the extraordinary burden that inferior presidential immunity would entail. 26",

Nixon expressed this limitation in terms of a presidential presumptive privilege against disclosure of presidential communications in court. The limits on congressional power contemplated by Youngstown go to the legality of presidential action, while the limit on judicial review contemplated by Nixon v.

United States oral argument. 30 Rather, they rested on “constitutional underpinnings,” as the tapes case put it in the context of presidential communications. 31 And the Nixon opinions did not mention the views of the Founders, original public meaning, or any other originalist indicator of meaning. 32",

Rather, Jackson described the President’s exclusive authority as the resolution of a clash of powers between the executive and other branches. 35 The Nixon opinions were overtly anti-formalist.

Trump was a highly unusual case because these interests were potentially in tension. 46 The Biden Administration had an interest in prosecuting the former President for his alleged crimes.

Garland appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith on November 18, 2022, “[b]ased on recent developments, including the former President’s announcement that he is a candidate for President in the next election, and the sitting President’s stated intention to be a candidate as well.” Merrick B. Garland, Att’y Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Just., Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks on the Appointment of a Special Counsel (Nov. 18, 2022), https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-appointment-special-counsel . Smith retained many lawyers and investigators who had worked on the January 6 case prior to his appointment and hired new staff. Perry Stein, A Look at the Team Jack Smith Built to Try to Convict Donald Trump , Wash. Post (Sept. 10, 2023), https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/10/jack-smith-special-counsel-trump-investigations . Under Justice Department regulations, Smith had the powers of a U.S. Attorney and had to “comply” with Department rules and policies and “consult” with appropriate Department offices about them. 28 C.F.R. § 600.6–7(a) (2022). The Attorney General retained the authority to request from the Special Counsel “an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step,” and the power to “conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” Id. § 600.7(b). A Special Counsel is thus quasi-independent from the Attorney General, who is constitutionally subject to presidential direction but by virtue of norms—at least through the presidency of Joseph Biden—is independent of the White House.

Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983). A formalist approach to separation of powers identifies whether the exercise of governmental power is legislative, executive, or judicial, and that identification determines which branch may exercise the power. See, e.g. , Gary S. Lawson, Territorial Governments and the Limits of Formalism , 78 Calif. L. Rev. 853, 857–88 (1990). By contrast, a functionalist approach recognizes that the three branches do not “operate with absolute independence,” Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988) (quoting Nixon , 418 U.S. at 707), and that the Constitution requires only “safeguard[ing] against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other,” id. at 693 (quoting Buckley v.

      "text": "40 Trump filed four motions to dismiss in the district court, none of which raised congressional separation of powers or Youngstown Category Three issues. The motion to dismiss the indictment based on presidential immunity focused only on the line of cases involving immunity from federal judicial adjudication and did not raise separation of powers restraints on Congress. It mentioned Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence only to emphasize that the President’s organizing a slate of electors was an independent power in Jackson’s Category Two, and it did not claim an exclusive and preclusive power in Category Three. Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on Presidential Immunity, supra note 1, at 44 n.7; see also Reply Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Presidential Immunity, United States v. Trump, 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (D.D.C. 2023) (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 122. The motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds mentioned separation of powers and the Youngstown majority opinion only in arguing that government could not second-guess Trump’s acquittal on articles of impeachment. Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Constitutional Grounds and Memorandum in Support at 23, Trump , 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 113. The motion to dismiss on statutory grounds raised First Amendment constitutional avoidance arguments but none about the separation of powers. Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Statutory Grounds and Memorandum in Support at 16–23, Trump , 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 114. The motion to dismiss for selective and vindictive prosecution did not raise separation of powers issues at all. See Motion to Dismiss for Selective and Vindictive Prosecution, Trump , 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 116. The Trump brief before the D.C. Circuit also did not raise separation of powers constraints on Congress or Youngstown Category Three issues. See Opening Brief of Defendant-Appellant President Donald J. Trump, Trump , 91 F.4th 1173 (No. 23-3228), 2023 WL 8874627; Reply Brief of Defendant-Appellant President Donald J. Trump, Trump , 91 F.4th 1173 (No. 23-3228), 2024 WL 36166. Trump’s failure to discuss Category Three constraints on congressional power in the courts below is especially remarkable because the government had hinted at such constraints as a basis for immunity. See, e.g. , Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on Presidential Immunity Grounds at 35, Trump , 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 109. One might speculate that Trump’s lawyers declined to raise the issue of separation of powers vis-à-vis Congress because they viewed the argument as a defense on the merits to be raised at a different time and perhaps did not want to raise the issue at the motion to dismiss stage for fear that they would not be able to raise Harlow -type immunity on interlocutory appeal. But this speculation is implausible since, as explained above, the Trump team raised many other issues in the motions to dismiss that were clearly defenses and could clearly be appealed only after trial. In addition, as Justice Barrett wrote in her concurrence, there was a powerful argument that the separation of powers claim, even if a defense, was still subject to interlocutory review. See Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 651–55 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring in part); infra note 67 and accompanying text.",

The Chief Justice replied that “the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact that the President performed the official act” and “may admit evidence of what the President allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to receive or accept in return for being influenced in the performance of the act” but may not “admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.” Id. at 632 n.3 (majority opinion).
