[5] The parties’ goal was to eliminate the need for injections by developing a pill to transport medicine into a patient’s bloodstream before the patient’s digestive system broke the pill’s components down. [6] Though Eli Lilly was a manufacturer, it brought marketing expertise to the collaboration; Emisphere brought technical expertise. The parties agreed to share information, [7] to work together through the anticipated multi-year project, and to use a dispute-resolution system that required senior management of both companies to resolve difficulties jointly. [8] The arrangement focused on a particular compound—parathyroid hormone (PTH)—as an initial vehicle. [9] If the collaboration was successful, Eli Lilly would market a pill using PTH. Otherwise, Lilly had no right “to use the Emisphere Technology or Emisphere Program Technology other than insofar as they relate directly to the Field [i.e., the project] and are expressly granted herein.” [10] After several years, the arrangement broke down before the parties developed a pill to deliver PTH. The court agreed with Emisphere’s argument “that Lilly breached the final sentence in [the] provision [limiting Lilly’s rights] . . . by carrying out secret, independent research projects using Emisphere’s carriers with proteins other than PTH.” [11]",

Rather, the RCOA created a structure to govern the parties’ collaboration. Further, the parties’ dispute-resolution process required the parties to negotiate but did not specify the consequences of negotiation failure. The case, however, is unusual because it was in court at all.

Few cases exist because contract law does not offer solutions to the problems of opportunism, exploitation, and differences of belief regarding project success that attend joint-development arrangements. As a result, an important segment of the U.S. economy functions today without a contract law. The justification for a state-supplied contract law, however, is that the law enables parties to make transactions that the parties would otherwise forgo. Collaborations performed well in the extraordinary circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. But an implication of contract law’s absence is that the American economy underproduces productive collaborations in ordinary times. It is this possibility that poses the two tasks we address in this Article: to explain why today’s contract law offers courts no tools for facilitating the new collaborations, and to begin to create a contract law for the facilitation of those collaborations. In pursuing these tasks, it is helpful to start by comparing the new collaborations to more traditional transactions.",

Later in the twentieth century, sellers began to make goods to suit particular buyers’ needs, but again the buyers did not participate in production. The contracts that governed trade of these specialized products were also simple. A contract would describe the functions the specialized goods were supposed to perform, set a performance schedule, and, sometimes, specify a remedy for the seller’s breach.

Parties conduct deals today under agreements that are not contracts as the Restatements define contracts; [20] rather, they are “framework agreements” that describe the cooperative behavior in which parties agree to engage. Many of the tasks that a framework agreement assigns to a party—e.g., exploring marketing opportunities—are not observable by the other party, but the task structure itself has a public component. For example, a framework agreement would not require a party to execute a particular task optimally when the counterparty could not observe how the party performed the task, but the agreement will require the party to report a task result. Reports are observable. In consequence of the exploratory nature of the parties’ project, framework agreements also do not set prices or specify quantities at early stages. This is because parties cannot precisely predict the cost and value of what they may ultimately produce. Finally, parties intend their framework agreements to be “self-enforcing”—that is, each party expects the other to comply independently of the state’s power to enforce. These commercial arrangements, together with the framework agreements that govern them, constitute what we call “new-economy collaborations.” [21]",

[22] The principal contract law response to breach is to protect the promisee’s expectation interest. [23] The expectation remedy facilitates exchange efficiency in two ways. [24] First, the remedy replicates the efficient transaction. The disappointed promisee-buyer receives a sum equal to the value the promisee-buyer expected to derive from the trade, or the disappointed promisee-seller receives a sum equal to the profit the promisee-seller expected to make. The expectation remedy thus puts the promisee in the same position financially that it would have occupied had the promisor performed. [25] Second, the expectation remedy permits parties to reallocate their resources efficiently when a deal turns out to be inefficient to conclude. A promisor thus may trade with a higher-valuing buyer on paying the promisee its expectation, thereby making the promisor better off without making the promisee worse off.",

For example, a court cannot award a disappointed seller its profit unless the court can observe the contract price and the seller’s production cost. Prices are convenient for courts to observe; cost and value are sometimes not. The expectation remedy therefore facilitates exchange efficiency best in developed markets in which goods trade at their market prices. [26] Contract law also protects investment efficiency in developed markets because the disappointed promisee can resell to or repurchase from another market participant. Because the market provides parties with satisfactory substitutes for failed deals, the contract seller will invest to minimize its costs and the contract buyer will invest to maximize its value.

Because there is no market price for a specialized product, courts must observe actual values and costs in order to determine whether the seller invested as it promised and to measure the buyer’s loss from breach. An informed court is necessary because parties have incentives to shade performance. Thus, a seller who is guaranteed the price may underinvest in performing the customization task, and a buyer who is guaranteed the goods’ value may overinvest in increasing that value. Without being able to observe the investment level each party chose (or whether the investment was optimal), a court cannot deter such strategic behavior.

In the new economy, by contrast, parties agree to develop jointly, in multistage collaborations, either a product to trade to third parties or a product that is tailored to the contract buyer’s needs. Thus, in the new economy, “breach” consists of not performing unobservable assigned tasks, not performing the tasks that the public aspects of a framework agreement require, otherwise withholding or wrongfully exploiting private information, or just exiting before the end. Contract law cannot respond effectively to such breaches because the expectation remedy is conditioned on price, cost, quantity, and value. When a party defects from a new-economy collaboration early on or at the implementation stage, the development process is unfinished: parties have incurred costs but do not have a product. Hence, they do not have a price, nor can they predict product costs, how much they will trade, or ultimate transaction value. A disappointed buyer, say, cannot recover the difference between the product’s value and the price, when value is yet to be determined and there is no price.",

To see why, suppose that a traditional-economy seller can produce specialized goods only by making a sunk-cost investment—that is, for example, by modifying its facilities so that the facilities can best produce the specialized product. After the seller invests, the parties bargain to set a price for the new product. The bargain will not compensate the seller for its relationship-specific investment because future-oriented bargains ignore sunk costs. Anticipating being “held up” by the buyer, the seller will not make the sunk-cost investment. This is an unrealistic example for the traditional economy, however, because the seller can protect itself by obtaining a legally binding promise from the buyer to pay the price. [31] In contrast, in new-economy collaborations, parties must make exploratory and productive investments in order to see whether a new product is feasible and, if so, to create it. These investments are specific to the possible deal and parties must make them before contractual protection is possible. Therefore, new-economy sellers are more subject to holdup than traditional-economy sellers are. This is an important reason why new collaborations are probably underproduced.",

We suggest that reliance should be the default remedy when parties begin a transaction but one of them inappropriately defects. There are two reasons for this suggestion. First, as just stated, an expectation remedy may be impossible to implement when the variables on which it conditions are unknown. The second reason is more subtle: expectation damages, if a party could prove them, exceed reliance damages because parties expect a transaction’s gain to exceed its costs. However, when both parties are highly uncertain about whether a deal will come to fruition but are certain that they will incur substantial costs in finding out, they often prefer being insured against the nontrivial probability that exploratory costs will be wasted to being insured against the much lower probability of not realizing expectation gains. Thus, a reliance remedy is often more likely to encourage participation in a new-economy collaboration than the expectation remedy, even when an expectation is provable. [32]",

Defection can occur for several reasons, set out in subpart I(C) of this Article, but a particularly important cause of a possible breakup is that parties may come to have different beliefs regarding the efficient path forward and about the adequacy of the framework agreement as written to direct the right path to success. Recalling that parties intend framework agreements to be self-enforcing, parties today address the defection problem in two ways. Their principal method is to make a party’s continuation payoff exceed its defection payoff. For example, a framework agreement may enable a compliant party to access the intellectual property their arrangement created but deny access to a defecting party.

First, the prohibition against penalties should be relaxed so that courts enforce framework-agreement sanctions.

There should be a new contract-reformation doctrine [33] that would permit courts to reform a contract not only to correct a mistake of fact made at the time of formation but also to reform a framework agreement so that it reflects the efficient course forward in light of what has come to be known ex post . Traditional contract interpretation occurs after a breach, while the “midstream” reformation we propose would prevent breach by permitting a court to adapt the parties’ contractual mechanism to changing circumstances. [34] Finally, cooperation may fail even when parties hold consistent beliefs. For example, a party’s outside option may improve so that defection becomes more attractive. We suggest an extension of the specific-performance rules for such cases.

Parties, however, can design a “revelation mechanism” to induce each of them to disclose payoff-relevant information.

But because the scholarly focus has been on how collaborations succeed, little attention has been paid to the question of how collaborations fail. Deal failure, however, is an ever-present possibility, [40] and it is the possibility on which lawyers should focus. Thus, we ask a largely original question: how can contract law increase the probability that parties enter new-economy collaborations and efficiently implement them? In addressing this question, we become the first to propose a legal infrastructure for modern relational contracts. [41]",

For example, a court could require each party to produce reports of the ex post state of the world and fine parties when their reports differ. [42] This mechanism can induce accurate reports, which the court could disclose to both parties. The parties then could renegotiate to the ex post efficient state because the parties would be symmetrically informed. These schemes are obviously unrealistic, but the basic contract-theory insight holds: efficiency would improve if courts participate during a collaboration rather than pick up the pieces after.

Initially, courts can respond to the parties’ epistemic conflict arising from inconsistent beliefs by reforming their contract so that it reflects the efficient path forward. And where realigning party beliefs is insufficient to keep parties on that path, the court can mandate cooperation by requiring adherence to the framework agreement. Adjudication will refine these remedies, but we stress the central point: new-economy collaborations require new roles for common law courts. [44]",

We add to this toolkit new default legal remedies [45] that parties could use when the remedies would increase the parties’ ability to induce entry into and compliance with a framework agreement. When one party is weak (i.e., when the parties have unequal bargaining power), this empowerment also might have distributive effects, facilitating collaborations that otherwise would not take place when the weaker party lacks access to self-enforcing reputational mechanisms.",

Under collaboration, parties invest in learning about their collaborators’ capacities, preferences, and needs. These investments increase the probability that parties can cooperate to produce something new, but they also erect barriers to either party taking advantage of its partner. For an example of how such a barrier functions, suppose that the larger the stock of knowledge a party has about its counterparty, the lower the marginal cost of continuing to work with the counterparty is. It follows that defecting from a framework arrangement to pursue a similar project with another firm would initially be more costly than continuing with the current partner. Because the potential defector has no stock of knowledge about the new firm, it would have to incur high startup costs again. Denote the difference between the initial high marginal cost a new relationship would require and the low marginal cost of staying with the contract partner as a “switching cost.” [77] Investment in learning about the counterparty thus facilitates cooperation within a framework collaboration by creating switching costs that would attend defection. Parties actually design their framework process to create “coordination cascades,” where the specific investment of one party requires coordination with the other, whose response then requires further coordination with the first party.

We summarize these reasons under the heading “asymmetric information” because commercial parties commonly reason to the same result when they observe the same data. In this subsection, we make the asymmetric-information explanation for inefficient breakups more precise and argue that a modified reformation remedy would reduce them.",

The buyer produces intermediate goods: products that the buyer sells to end users. The buyer believes that a potential seller–maker could produce a machine that would be compatible with the buyer’s existing factory setup and would increase output efficiently. Because such a machine is yet to exist, the buyer recognizes that it could come in various versions, each of which would affect the buyer’s return differently. We denote the buyer’s use of possible versions as buyer “types.” The set of such types is X i , where i can take on any value from one to infinity. For example, we write a buyer’s use of a possible type three machine as type X 3 . Importantly, each type is multidimensional. Thus, an X 3 machine would run at a certain rate, require servicing at particular intervals, need particular safety devices, and so on.

Second, those remedies should be stage-relevant—that is, new-economy transactions occur in stages, and the parties to them have different goals and incentives to defect at each stage, so facilitative remedies should differ with the stage. Third, we develop stage-relevant remedies. Each of them would require a major extension of current contract doctrine. We understand that once courts begin to implement these remedies, they will undergo a common law development, so that settled new-economy doctrine likely would come to differ from our proposals here. This is the fate of successful generative efforts.",

We do not consider these sales for two reasons. First, our subject is the business contract. More basically, this Article works in the space in which it is empirically plausible to attribute rationality to the contracting parties. Such an attribution may require justification or modification when one of the parties is an individual person. See, e.g. , Alan Schwartz, Regulating for Rationality , 67 Stan. L.

Also, though the deal vehicle is the internet, the typical sale is a traditional-economy transaction which, as defined above, occurs when the firm sells finished goods to an individual consumer in a one-stage transaction under a simple contract. We also do not consider how firms perform when embedded in networks because our focus is procurement—a task networks seldom are created to achieve.

Note that in game theory models, the information sets off the equilibrium path are reached with probability zero by definition. Hence, we cannot apply Bayes’ formula to compute off-the-equilibrium path beliefs (that is, attempting to apply Bayes’ rule produces an undefined expression). Nevertheless, if players learn how to behave off the equilibrium path, they can sustain the equilibrium over time. But when parties do not know how to behave off the equilibrium path, inefficiency will generally occur. See Yves Breitmoser, Jonathan H.W.

Projections of predictable events are impaired by “bounded rationality,” which are limits on the ability to calculate optimal strategies. See John Geanakoplos, An Introduction to General Equilibrium with Incomplete Asset Markets , 19 J. Mathematical Econ. 1, 2 n.1 (1990) (“[One] reason that asset markets are incomplete has to do with the bounded rationality of the agents. It is impossible to think of all the future contingencies it would be necessary to specify to have complete asset markets.”). Note that bounded rationality is different from irrationality, under which the agents in the economy make systematic mistakes and cannot exactly anticipate the central moment of distributions. Conversely, under bounded rationality, the agents are rational but have computational limitations. Bounded rationality is one of the working assumptions of the literature of incomplete markets. See Michael Magill & Martine Quinzii , 1 Theory of Incomplete Markets 12–13 (1996) (identifying bounded rationality as one of the axioms on which transactions-cost literature is based).",

The buyer wants to complete a transaction with probability, p (not to be confounded with the p with subscript indicating the price in supra note 122), and the seller wants to complete the transaction with probability, q . We assume that p and q are independently realized. In practice, there may be some correlation between the parties’ probability estimates, but if the probabilities were perfectly correlated, the parties could never disagree about whether to perform the contract or not. That probabilities are independent implies that they may differ: the seller and buyer could have different beliefs at the outset—different “priors”—about whether their deal will succeed. Now, under the first approach to the parties’ investment behavior, a party’s investment affects only the substantive variables: value, v , and cost, c . For example, the buyer’s investment, r , increases its value (i.e., v ( r )) but does not affect the probability that the buyer assigns to deal completion. Thus, we treat the parties’ probability estimates as constants. Under the second approach, a party’s investment affects the probability it assigns to deal completion but does not affect the value of the substantive variables (e.g., p ( r ) and q ( s ) for the buyer and seller respectively where s is the seller’s specific investment). Here, we treat the variables v and c as constants. The two approaches yield similar qualitative results because both parameters are concave in investment. This means that, under the first approach, the buyer’s value is increasing in its investment but at a decreasing rate, and that, under the second approach, the probability of completing the deal is increasing in the buyer’s investment but at a decreasing rate, and similarly for the seller. Concavity implies that there is an interior solution at the optimum for a party’s investment program.",

The naïve buyer maximizes v ( r ) – k – r , where k is the contract price, so it invests until v’ ( r ) = 1. The sophisticated buyer recognizes that it will perform with probability p < 1, so it maximizes p ( v ( r ) – k ) – r , where p is the probability of the buyer’s own performance. Thus, the buyer will invest until p ( v’’ ( r )) = 1, which is less than the naïve buyer. It would be socially efficient, however, for the buyer to consider the actual likelihood of the deal going through, which is the joint probability— pq —that both parties will prefer performance, where q is the probability the seller will want to perform. The efficient buyer thus maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) – r . The efficient level of investment, r* , therefore solves pq ( v’ ( r )) = 1.

Hence, both the buyer and the seller have incentives to take the possibility of their own defection into account. The buyer’s uncertainty implies that his value is v ( r ) with probability p < 1 and zero otherwise. The seller’s uncertainty implies that her cost is c ( s ) < v ( r ) with probability q < 1, which implies that its cost is c > v ( r ) with probability 1 – q . The buyer’s investment program, which is identical to the social planner’s program, should solve pq ( v ( r ) – k ) – r . The socially optimal relation-specific investment, r* , is then determined by the first-order condition (FOC): v’ ( r ) = 1/ pq . Under expectation damages, the buyer maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) + p (1 – q )( v ( r ) – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ) – r so the equilibrium investment, r ed , is determined by the FOC: v’ ( r ) = 1/ p , from which we have r ed > r* by the concavity of v ( r ). Under reliance damages, by contrast, the buyer maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) + p (1 – q )( r ) – (1 – p ) q ( s ) – r , where s is the seller’s specific investment. The equilibrium investment, r rd , is determined by the FOC: v’ ( r ) = (1 – p + pq )/ pq . Because 1/ pq > (1 – p + pq )/ pq , by the concavity of v ( r ), we have r rd > r*. Under the reliance remedy, there is still overinvestment. But because (1 – p + pq )/ pq > 1/ p , also by the concavity of v ( r ), we have r ed > r rd , which means that overinvestment is lower under the reliance remedy than under the expectation remedy. A similar argument applies for the seller.",

A technical discussion would be out of place, but the basic intuition is simple.

Now consider a game that includes an “observer” (e.g., a court) whose task is to recommend a strategy to each player. The observer will recommend a subset of strategies according to a probability distribution over the set of possible strategies, which the players commonly know. This probability distribution is called a correlated equilibrium if the strategy vector in which all players follow the observer’s recommendations is a Nash equilibrium—that is, if following the recommendations is the best response (the most efficient action) each player can take.",

When the buyer’s outside option is set to zero, the buyer’s expected return—which determines his willingness to participate in the transaction—under expectation damages is pq ( v – k ) + p (1 – q )( v – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ) – r F . The buyer’s expected return under reliance is pq ( v – k ) + p (1 – q ) r F – (1 – p ) q ( s F ) – r F . Reliance damages provide a greater incentive to participate than expectation damages when p (1 – q ) r F – (1 – p ) q ( s F ) > p (1 – q )( v – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ). Rearranging this expression yields the inequality in the text. The reader can also check that the seller’s condition that makes it prefer reliance is satisfied when q /(1 – q )( Π B – s F ) ≤ p (1 – p )( Π B – r F ) holds. Exploratory-specific investments for new collaborations are both fixed and continuous. One can define a fixed investment as the lower bound of a continuous investment, but it is more illuminating to regard fixed investments as necessary for the buyer (Firm A) and the seller (Firm B) to make in order to begin operations. A continuous investment increases the contract surplus once the relationship has begun. Note, however, that because damages are a zero-sum game—increasing one party’s damage payoff reduces the other party’s payoff—the buyer’s and seller’s conditions for preferring reliance over expectation damages sometimes cannot be satisfied simultaneously.",

Id. (manuscript at 20–22). To solve this problem, we suggest a novel interpretive procedure that applies to a wide variety of legal areas, including new collaborations. Parties should be able to obtain an “interim contract interpretation”—that is, a judicial interpretation of their contract at the renegotiation stage rather than after a breach occurs. Id. (manuscript at 26). A midstream interpretation, in the form of a declaratory judgment or a new reformation remedy, would permit parties to align their beliefs on the expected litigation payoffs and therefore to continue an arrangement they would otherwise inefficiently terminate, or efficiently terminate a relationship without bearing unnecessary performance or litigation costs. See id. (manuscript at 26–28) (discussing interim contract interpretation and providing an illustration to show the effects of having interim interpretation as a remedy).",

Arbitration clauses in commercial contracts generally incorporate by reference the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, which expressly allow the arbitrator to grant specific performance of a contract, but are silent with regard to penalties, fines, or punitive damages.

Whether an arbitrator’s award of equitable remedies or punitive damages will be judicially enforceable, however, may depend on whether the arbitration is governed by state law or by the Federal Arbitration Act.
