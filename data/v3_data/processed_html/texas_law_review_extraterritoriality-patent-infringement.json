[2] It is not surprising that with the advancement of technology, the role of the semiconductor has become even more essential in our society—it is a building block from which current and emerging technologies are developed. Semiconductors are the basis of nearly all industrial, commercial, and military systems—almost everything in the modern world relies in some way on semiconductor technologies. [3] For instance, semiconductors can be found in cellular devices, computers, pacemakers, cars, and many common household items. [4] And our reliance on semiconductor technology is not expected to diminish any time soon. [5] As such, semiconductors—and the behavior of semiconductor firms—have been a central focus of domestic policy. [6]",

[8] In particular, the Court seems to have an interest in the intersection of patent law and extraterritoriality, [9] the same intersection explored at the heart of this Note. Extraterritorial application of law is “the competence of a State to apply its laws to foreign entities in relation to their, often purely foreign, conduct.” [10] Specifically, in the United States, this refers to “the extension of federal law to activity outside the territorial confines of the United States.” [11] Despite language in the Patent Act expressing territorial limits, [12] U.S. patent law has traditionally been extended outside of domestic contexts. [13] The question is: How far do the territorial boundaries reach? This Note explores the tension between the presumption against extraterritoriality and the common-law notions of causation and full compensation. [14]",

[18] As business becomes more international, domestic acts of patent infringement are increasingly impacting foreign markets and resulting in lost profits abroad. [19] The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court have recently addressed extraterritoriality in relation to patent damages. [20] In particular, the courts have analyzed whether patentees can recover extraterritorial damages arising from infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) and § 271(f), which define direct infringement of a U.S. patent and infringement arising out of the exportation of components of a patented invention from the United States, respectively.",

The analytical framework discussed in Part I is woven throughout much of the courts’ reasonings as they attempt to define the territorial boundaries of patent law. In analyzing the Federal Circuit’s treatment of extraterritorial damages, Part II then considers the extent to which the Supreme Court’s recent decision in WesternGeco II has impacted subsequent lower court decisions. Lastly, Part III calls for a serious consideration of the impact that these judicial decisions may have on the semiconductor industry. It begins by providing an overview of the semiconductor industry and ultimately concludes that the extraterritorial application of patent damages should be permitted in cases of direct infringement occurring within the United States.",

[24] Under this presumption, “[a]bsent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.” [25] Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption “applies with particular force in patent law” [26] and that “[o]ur patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect.” [27]",

First, it is “heavily grounded in international law and the principle of prescriptive comity.” [29] Specifically, the presumption “serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.” [30] Second, in a similar vein, the presumption attempts to mitigate issues with conflict of laws by following another key canon of statutory interpretation: federal statutes should be construed so as not to conflict with international law. [31] Thus, the Court applies the presumption to avoid “difficult issues of international law” [32] and to “avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations.” [33]",

In RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community , [40] the Court addressed the question of whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act applied extraterritorially. [41] The Court applied a two-step methodology to assess the scope and reach of the racketeering statute. Incorporating the presumption against extraterritoriality, the first step determines “whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted—that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially.” [42] If such indication exists, then the presumption is overcome, and the statute is granted extraterritorial reach within the limits imposed by Congress. [43] However, absent any clear indication from Congress rebutting the presumption, a court should “determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute . . . by looking to the statute’s ‘focus.’” [44] Specifically:",

For instance, a patentee can seek price erosion damages if it was forced to lower prices to remain competitive with the infringing product. [61] Or, under the entire-market-value rule, if the accused product involves only one component of a larger device, it is possible for the patentee to recover lost profits for the entire device.

[127] Thus, to determine the territorial scope of § 284, the Court then “look[ed] to the type of infringement that occurred.” [128] The basis of the patentee’s infringement claim and lost-profits damages was § 271(f)(2), a statute the Court found to be primarily focused on domestic conduct.
