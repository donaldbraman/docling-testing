For much of the past five decades, since the emergence of modern environmental statutory law in the 1970s, the evolving process of environmental lawmaking prompted courts and legislatures to reconcile the inevitable conflicts generated between new environmental laws and pre-existing, cross-cutting areas of law by making the latter more accommodating to the former. This was evident in evolving principles of administrative law, constitutional law, corporate law, and criminal law during that time, all of which changed in ways to make environmental protection law more effective.

NEPA requires that federal agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for any proposals for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” [18] There was no dispute here that an EIS was required. There was the requisite federal agency (the Surface Transportation Board). That agency was proposing a major federal action (permitting the 88-mile extension of an existing freight rail line in Utah to facilitate development and production of waxy crude oil in the Uinta Basin—the geographic area to be served by that rail line). [19] And that railway line, if permitted, would result in significant adverse environmental effects. [20] There was similarly no dispute under established Supreme Court precedent that the EIS need not consider all the “but for” adverse consequences of the proposed Board action to be adequate. [21]",

These are “upstream” consequences. [26] After all, the very purpose of the railway line was to promote that increased oil production activity. [27] Looking outside the geographic boundaries of the project, other possible adverse environmental effects would be to look “downstream” of the project to the increased railway traffic the new railway line might cause outside its own 88-mile length, including railway accidents and oil spills. [28] Finally, even further removed in time and space, the effects might include the increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by the refining of the crude oil once it reached its final destination hundreds of miles away in the Gulf States.

Whatever one thinks of the merits of the legal argument supporting the Clean Power Plan, the upholding of its repeal in West Virginia deprived the federal government of the authority to adopt what amounted to the most common sense, cost-effective, fair, and efficient program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from one of the nation’s largest sources of such emissions. Perhaps even more devastating, however, was the enormous reduction in Sackett of the geographic scope of the Clean Water Act. [106] In West Virginia, unlike in Sackett , EPA was trying to craft a new, bold, and to some extent unprecedented interpretation of a federal act to address a new problem. In Sackett , however, no such claim could be made about the government’s position. The Court rejected the government’s fifty-year view of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdictional reach. [107] In its stead, the Court insisted on an unduly rigid textual interpretation [108] that ignored the realities of water, making it impossible for the government to protect the nation’s waters as the Act had contemplated.",

In all the other recent cases, the environmentalists Achilles’ heel was the absence of clear congressional text in favor of their (and often also EPA’s) position. For instance, in West Virginia , the policy merits of the Clean Power Plan were overwhelming, but the argument that the relevant Clean Air Act provision enacted fifty years earlier allowed for the Plan was less so. In Sackett , the need for a broad definition of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction reach was compelling and supported by five decades of practice, but Congress’s invocation of the word “navigable” created a genuine legal issue. In Loper Bright , the undeniable need for judicial deference to agency expertise was clear, but it became harder to defend with increasingly old statutes, as Congress had dropped out of any significant amendment of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, hazardous waste law, or the Endangered Species Act for more than thirty years.",

Public Citizen , effects the agency had the legal authority to control in making its decision.

With the perception that NEPA may now be interfering with climate goals, a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2023 to amend the law, even if amending only part of the law makes little sense in light of the rest of the law left unchanged.

That is necessarily true about discerning historical, evolutionary trends. No one isolated moment tells the full story.

And, of course, it is being tested to an unprecedented extent by a President who, unable to erase the federal environmental statutes on the books, seeks to create a legal revolution akin to the antithesis of that which created environmental law in the 1970s―by destroying the federal government agencies’ ability to administer that law through massive freezing of previously appropriated funding, future budget cuts, layoffs, and destruction of career employee morale, [200] and by relying on the Court’s recent rulings to justify eliminating all Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order purportedly authorizing the President’s Council on Environmental Quality, which was itself created by NEPA, to issue such binding regulations. See Exec. Order No. 11,991, 42 Fed. Reg. 26967 (May 24, 1977). For decades, CEQ did just that and the Court deferred within normal bounds to the CEQ regulations. See Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 357–58 (1979). More recently, however, some courts have called into question the validity of President Carter’s authority to confer on CEQ such rulemaking authority, Iowa v. Council on Env’t Quality, 765 F. Supp. 3d 859 (D.N.D. 2025), and President Trump has revoked that administrative order. Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8355 (Jan. 20, 2025). CEQ has in turn eliminated its CEQ regulations entirely, see Removal of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 10610 (Feb. 25, 2025) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. pts. 1500, 1501, 1502, 1503, 1504, 1506, 1507, 1508) (CEQ interim final rule), and agencies charged with complying with NEPA, like the Department of the Interior, have taken the further step of converting their own NEPA regulations into guidelines not published in the Code of Federal Regulations except for a few provisions intended to make NEPA compliance easier. See National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 29498 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 43 C.F.R. pt. 46) (Interior interim final rule). No doubt that is why neither of the two Supreme Court opinions in Seven County reference the CEQ NEPA regulations in force at the time of the Surface Transportation Board’s drafting of its EIS. Indeed, remarkably, neither opinion even refers to CEQ at all.",

      "text": ". The Court’s ruling in Seven County , however, adds a new, interesting twist on Loper Bright . To justify its holding that courts should defer to a federal agency’s decision on the proper boundaries for an EIS’s consideration of a proposed agency action’s environmental effects, the majority felt compelled to explain that the deference would not be to the agency’s legal interpretation of a statutory term within NEPA but instead “[f]or the most part” to the agency’s factual determination of “what details need to be included in any given EIS.” See Seven Cnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle County, 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1512 (2025). According to the Court, “whether a particular report is detailed enough in a particular case itself requires the exercise of agency discretion―which should not be excessively second-guessed by a court.” Id. The majority analogizes this kind of judicial determination to “whether the agency action was reasonable and reasonably explained” as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, thereby warranting application of that same Act’s “deferential arbitrary-and-capricious” standard consistent with Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Id. at 1511. As the Court’s inclusion of the caveat “for the most part” readily acknowledges, the distinction here of Loper Bright is a bit messy. Sometimes an agency is not merely assessing facts. Its determination of what facts are relevant can naturally be framed as turning on a question of law, including the meaning of statutory terms such as “environmental effects” and “detailed” in NEPA. For this reason, some may view Seven County as cutting back on Loper Bright , while others may view Seven County as simply making clear the longstanding distinction between judicial review of statutory interpretation under Chevron and judicial review of agency factual assessments under State Farm .",
