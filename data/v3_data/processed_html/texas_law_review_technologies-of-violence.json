But at the most basic level, guns are a technology designed to inflict violence, whether for good (as in justified self-defense) or for ill (as in criminal or negligent misuse). And because guns are so effective in that task, their prevalence helps account for the disproportionate deadliness of violence in the United States. [1] In 2021, nearly 50,000 Americans died of gun shots—the highest number ever recorded by the CDC. [2] Those harms are not randomly distributed—men and people of color are especially likely to die [3] —and they come in different forms with different causes, including homicides, [4] impulsive suicides, [5] officer-involved killings, [6] school shootings, [7] and shootings by and of children (for whom gunshots are now the single leading cause of death).

[18] What differentiates American violence is not violence’s pervasiveness but its severity—in any given violent encounter, Americans are much more likely to be killed or seriously injured, due to the prevalence of guns in those encounters. [19] Scholars refer to this as the instrumentality effect, [20] and have shown that, for example, gun robberies are three times more likely to result in death than knife robberies, [21] and “.38 caliber attacks are more than twice as deadly as .22 caliber attacks.” [22] One cannot understand or address this violence without accounting for the technology that intensifies it, and accordingly much of our analysis here will focus on firearms.",

That very power is also a means of preventing violence through self-defense, which is the primary reason for gun ownership in the United States today.

It follows that violence technologies also encompass innovations designed to resist or mitigate the harms that weapons can inflict, such as bulletproof vests, metal detectors, and even bulletproof school desks. There are, of course, many other ways in which violence might be controlled—law and norms, for example, which themselves might be innovative—but we restrict our focus here to tangible instruments.",

New pharmaceuticals might treat one disease while simultaneously causing other health problems. But with firearms, it is harder to separate the primary function from the side effects since—as far as the instrument is concerned—the point is to threaten or inflict violence either way. The context, not the technology, determines whether the effect is good or bad, like a mis-prescribed drug rather than one with bad side effects. The primary question for firearms, then, is not whether the technology “works” but the relative prevalence of their misuse. [106]",

Both sides generally begin with some shared premises: that unjustified gun violence is bad and public safety is good. But they have fundamentally contradictory prescriptions about how to get less of the bad and more of the good, since the product one side sees as the problem, the other side sees as the solution. [107] That makes the debate difficult but not necessarily intractable. Guns have their own political and legal baggage, to be sure, but they fit within a broader category of products that are inherently dangerous—where some degree of danger is part of the function—and nonetheless should be made as safely as possible. The same is true of table saws, meat slicers, and even chemotherapy drugs. Just as chemotherapy should kill cancerous cells while harming as few healthy cells as possible, guns should be dangerous (in the sense of being powerful and effective) when appropriately used in justified self-defense, and safe (ineffective) when in the hands of an unsupervised toddler.",

For what uses? Taken literally, the test would permit the gun industry to expand the category of constitutionally protected “Arms” simply by flooding the market with a new model of weapon or accessory before the government can effectively regulate it.
