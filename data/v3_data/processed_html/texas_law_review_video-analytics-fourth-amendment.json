[1] Surveillance cameras feed video monitors, sensors alert to unusual activities, automated license plate readers scan passing cars, gunshot detection systems report loud sounds, and community-aided dispatch calls animate a central command center. [2] The fusion of various technologies allows real time response to emergencies and retrospective investigation into past crimes. Real-Time Crime Centers have been promoted as the next evolution of law enforcement and promise a central surveillance hub of police intelligence to monitor big and small cities alike. [3]",

[4] Video analytics (also known as computer vision) involves hardware and software in cameras that turn those constant video surveillance streams into useful data, identifying, categorizing, matching, and alerting police about objects, people, and incidents. [5] Powering that video analytics is artificial intelligence (AI) that allows for sophisticated pattern-matching technologies to work through vast quantities of information. [6] An otherwise overwhelming volume of city data becomes searchable when converted into recognizable and sortable objects and fields. [7] In simplified form, video analytics digitizes and thus allows each of the objects on the screen (people, cars, animals, bags, floppy hats, sneakers) to be separated out, categorized, isolated, and tracked across time and place. [8] With the click of a few buttons, police analysts can use computer vision to find all the white vans, red hats, and men carrying umbrellas (or other objects) and track those identified persons or things back in time across the cameras. [9] In addition, automated prompts can be programmed to identify objects (e.g., a gun or a backpack) or unusual patterns of activity (e.g., movement in an empty park at 2:00 AM). [10] Almost everything in the video streams is being identified and classified into objects or movements, giving police a visual superpower to process more data than ever before. [11]",

[15] There are also no federal or state laws which regulate video analytics in general, although some jurisdictions have responded to subtypes of video analytics like facial recognition and automated license plate readers (ALPRs).

For clarity, this discussion will focus on video analytics built into citywide Real-Time Crime Centers, although analytics technology can be used on video streams from police body cameras, private residential surveillance cameras, private commercial surveillance cameras, and university and secondary school cameras. [21] Video analytics as a hardware and software tool can be overlayed onto any digital video surveillance system. [22] For law enforcement purposes, video analytics is used in three main ways: (1) observational monitoring (virtual patrols); [23] (2) incident investigation (retrospective searches); [24] and (3) anomaly detection (unusual activity alerts). [25] In practical effect, once deployed, police can monitor the cameras in real time, query the database to review incidents, and respond to algorithmic alerts preprogrammed in the system.

The “traditional canon” of cases arose out of the analog surveillance realities of the 1960s through the 1990s and generally holds that people can expect little privacy in public spaces. [27] More recent cases address long-term digital tracking, leading myself and others to conceptualize a “digital is different” canon that creates tension with the more traditional cases.

This first step makes the convincing but limited claim that the question is still open for courts under existing Fourth Amendment doctrine, and the answer is certainly not compelled by precedent. The second step goes further, arguing that the Supreme Court’s recent cases on digital surveillance compel a finding that AI-assisted video analytics surveillance in Real-Time Crime Centers is a Fourth Amendment search. Specifically, I argue that the Supreme Court’s concern with long-term digital tracking through systems of mass surveillance in Carpenter v. United States [31] and United States v.

The two-dimensional image can be broken down into pixels with shadings representing the outline of the wood. The pixels are shaded in colors along a continuum of gray, with the darkest gray representing the door and the lighter colors representing the shadings of the white background. [48] A computer vision system will identify the contours of the door by the contrast between light and dark pixels. [49] The greater the contrast, the more likely it represents an edge. [50] The computer vision will see the outline of the door as a series of light and dark contrasts and find the rectangular edges accordingly. [51] To then find a match of the object, the algorithm will search for similar edges and contrasts in the dataset it was trained on to recognize objects we know as doors. [52] If we were talking about a brightly colored door, the system would break down the pixels into colors and, using the contrasts, identify basic colors. [53]",

[54] These images of doors will be labeled “door” [55] and the algorithm will be able to match a door by matching the edges of the pixels. [56] Using the language of AI, this process of taking labeled images and training them is called “supervised learning.” [57] More sophisticated AI models might rely on unsupervised learning, which means the computer teaches itself how to identify doors by scanning large datasets of images which include doors and things that are not doors. [58] Because the objects are not labeled, mistakes can occur (for example, the system might train itself to identify dark rectangles and not doors), but usually the system learns well enough to work, and humans laboring to correct the system are also a significant part of the labeling process. [59] Unsupervised learning is cheaper in terms of human effort than supervised learning because it avoids the need to label millions of objects for training sets. [60] Relatedly, if the only information you need is whether the door is opened or closed, a heuristic filter can be added that can show if there was movement of the pixels that corresponded to a rectangular shape opening or closing. [61] For a fixed security camera in a warehouse, the question of the door being opened or closed may be the only thing that matters (not the kind or color of the door). In addition, based on the success of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama2), innovators have begun creating similar models for object recognition using visual interference transformers.

[70] Of course, concerns exist about having sufficient diversity and representative images in a dataset. For example, early facial recognition systems were trained on datasets of mostly white men, creating identification errors when applied to the task of matching Black and Brown women (or really anyone who did not fit the training data). [71] Similarly, even labeling men, women, and children becomes fraught with choices that can distort the dataset; non-binary or non-conforming people might be excluded, and labeling age or gender identification can create unnecessary inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

In addition, the object (or objects) must be separated out from the background. If each video is broken up into frames, each frame must be further broken down into objects (and background, lighting, and other obstructions).

[75] More traditional optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms take characters as inputs and match the edges to identify the letters or numbers.

In recent years, other forms of face identification have emerged that look at skin textures, shadows, three-dimensional models, or some combination of all of these types.” [80] Once faces are turned into a digital faceprint (like a digital fingerprint), they can be matched to a database of stored digital faceprints. [81] Algorithms match the commonality of the probe photo to the database of photos and, as an output, produce a selection of close matches.

What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” [153] In other words, it might be reasonable to think that one’s phone call was not being listened to by police, but anyone (even police) could see someone using the phone with their own two eyes.",

Relatedly, the temporal aspect is less extensive, as the alert focuses on a particular time and does not include other information about other times. Finally, the preprogrammed nature of the suspicion seems less arbitrary and pervasive, as it has been preplanned and is essentially suspicionless.

United States , 476 U.S. 227 (1986), involving surveillance of an industrial plant for environmental protection investigation reasons. Id. at 229. In Dow Chemical , the Court allowed for powerful camera surveillance. Id. at 239. Explaining its holding, the Court stated:It may well be, as the Government concedes, that surveillance of private property by using highly sophisticated surveillance equipment not generally available to the public, such as satellite technology, might be constitutionally proscribed absent a warrant. But the photographs here are not so revealing of intimate details as to raise constitutional concerns. Although they undoubtedly give EPA more detailed information than naked-eye views, they remain limited to an outline of the facility’s buildings and equipment. The mere fact that human vision is enhanced somewhat, at least to the degree here, does not give rise to constitutional problems. Id. at 228. This holding was limited in Kyllo . See Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (“While we upheld enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in Dow Chemical, we noted that we found ‘it important that this is not an area immediately adjacent to a private home, where privacy expectations are most heightened.’” (quoting Dow Chem.

It should be noted, however, that where the anticipatory warrant places a condition (other than the mere passage of time) upon its execution, the first of these determinations goes not merely to what will probably be found if the condition is met. (If that were the extent of the probability determination, an anticipatory warrant could be issued for every house in the country, authorizing search and seizure if contraband should be delivered—though for any single location there is no likelihood that contraband will be delivered.
