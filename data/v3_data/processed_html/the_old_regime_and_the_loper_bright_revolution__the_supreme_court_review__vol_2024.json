Department of Commerce , 1 companion cases presenting the same question: whether Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. 2 should be overruled. The Court said “yes,” and did overrule Chevron . 3 A number of popular articles and legal commentators immediately called the decision “revolutionary” 4 or, in a variant, the culmination of a “conservative counterrevolution” 5 against the administrative state. Others insisted that the central “grand narrative” of administrative law has now become, for better or for worse, the narrative propounded by libertarian and originalist critics of the administrative state. 6",

      "text": "The thesis runs this way. A commonplace of revolutions, and counterrevolutions, is that however dramatic they may be in the short run, in the long run they often produce less change than their proponents hope and their opponents fear. Sometimes revolutions or counterrevolutions even serve to cement into place, or indeed augment, the very structures and norms that the revolutionaries found most objectionable. Such a thesis was suggested as to the most dramatic upheaval of them all: the French Revolution of 1789. In The Ancien Régime and the French Revolution , 8 written in 1856 after a long series of revolutions and counterrevolutions of varying description, Alexis de Tocqueville argued not only that the Revolution was as much an outgrowth of earlier laws, institutions, and norms as a departure from them, but also that those laws, institutions and norms largely survived the Revolution; indeed, they were in a sense confirmed and strengthened by it, albeit clothed in new outward forms. For Tocqueville, the Revolution had “a first phase during which the French seemed to want to abolish everything from their past, and a second in which they would recover part of what they had left behind. Many of the laws and political traditions of the Ancien Régime suddenly disappeared in 1789 only to reappear a few years later, much as certain rivers plunge underground only to reemerge somewhat farther on, bringing the same waters to new shores.” 9",

(This point is equally relevant for those who describe Loper Bright as a counterrevolution against the administrative state; counterrevolutions also chronically promise more than they deliver, as the supporters of the Bourbon Restoration discovered after 1815.) There is a difference to be noted right away: In the case of Loper Bright , in contrast to the French Revolution, we do not yet have the advantage of time and hence of hindsight. We are still in the first of Tocqueville’s two phases, in which revolutionaries hope and believe that the old regime of absolutism can be entirely extirpated. For the Court’s radical critics of the administrative state, such as Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, we are in the bright dawn of the Year Zero, which is also (as the French revolutionaries themselves hoped) a restoration of the classical republic.",

      "text": "But it is already possible to see how Loper Bright both grew out of pre-existing legal doctrines, principles, and trends, and also to see how the chastening of the Loper Bright revolution could occur, leaving in place much of the old Chevron regime under different labels. Indeed, I will argue, the beginning of that process is already visible within the four corners of the majority opinion itself. Writing for the Court, its leading Girondin or moderate revolutionary, the Chief Justice, already attempts to temper the Loper Bright revolution, writing a roadmap for a broad recharacterization of “ Chevron deference” as “ Loper Bright delegation.” 10 In some potentially broad range of the cases that would previously have been covered by the Chevron doctrine, courts will now say that Congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated discretionary policymaking authority to the agencies. In this framework, much of the review of the outer bounds of agency discretion that previously took place under the Chevron label will take place under the label of arbitrary-and-capricious review, but it is at best unclear how much will change in any operative sense, especially given that Chevron and arbitrariness review have long been held to overlap in part. 11 Furthermore, even apart from delegation, the Chief Justice’s opinion for the Court leaves in place a robust Skidmore doctrine of “respect” for persuasive agency interpretations; 12 it also backhandedly confirms the idea associated with NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc. that courts owe agencies a form of deference as to “mixed questions,” or the application of legal standards to facts, which is a form of policymaking discretion. 13 It is difficult, at least in the abstract, to identify with certainty any clear category of cases that will come out differently under the new regime than under the old one.",

Benson . 14 Loper Bright ostentatiously gives to the Court’s Hamburgerians 15 with one hand while partly taking back the gift with the other. Loper Bright , in other words, gives a highly salient (apparent) victory to the forces of libertarian administrative law, 16 while also and simultaneously qualifying that victory to such a degree as to raise serious questions about not only how much the law will change, but whether it will significantly change at all. In part, this curious two-step appears to be an effort on the part of the Chief Justice to both satisfy and yet also preempt the more radical originalist Justices to his right, the Jacobins de droite , Justices Gorsuch and Thomas. The latter would go even farther and eliminate some of the exceptions and qualifications the Court’s opinion leaves in place, or indeed would even revive the constitutional nondelegation doctrine as a tool for the more systematic destruction of the administrative state. 17",

Even a revival of the constitutional nondelegation doctrine, however, promises more than it could deliver, as I will explain. In the long run, by far the best prediction is that, just as the basic structures of the ancien régime survived the Revolution and were even further cemented into place, so too with the administrative state and judicial deference to administrative interpretations of law—whether that deference is explicit or implicit and whether under the label of deference, of delegated policymaking discretion, or of mere respect.",

Part II lays out the main holdings of Loper Bright , details the thesis that the decision may change much less than might initially appear, and examines some of the many doctrinal questions raised and left open by the decision. In particular, I examine the possibility of interaction effects with the Court’s other recent decisions on administrative law, and I suggest that those effects will not do much to exacerbate the effect of Loper Bright , in part because they cut in countervailing directions. Part III examines the main proposal of the Court’s Jacobins de droite , who would revive the nondelegation doctrine as a constitutional matter, and argues that such a revival is both unlikely to occur and likely to be surprisingly inconsequential even if it does occur. I conclude that the anti-administrative revolution, dramatic though it may appear to those of us who are living through it, is likely to be at most a marginal revolution—a mild and perhaps temporary correction to the “market” for administrative authority. Just as the French State after the Revolution emerged, in a sense, even more like itself, just under different forms and labels, so too with the administrative state after Loper Bright .",

      "text": "The Court’s historical narrative was simple. Federal courts had always asserted ultimate authority to interpret statues, de novo or independently. True, in some case law, including some very early case law from the Marshall Court—presumably at least probative evidence of the original understanding—the Justices had said that longstanding statutory constructions by the executive departments are worthy of “respect.” But the Loper Bright Court saw this as merely a form of what today would be called Skidmore deference, more accurately called Skidmore “weight.” 18 So too, the cases that spoke of deference in the 1940s, and that formed the immediate background in place when the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) was enacted in 1946, were merely cases in which courts deferred to the application of legal standards to facts, an exercise not of legal interpretation but of policymaking. The text of the APA, on the Court’s view, then plainly confirmed the (putatively) traditional position that federal courts are to decide “all relevant questions of law” for themselves. 19 In 1984, Chevron broke with the traditional view, creating a category of cases in which law-interpreting power was transferred from the courts to agencies, in violation of the APA. Over time, the Chevron framework became ever more complex, indeed byzantine, and eventually became so unworkable as to teeter on the brink of collapse. In this narrative, the overruling of Chevron was not so much a forward-looking change in the Court’s approach to deference as a restoration of the original authority of courts, traditional in our constitutional order and confirmed by the text of the APA. Like the Parisian revolutionaries of 1789, the more articulate of whom saw themselves as (or at least claimed to be) restorers of classical republican liberty, the Court’s narrative claims that it is merely restoring a fundamental principle governing the relationship between courts and agencies, one that is reflected in the APA’s text.",

Indeed, ironically enough, it is also a decent short summary of one of the main holdings of Loper Bright itself, which at least to some large degree recreates the Chevron framework while claiming to overrule it, as I will suggest shortly. The truth is that there have always been multiple strands jostling in the Court’s case law, 24 and these multiple strands reappeared within the Chevron framework itself. The opinion in Loper Bright elides this messy history in order to portray Chevron as a kind of fall from grace, an inexplicable departure from an original and longstanding baseline approach of de novo judicial interpretation in search of the single right answer.",

Here, it suffices merely to point out that Loper Bright ’s emphasis on delegation is not some sudden about-face by the Court.

The majority opinion in Mead once again put delegation front and center in Chevron analysis, 29 holding that a tariff classification ruling had no claim to Chevron deference because there was “no indication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry the force of law….” 30 Mead ’s basic rationale was that the Chevron inquiry should be refocused on delegation. Adumbrating the passage from Chevron quoted above, the Mead Court expanded upon the theme of implied delegation, saying: Congress … may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still be apparent from the agency’s generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which “Congress did not actually have an intent” as to a particular result. 31 Implied delegations, in other words, could be indirectly inferred as a legal presumption, regardless of any inquiry into the actual intentions of actually existing legislators—inferred from what the Mead Court called “indicator[s] of delegation.” 32 For the Mead Court, Chevron “was simply a case recognizing that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a particularly insistent call for deference.” 33 Therefore, “ Chevron left Skidmore intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent to delegate general authority to make rules with force of law….” 34",

Congress has often enacted such statutes. For example, some statutes expressly delegate to an agency the authority to give meaning to a particular term. Others empower an agency to prescribe rules to fill up the details of a statutory scheme, or to regulate subject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that leaves agencies with flexibility, such as “appropriate” or “reasonable.” When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional delegations, “fix[ing] the boundaries of [the] delegated authority,” H. Monaghan, Marbury and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L.

When judges identify the “best reading” of the statute, that best reading might itself just be that an explicit or implicit congressional delegation of such authority to the agency has occurred. The consequence of all this is that some large but uncertain fraction of what used to be called “ Chevron deference” can now be relabeled “ Loper Bright delegation.” Cases that used to be labeled as “deference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes” will now be called “independent judicial interpretation that identifies a single best answer, an answer that consists of a delegation of discretionary authority to agencies within a given range.”",

At most, the Loper Bright majority and dissent disagree over whether agency authorization to fill in gaps and ambiguities should be understood as a general guiding presumption, or instead as a case-by-case conclusion. 47 But as general presumptions have always had to be applied at retail in cases, it’s hard to see that the wholesale-to-retail transition will make any major difference, legally or substantively.

Consider the power to “fill up the details” of a statutory scheme, a power that in any given case might be discerned not from express delegation, but simply from Congress’s leaving essential details incompletely specified. The whole thrust of the Court’s approach in Loper Bright is that the court is to identify the best reading, all things considered, and that holds whether the relevant delegation is express or implied.

Of course it is true that, we may confidently expect, at least some cases will come out differently than under the Chevron regime.

And as we have seen, there is much more continuity across the triptych of Chevron , Mead , and Loper Bright than initially appears. Delegation is a central concept in all three, and all three acknowledge that—within whatever fairly loose boundaries the constitutional nondelegation doctrine allows—Congress may “delegate” or grant to agencies a legal space within which to create binding rules, whether through rulemaking or adjudication. The task of the judge, in all three decisions, is to determine the outer boundaries of the relevant delegations.

(In the loophole passage on delegation that I have quoted from the majority opinion, the majority included references to some famous cases of arbitrariness review, doubtless due to this conceptualization of discretionary-choice-within-a-reasonable-range as “policymaking.”) But of course, as many pointed out under the Chevron regime, 58 the authorized agency choice of a specifying or concretizing interpretation within a reasonable range is itself always also policymaking within a “policy space.” It is conceptually impossible for agencies to “choose policy” within a defined legal space granted by statute without first interpreting the statute to determine what the boundaries of the legal space are. Such choice by agencies is therefore both interpretation and policymaking, one hundred percent the one and one hundred percent the other, in a kind of hypostatic union of the administrative state. The Court’s relabeling of agency interpretation as agency policymaking is but a corollary of the Court’s more fundamental relabeling of Chevron deference as Loper Bright delegation.

EPA portends a general revival of “hard look” review, pervasively skeptical of the reasoning behind agency action, then it will magnify the effect of Loper Bright in the sense that claims that used to be decided at Chevron Step Two will now be channeled into arbitrariness review, which will also be heavy-handed.

As-applied challenges raised as a defense in an agency enforcement proceeding were always exempt from the six-year statute of limitations under the predominant law in the lower courts (which the Court seemingly endorsed). 73 So as to those challenges, nothing has changed—although the Court noted that unregulated plaintiffs, harmed by the combination of the agency action and the action of directly regulated intermediaries, would not be able to raise their challenges as defenses in enforcement proceedings.

The decision has a signaling effect that is not easy to capture in articulated legal doctrine, but that also radiates beyond the official doctrine.

The Chief Justice is nothing if not institutionally sensitive, and he is surely aware that a regime of genuinely de novo interpretation, without Loper Bright ’s major qualifications and especially its large loophole for delegation, is potentially a recipe for disaster. The Court spent much of the past Term overturning decisions from overly aggressive lower appellate courts, most conspicuously the Fifth Circuit. 96 In that world, the combination of an apparent headline victory for legal conservative-libertarians with a relabeling that preserves much of the institutional substance of the Chevron regime seems an ideal recipe for a Tocquevillian pseudo-revolution. Most courts, including most of the Supreme Court majority, do not want to be in the position of deciding for themselves what counts as, for example, an “unreasonable risk of toxicity.” Only time will tell which of these forces will predominate, but it would be foolish to bet that the operative landscape of judicial review of agency action will look markedly different in 2044 than it did in 1984.",

Although both joined the majority opinion, both also filed lengthy separate concurrences that laid out a more ambitious vision: a revival of the so-called “nondelegation doctrine” at the constitutional level. 97 From one standpoint, Justices Gorsuch and Thomas are asking exactly the right question, whatever the validity of the answers they give. As I have argued, the basic legal situation identified by Justice Scalia as the main engine of Chevron deference, now largely relabeled as “ Loper Bright delegation,” is that Congress has granted an indefinite range of broad and open-ended authorizations to the agencies. In that world, no adjustment of the doctrine concerning judicial review of agency statutory interpretations is likely to seriously curtail agency discretion, for the simple reason that judges know how little they know, and—under whatever doctrinal label—will flinch from the task of genuinely independent review.

Rather they are the product of a sustained course of action by Congress, as an institution extended over time, to build the administrative state. The fundamental logic of the nondelegation argument—that Congress must itself specify substantive policy because of the unique deliberative and democratic features of the lawmaking process laid out in Article I—is self-defeating; the same logic implies that Congress will, deliberating democratically, decide to grant statutory authority to the agencies when the public interest will be best served by doing so. 99",

Su , 106 the Court recently denied a petition for certiorari from a Sixth Circuit decision that upheld against a nondelegation challenge a central provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s power to enact and enforce any workplace safety standard that it deems “reasonably necessary or appropriate.” That issue had sparked much excitable academic discussion, 107 and it typifies the sort of broad open-ended authority that will make Loper Bright delegation operationally similar to Chevron deference. 108 The only Justices to dissent from that denial were Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, who seem unable to spark much interest among their colleagues for their project of mounting a heroic défense de la république . In general, the major questions doctrine, which Gorsuch (but not Justice Barrett) sees as implementing the nondelegation doctrine as a subconstitutional matter, has become a kind of substitute for enforcement of nondelegation at the constitutional level.",

What if anything would change? Probably not much. That dissent proposed a nominal narrowing of the constitutional test. Rejecting the “intelligible principle” formulation, Gorsuch would have limited the valid categories of delegated statutory authority to (1) executive fact-finding and application of law to fact; (2) “fill[ing] up the details” of statutory schemes in which the basic policy choices have been made by Congress; and (3) assignment to the executive or judicial branches of “certain non-legislative responsibilities.” 110 The problem with this approach is that it is unclear how much ice would really be cut by eliminating the “intelligible principle” test. Most or all of the broad and open-ended grants of statutory authority to which Justice Scalia adverted could be said, with a straight face at least, to fall into one or the other, or a combination, of Justice Gorsuch’s categories of valid delegation. Were the Court to formally abandon the “intelligible principle” test, one might well see one or two dramatic headline invalidations of federal statutes, followed by a relapse towards the status quo ante. An analogy here is to the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence, in which the dramatic revival of judicial limits in United States v.

It is very much an open question in the short run whether the moderates will succeed in arresting the course of the revolution, taking it so far and no farther. One recalls that the original Girondins ended up beneath the blade. But Tocqueville’s whole point, his striking thesis, is that whether or not the moderate revolutionaries succeed or, as in his case, fail, nonetheless in the longer run the Revolution merely served to reinforce and consolidate the order against which it rebelled. The laws and customs of the ancien régime were reintroduced in new forms and under new labels.

See Consumers’ Rsch. v. FCC, 109 F.4th 743 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc), cert. granted , No. 24-354, 2024 WL 4864036 (U.S. Nov. 22, 2024). It is noteworthy, however, that we do not see the opposite and more telling case of the Court granting cert in a case in which the lower court denied a nondelegation claim. The latter, unlike the former, would suggest a real appetite for a change in the law.",
