      "text": "This Note analyzes the recent trend of criminalizing homelessness in the United States. The first half discusses homelessness through the lens of American exceptionalism as a comparative tool. Comparing America to its international peers helps us better understand why America’s response to homelessness has become increasingly punitive. In doing so, the Note makes a novel contribution to American exceptionalism literature in applying the concept to homelessness. Specifically, it shows that while American homelessness rates are not unusually high, American shelter rates are unusually low relative to other western democracies. The Note shows this by combining national homelessness reports into a single dataset and document. The second half of the Note discusses current constitutional doctrine relating to homelessness, focusing onCity of Grants Pass v. Johnson. This section uses the first half’s analysis to show why, contrary to the Supreme Court’s decision, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling was, at its core, correct on a legal and sociological level in applying status crimes doctrine to homelessness. In doing so, the Note builds on others’ defenses of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling by both adding to those legal arguments and bolstering them with a sociological grounding, offering a new way of thinking about status crimes in general and homelessness in particular. The Note mounts a defense not only of now-outdated homelessness constitutional doctrine, but also of a shift in American political culture that recognizes homelessness as a product of social circumstances rather than individual failure. Such a change is a necessary prerequisite for curbing, on legal and political levels, America’s intensifying trend of criminalizing homelessness, the first step in bringing America in line with its peers and actually solving homelessness.",

Before any prosecution could take place, however, Debra Blake died. Little is publicly known about her death. She was sixty-two.",

      "text": "This Note takes a relatively unique approach to the study of homelessness law and doctrine. That is, it does not take law as an isolated field that can (or should) be studied on its own, or with a mere dash of policy analysis thrown in at the end. Rather, it sees law as embedded in and determined by social context. Such a strategy, according to some, has been described as “the single most revolutionary development in modern legal thought.”This is not to say that all legal research must consider law this way. Rather, it is to say that doing so isusefulandworthwhile, one of many forms that legal analysis and thought can take. Thus, while not all analysis in this Note isdirectlylegal, the consequences of the ideology and governmental policies outlined in this Notearedirectly legal, manifesting in municipal decisions to criminalize homelessness and court decisions responding thereto. In addition to the strictly legal arguments made below, another contribution of this Note is an analysis ofwhat motivatesrecent American legal trends. Such an analysis is imperative not only for understanding and evaluating current trends, but also for analyzing the root causes and offering solutions in domains that extend outside of law yet influence law, such as notions about what has to change in popular American political ideology. When legal arguments go hand-in-hand with political arguments, since law is always bound up with politics,they become all the more potent. As such, this Note takes an approach that is interdisciplinary and necessarily so.",

The analogous proportion in most other western democracies was far lower.

Unsurprisingly, many Americans tested in these studies showdecreasedempathetic neural activity when viewing people of different racial groups.This was true, for instance, when twenty-eight participants were shown scenes depicting individuals of varying racial groups in painful or neutral situations.Upon viewing these images, people who shared a social-racial identity with the person in need exhibited a higher level of empathetic neural activity than they did with those who did not share their ethnic group.This was despite the fact that many people would not likely claim they have explicit racial bias, since the social consequences of having such a bias are negative.Other studies involving mirror-neuron systems, which are responsible for unconsciously mirroring other individuals, show a similar level of racial bias.Thus, there are empathy gaps across racial lines.",

The answer is probably intuitive: in a majority white countrywith politics dominated by white individuals and interests,a problem that largely affects nonwhite people is likely to be neglected. The fact that most homeless people are mostly not white means that our political system is less likely to respond urgently to the problem. It is a classic case of structural racism. This was true, for instance, of the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, wherein the government responded slower than it could have, an action which many people attributed to the fact that the people most in need were disproportionately Black.Moreover, in the man-made disaster of the Flint, Michigan water crisis of 2014, the largely Black population of Flint likely suffered more intensely and received a less urgent response from the state due to the demographic of who was suffering.In each of these catastrophes, it is likely that the empathy deficits that white officials and members of the public exhibited towards the Black victims contributed to the lackadaisical response by government actors. The same can likely be said for homelessness. If homeless people were not members of an oppressed group, it is likely that there would be a more urgent government response to their plight.",

How does the attribution of individual responsibility to those in poverty (a view that is popular in America and described above) intersect with the government’s general unwillingness to provide shelter to homeless people given the racial lens with which we are operating? Armour’s book has even more answers here. In it, he uses the work of Fritz Heider to show how people ascribe moral blame to individuals.Specifically, when judging others, people who attribute one’s actions to their social circumstances areless likelyto morally blame them for those actions than when they see those actions as stemming from an inner psychology.When people focus on the situations in which others find themselves, they are less likely to morally blame those others for their bad acts. Applying this to the criminal sphere, a study done by Birt Duncan found that “violent acts tended to be attributed to internal causes when the harm-doer was black, but to situational causes when the harm-doer was white.”Other studies have verified these findings.",

Racism, individual and structural, is therefore not only responsible for Black people disproportionatelybecominghomeless, but also for theirremaininghomeless. The unwillingness to build homeless shelters and the tendency to blame people for the economic circumstances, which is exacerbated by the history of racial oppression and division in the United States, makes America’s response to homelessness much more understandable (though not justifiable).

In doing so, California was enforcing a “statute which makes the ‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense.”Rather than criminalizing an action, the status of being addicted to an illegal narcotic was criminalized. The Court likened addiction to a chronic disease, one over which the defendant had little to no control.The Court reasoned that “in the light of contemporary human knowledge, a law which made a criminal offense of such a disease would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.”This ruling established what became popularly known as the Eighth Amendment’s ban on “status crimes.”",

If the number of homeless people in a municipality “far exceed[ed]” the number of shelter beds available at any given time, the municipality will have violated the homeless individuals’ Eighth Amendment rights by enforcing a statute that criminalizes an integral aspect of their status as homeless people.Although this specific ruling was later vacated on technical grounds, its logic and holdings were reincorporated into law for the Ninth Circuit in 2019, inMartin v.

While the Ninth Circuit’s ruling was imperfect in that it did not explicitly guarantee minimum requirements of safety and standards for homeless shelters,it acknowledged that homelessness is a “status” akin to drug addiction—one that is dependent on social circumstances and not controllable predominantly by the individual. Thus, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling already contains in it the ideological shift required by the rest of the country for combatting homelessness. But absent a larger, popular recognition of the principle, our law is unlikely to reflect such a principle.",

      "text": "The Supreme Court decision reversing the Ninth Circuit’s ruling inJohnsonis the culmination of long-standing trends of the individualization of societal problems. While America’s homelessness rate is not particularly high relative to other western democracies, its rate of unsheltered homeless people is. This is explained by America’s comparative unwillingness to spend as much as other western democracies on its social safety net. But it is also more fundamentally the product of broadly and deeply held beliefs about the root causes of poverty and homelessness as problems of individual rather than societal failure, beliefs that are exacerbated by structural racism.",

      "text": "The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of the Constitution’s status crime doctrine makes sense in this light, since it accurately and shrewdly closed a loophole that governments could use to circumvent status crime doctrine. Nonetheless, the Court reversed the ruling and allowed municipalities to criminalize homelessness. The Court’s ruling effectively legitimized the view that homelessness is an individual “failing” like murder and allowed cities to criminalize people like Debra Blake. This Note has argued not only that such a ruling is misguided, but also that it rests on a fundamentally flawed view of how individuals and society interact. America’s legal approach to homelessness must see it as a social problem rather than a problem arising from a set of atomized individuals. The Supreme Court, however, has taken the opposite view. Seen through the lens of American exceptionalism, it is an exceptionally American response to further allow the criminalization of homelessness.",

However, despite a history of racial oppression, the reason homeless people receive more humane treatment in the U.K. and other countries is because, in the view of this Note and at least in part, there are simply fewer minorities in those countries. Thus, because the median homeless person is white in many other western democracies, the image conjured by the government and public of a homeless person is more likely to align with the group of the ethnic majority in that country.",

Because, as shown above, shelter availability is much higher in Europe, these laws have a far less deleterious effect on homeless people than similar policies do in the US.

After a social science study, popularly known as the “Baldus Study,” showed that people who were convicted of murdering white people were much more likely to be sentenced to death than individuals convicted of killing Black people, the Court upheld Georgia’s practice. They did so in part because, despite the clear evidence showing racial disparities, the same logic could be applied to the entirety of the criminal justice system, since racial disparities appear in every aspect of the criminal system, from arrests to convictions to sentencing. This is what inspired Justice Brennan’s remark that the majority feared “too much justice.”",
