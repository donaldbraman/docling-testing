      "text": "Ever since genealogical DNA unmasked the Golden State Killer in 2018, the use of this new forensic science has been ubiquitous. Police have solved several hundred cold cases by uploading unidentified crime scene DNA samples to consumer genealogical databases and, with expert assistance, building out family trees from the resulting matches to identify suspects. This practice has raised significant concerns among privacy scholars due to the intimate nature of DNA information and the lack of consent by the parties ultimately identified through their relatives’ choice to upload data. Critics argue that the Fourth Amendment bars law enforcement from running warrantless familial DNA searches using consumer databases, even among users who have given their consent. Several states have also passed legislation banning or severely restricting such searches.",

      "text": "This Article argues that the current debate around familial DNA has neglected the due process rights of another person: the innocent third party who is potentially convicted in the absence of accurate, exculpatory DNA evidence. Both the Compulsory Process and Due Process Clauses give a defendant the right to obtain exculpatory evidence in their defense through judicial subpoena and from the government itself underBradydoctrine. In close cases, the respective scopes of competing constitutional rights should be defined so as to not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Article argues against any ban on, or categorical constitutional or statutory rule requiring, probable cause for law enforcement to conduct familial DNA searches. The privacy interests raised by critics are legitimate; yet the functional inability for law enforcement to identify unknown suspects due to the lack of probable cause disproportionately burdens defendants whose Compulsory Process and Due Process rights are already limited by existing materiality requirements and inadequate resources. For many innocent defendants, the State itself is the best and only source of investigative resources and potentially exonerating evidence.",

At the start of the DTC revolution, users were not necessarily aware that law enforcement might be able to access their DNA profiles.In the current moment, even the most law-enforcement-friendly DTC companies explicitly allow users to “opt in” or “opt out” of sharing their information with police.Even so, many argue that such consent should not include third-party relatives eventually identified through genetic genealogy because these relatives have no control over whether their family members have uploaded their own DNA to a DTC site.As states have begun to regulate in this area, many have explicitly allowed for police access to DTC sites.However, several states have passed statutes restricting law enforcement use of familial DNA. The District of Columbia and Maryland wholly ban familial DNA searches of police databases; in Maryland’s case, the ban extends even to searches by private citizens (and, thus, criminal defendants).Montana, meanwhile, prohibits police from conducting familial DNA analysis using either DTC or police DNA databases without probable cause, which may be very difficult to establish in many cases involving an unidentified sample.",

While critics on both sides tend to balance the privacy rights of targeted parties against the crime-solving interests of the government, the constitutional framework is more complicated than this given the due process rights of these potential defendants. In Part One, this Article explains the science of forensic DNA generally, familial DNA specifically, and their roles in investigations and exonerations. Part Two presents the Fourth Amendment background to this problem and summarizes the argument that courts should recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy that would prohibit warrantless familial DNA searches, even where DTC users give consent. Part Two also asserts that while this argument is colorable, it is weak. This is due to both standing problems and the fact that the privacy interest in not being identified as the specific depositor of a single DNA sample is not comparable to the interest in the privacy of one’s daily movements.",

This Part argues both that defendants themselves should not be legally barred from running familial DNA searches in public or private databases and that the practical realization of their due process rights requires that law enforcement not be so barred either. Part Four concludes that, in close cases, competing constitutional rights must not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Part argues against any categorical rule substantially preventing law enforcement from conducting familial DNA searches. While legislatures are well-advised to limit the use of this technology to serious cases in which other investigative techniques have failed, they should not adopt bans or probable cause requirements; if they do, they should at least create an explicit process for defense subpoenas.

California, which dealt with the search of a suspect’s cell phone incident to arrest.The Court concluded that “[c]ell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee’s person,” due to the wealth of sensitive information they contain about a person’s browsing history, location, relationships, and so forth.It thus held that, absent an emergency, police require a warrant to search the contents of a phone otherwise properly seized incident to arrest.",

IfOsbornestands for anything, it is the proposition that “[f]ederal courts should not presume that state criminal procedures will be inadequate to deal with technological change.”The Court made it quite clear that “the development of rules and procedures” in the area of DNA science should be left in the “hands of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a focused manner.”A convicted prisoner might try to argue that a state statute effectively barring law enforcement from even attempting to re-open a case through familial DNA searches renders its procedures “fundamentally inadequate” underOsborneto vindicate their right to state-created post-conviction process.However, given the Court’s strong deference to legislatures, this argument is unlikely to prevail. It should be noted from this discussion of post-conviction process, however, that the lack of a constitutional innocence claim and the inapplicability ofBradypost-conviction emphasize the importance of accuracy in initial criminal adjudications.",

It agreed with commentators who argue that DNA contains intimate information, and the consent of an actual database user is not logically equivalent to the consent of that user’s relatives who may be identified through a familial search. Nonetheless, Part Two concluded that the argument that such searches require a warrant afterCarpenteris fairly weak. In the first place, the specific privacy interest recognized byCarpenterin the totality of one’s movements implicates detailed information about one’s actual life. By contrast, with the proper limitations on use, a DNA match reveals only one significant piece of information: that a subject left a particular sample in a particular place. More importantly, no authority recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy in someone else’s bodily materials. Familial DNA works because a subject has left their own sample at a crime scene, and the police match it to the profile of a physical sample offered voluntarily by a relative. A suspect does not have a right to bar their spouse from allowing the police to take a sperm sample from their own body after marital intimacy in order to compare it to the sample in a rape kit. In the case of consumer databases, the suspect’s connection to the consenting party is even more attenuated and less voluntary. Thus, the idea that the Fourth Amendment allows them to override the third party’s use of their own body sample might be somewhat more colorable, but it is still, ultimately, weak.",

Part Three of this Article argued that a criminal defendant has a colorable due process right not to have consumer DNA evidence rendered effectively unattainable by law enforcement. First, any statute preventing criminal defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to subpoena that information would raise compulsory process issues. Even if legislatures or courts only barred law enforcement from conducting such searches, the defendant’s access to the subpoena power is heavily limited in many jurisdictions by the materiality and favorability requirements, and any useful hits resulting from such a search would in any case require expensive forensic testing to lead to a specific subject. Thus, the reality is that a defendant is usually only going to access important exculpatory evidence throughBrady,which would put familial DNA largely out of reach if the police were precluded from conducting searches at all or only with probable cause. In any given case, this problem is also compounded by limited options post-conviction, at which point the Supreme Court has held thatBradydoes not apply and no independent right to DNA testing exists. Law enforcement’s ability to access the most accurate evidence on the front end affects a defendant’s right to obtain the most important kind of exculpatory evidence underBrady.",

Should courts recognize, or legislatures adopt, a Fourth Amendment rule that keeps familial DNA away from law enforcement absent probable cause, such defendants would be effectively shut off from the most accurate and valuable evidence at all stages of the criminal process. Like the Fourth Amendment argument, this Sixth Amendment argument is also somewhat weak since most courts do not even recognize aBradyright to law enforcement searches of public databases. Nonetheless, because a categorical ban on warrantless searches would essentially render all familial DNA evidence inaccessible, it would inherently block a defendant’s access to exculpatory evidence.",

Rather, there are two potential defendants’ liberty interests at stake—one of whom is most likely innocent. Constitutional rights necessarily have limits when they impact other parties’ constitutional rights; scholars debate whether these constitute limits on the scope of rights or simply their realization.Many nations’ constitutions have general limitation clauses, which set out the specific conditions under which constitutional rights can be limited.However, the United States does not have a general limitation clause and defines certain rights without any limitation.Courts have treated some rights as having implicit limitations, such as when they engage in interest balancing to determine “unreasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment. For other situations, the Supreme Court has adopted its own, much criticized tiered system of scrutiny.Sometimes, though inconsistently, courts limit constitutional rights through recourse to some version of John Stuart Mill’s harm principle, which holds that the only acceptable limitation on liberty is when it is necessary to prevent harm to others.",

Stein,the Second Circuit found a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel where a Department of Justice charging policy caused a private employer to terminate attorneys’ fees that they would otherwise have paid for according to the terms of their employees’ contracts.While the employees did not have a Sixth Amendment right to employer-funded legal counsel—in the same way that a suspect may not have a right for the police to conduct a familial DNA search—it nonetheless constituted an interference with the employees’ exercise of their Sixth Amendment right to mount a defense with their own assets that could not be justified by the state interest in encouraging cooperation by the corporate defendant.",

California, which excluded evidence found after law enforcement pumped a suspect’s stomach against his will and without judicial authorization.In an opinion by Justice Frankfurter, the Court held that the stomach pumping—while producing accurate evidence—violated due process because it “shock[ed] the conscience.”The Fourth and Fifth Amendment exclusionary rules in general represent the primacy of fair play over accuracy since they necessarily better protect the procedural rights of the guilty than they do the innocent.

High-profile cases like the Golden State Killer have increased public awareness of this science, and exonerations like Christopher Tapp’s, which was widely covered in true crime media, have created demand for it as a means of recourse for the wrongfully accused and convicted.",

Should courts consider Fourth Amendment claims challenging familial DNA evidence, they should bear in mind these other defendants when determining whether such searches are reasonable without a warrant. Furthermore, should states seek to regulate law enforcement use of DNA via statute, they should not adopt restrictions as broad as Montana’s. Ideally, even if states do restrict law enforcement access, they should at least create a formal subpoena process to clarify how criminal defendants can access this evidence. However, given the limitations on defense testing resources, this mechanism would likely benefit only a minority of defendants and should be supplemented by some degree of law enforcement access.",

      "text": "This Article focuses its analysis on familial searches of DTC databases in which the original user has affirmatively consented to law enforcement searches. A situation with no such consent would give the initial user a potential Fourth Amendment claim after Carpenter’s weakening of the third-party doctrine, though, as this Section will argue, an indirectly identified family member should lack standing to raise it. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 91 (1998) (holding that third parties lack standing to challenge the constitutional violations of others). A situation without such explicit consent but where a website’s Terms of Service stipulated that information was subject to search by law enforcement raises a separate question. After Carpenter, it is, again, unclear that the third-party doctrine alone would automatically bar such a claim based merely on use of the database, though the Terms of Service would be relevant to the question of whether the user had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information they shared there. Many courts have held that agreeing to a website’s terms of service constitutes a full-blown waiver of Fourth Amendment rights against government searches. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dunkins, 229 A.3d 622, 629–30 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2020), allocatur granted, 237 A.3d 415 (Pa. 2020) (per curiam). As Orin Kerr argues, however, such decisions are problematic because Terms of Service can define relationships only between private parties, not between a private party and the government.

The trial court had held that the issue of voluntariness had already been litigated during the defendant’s failed motion to suppress the confession. Id. at 686. While explicitly withholding comment on the strengths or merits of the defendant’s proffered testimony, the Court found that the defendant’s constitutional right to test the prosecution’s case at trial “would be an empty one if the State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” Id. at 690. In holding that the testimony should have been admitted, the Court emphasized its “relevance” to the defense and the lack of a “rational justification” for its exclusion. Id. at 689, 691. Third, and finally, in Rock v. Arkansas the Court held that the Arkansas Supreme Court violated the defendant’s compulsory process rights by ruling that hypnotically refreshed testimony was per se inadmissible. Rock, 483 U.S. at 62. It held that the court’s per se ruling was “arbitrary” and “disproportionate” to the purposes it was designed to serve (in this case, ensuring the reliability of evidence). Id. at 55–56. The Court directed that “[i]n applying its evidentiary rules a State must evaluate whether the interests served by a rule justify the limitation imposed on the defendant’s constitutional right to testify.” Id. at 56.",

Sept. 7, 2019) (rejecting as immaterial the defendant’s Brady claim based on an undisclosed CODIS hit to a third-party in addition to the hit to the defendant, because (1) the jury was told that 2.3 out of every 1,000 males would not be ruled out by the test, (2) that indeed there had been a hit in this case to yet another third-party they did hear about, and (3) because the evidence connecting other CODIS hits to the crime was weak in comparison to the extensive evidence against the defendant); State v. Knight, 245 N.E.3d 859, 879–80 (Ohio Ct.

Comm’r of Corr., 274 A.3d 237, 256 (Conn.

The U.S. Supreme Court has found limitations to individual rights in cases involving deference to military-decision-making due to the need for national security. See, e.g., Thomasson v. Perry, 80 F.3d 915, 926 (4th Cir. 1996). In cases involving parental decision-making, despite the Supreme Court recognizing a liberty interest in child rearing under the Fourteenth Amendment, where minor and parental interests have conflicted, the winner has been the minor, with the “scope of the state’s interest serving as the deciding factor.” Courtney Vorwald, When Parental and Minors’ Rights Conflict: Minors’ Constitutional Rights & Gay-Straight Alliances, 13 J. Gender, Race & Just. 465, 476 (2010) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400 (1923) (holding that the right to raise and educate children is a liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment) and Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 88 (2000) (Stevens J., dissenting) (stating that parental rights “have thus never been regarded as absolute” due to the state’s parens patriae interest). During the Prohibition era the Supreme Court even narrowed the scope of the Fourth Amendment in order to facilitate enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. See Daniel Yeager, A History of the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree (1916–1942), 67 How. L.J. 51, 72–73 (2023). For an argument that U.S. courts should, as in other countries, recognize that two conflicting rights co-exist and allow the democratic political process to mediate them see, Jamal Greene, How Rights Went Wrong: Why Our Obsession with Rights Is Tearing America Apart 114–39, 248 (2021).",
