      "text": "Silicon Valley–style technological innovation is ill-suited to address complex problems like financial inclusion and concentrated market power, yet promises abound that “fintech” can fix them. This oversimplified reduction of complex structural problems into technological puzzles has been critiqued as “techno-solutionism,” and it poses real dangers for public policy. When we start with the tech industry’s favored tools and then ask how to solve complex problems using those tools—rather than starting by defining the problem to be solved—it can distract policymakers from supporting real, structural solutions. Techno-solutionism can also deter policymakers from interrogating the limitations, and regulating the harms, of the proffered technological solutions.",

It makes several contributions: First, this Article introduces into the financial regulation literature theories of how the law can perpetuate, and then be stymied by, techno-solutionism. Second, it comprehensively calls out the techno-solutionism inherent in many fintech offerings (particularly crypto), laying bare their harms and demonstrating where they are unable to solve the problems they claim to address. Such harmful nonsolutions do not warrant accommodative regulatory treatment—and yet, some policymakers have sought to give fintech products just that. This Article’s third contribution is a detailed exploration of techno-solutionism’s impact on U.S. financial regulatory policy as it pertains to fintech. This Article also uses this lens to consider how techno-solutionism might impact the regulation of AI in financial services.",

      "text": "Technology has been an integral part of finance for a long time, but the rise of “fintech” has placed Silicon Valley–style technological innovation front and center in financial services. New technologies and technology-based business models have been developed as putative solutions to the limitations of the financial system, but fintech often fails to address the problems it claims to solve. Instead, fintech tends to create new problems that remain unaddressed because of misguided assumptions that technology can fix any problem—including the ones it causes. This “mistaken belief that we can make great progress on alleviating complex dilemmas, if not remedy them entirely, by reducing their core issues to simpler engineering problems” has been dubbed “techno-solutionism.”It is predicated on a reductionist worldview that sees complex problems flattened into engineering puzzles and neglects their multifaceted history and context.",

While there may be promise in some fintech business models, this Article explains why fintech’s ability to solve long-standing, complex problems is often oversold. This Article also explores how techno-solutionist fintech hype can distract from more meaningful solutions to long-standing problems and obscure fintech’s harms.",

In this regard, fintech solutions are emblematic of a broader techno-solutionist Silicon Valley worldview that disregards context—as Silicon Valley historian Margaret O’Mara describes it, “Why care about history when you were building the future?”Unfortunately, despite the flimsiness of many fintech promises—and despite the harms that many fintech business models have inflicted on the public—techno-solutionist rhetoric about fintech’s potential has been stubbornly resilient. This rhetoric sets the scene for a “wait-and-see” legal environment designed to allow these technological solutions to flourish without regulatory intervention. This Article argues that such accommodative inaction is unacceptable, given how damaging financial harms (to individuals, and to the broader economy) can be, but unfortunately lawmakers and financial regulators have been encouraged to internalize a techno-solutionist perspective by the fintech businesses and venture capitalists who will profit from such accommodative legal treatment.",

Sometimes—whether through the expressive value of their words or the more concrete impacts of their action or inaction—lawmakers and financial regulators perpetuate the very techno-solutionism that will ultimately undermine their ability to protect the public from harm. If financial regulators are convinced or forced to get out of the way so that technological innovation can go ahead and fix things, then that will create a conducive environment for the fintech industry and its funders to arbitrage regulatory requirements and perhaps even harden that arbitrage into durable legal permissions (a strategy known as “regulatory entrepreneurship”).To illustrate these dynamics, this Article will examine examples of legislative proposals and administrative actions that highlight where techno-solutionism seems to be driving policy around fintech, as well as examples of pushback against techno-solutionism.

More subtly, technologies that overpromise but are incomplete solutions to complex structural problems can also be distractions, alleviating political pressure for solutions to the non-technological dimensions of problems.As tech ethicist Elizabeth Renieris has put it, “Our imaginations and resources are once again diverted from fixing or rehabilitating what exists”: when the technological solution is pitched as so exceptional, the slow plodding changes of structural reform seem less worthy by comparison.This dynamic is sometimes evident, for example, in policy debates about climate change, where the promise of new technologies has sometimes undercut support for policies to reduce emissions.",

It isn’t criminal. It has no motive. It’s not looking to make more money. It just balances accounts,”and “technology is universalist.

Law educates the public about what is socially harmful.”While the expressive function of the law is most often discussed in terms of what it prohibits, permissive laws may also change public attitudes about what shouldnotbe considered socially harmful—and change behavior accordingly.The literature on expressive laws focuses on the law’s ability to standardize norms,and the law can perform a particularly potent standardizing function at a time when a technologically-enabled practice is new and the public is looking for guidance as to what to think about that practice.As a result, laws and rules that emphasize the benefits of a technology and related business models and deprioritize their harms can have a normative consequence in addition to their direct impact, lending legitimacy and encouraging adoption.

As we will discuss shortly, increased efficiencies can also increase the susceptibility of the financial system to financial crises, with all the human misery those crises entail.Concerns about efficiency-induced fragility have been percolating since highly efficient but brittle supply chains stalled and crumbled during the Covid-19 pandemic. People are now asking whether we have gone too far in maximizing supply chain efficiency, at the expense of overall resilience and robustness.We should ask the same question of technological innovations that are promising to make finance more efficient: What are they doing to the resilience of our financial system? To put the question a little differently, are increases in efficiency delivering diminishing marginal returns that are not commensurate with the increased fragilities they create?",

If AI does indeed end up eliminating lots of jobs, we will need policy solutions that take into account the dignity of work as well as people’s need for income.Worldcoin, however, offers (at best) an oversimplified solution to such a complex problem—a potential method for paying people to watch their screens once they no longer have jobs.

This Article has already explored why finance is an arena in which the potential harms are too significant for unfettered technological experimentation.Finance might also be different in another respect: the potential benefits of technological innovation may prove to be structurally limited in finance. Often, with technology, it is the users who unlock truly unexpected innovative use cases through their experimentation.In the financial industry, though, much of the innovation that has occurred has been driven by the supply-side, rather than consumer demand.It may be that where money is at stake, industry (including the crypto industry, which tends towards economic centralization)will afford users limited ability to actively construct how they receive their financial services.
