      "text": "The Supreme Court has increasingly embraced legal doctrines that empower elected officials to hide politically inconvenient information and ideas from the American people. Two lines of precedent illuminate this phenomenon and its reach across seemingly disparate areas of the case law. The first is a development in First Amendment law known as government speech doctrine and the closely related rule that public employees receive no First Amendment protection for their work product speech—that is, for anything that they write or say while doing their jobs. This precedent puts at risk the ability of public employees or publicly subsidized experts—ranging from auditors hired to ferret out agency misconduct to scientists commissioned to study and report on changing climate patterns—to convey truthful information and competent, good faith analyses consistent with disciplinary and professional norms. The second line of precedent is the aspect of separation of powers law known as unitary executive theory (“UE theory,” “UE,” or “unity”). UE proponents argue that the president must fully control all discretionary executive activity in the United States, at minimum through an unfettered removal power. This jeopardizes the independence of federal actors who are charged with research and reporting on matters ranging from public corruption to public health.",

Proponents of government speech doctrine emphasize that the people can respond to government speech at the ballot box, rewarding elected officials for speech that they like or punishing them when they dislike what they hear. As for UE theory, supporters emphasize that the president is the only elected official in the federal executive branch. Indeed, they describe the president as more politically accountable than anyone else holding elected office in the United States, as the president alone is subject to nationwide election. It is crucial, they argue, that the president alone exercises discretionary executive power so that the people know whom to blame or reward electorally for the use of such power. Similarly, they brush away concerns about presidential abuses by stressing the ability of the people to punish transgressions at the ballot box.",

To the contrary, UE theory was shaped and heavily promoted by the modern conservative legal movement well before the Roberts Court embraced it. Indeed, even as the Supreme Court rejected UE theory in the 1988 case ofMorrison v. Olson, the Justice Department under Attorney General Meese relied on it internally and championed it externally along with the then-nascent Federalist Society. Today, with the support of the Supreme Court, and with Donald Trump retaking the presidency and characterizing career experts across government as parts of a rogue “deep state,” UE theory and its accountability rationale have more influence than ever.",

Such gripes are not intrinsically partisan, but they can be marshalled in a partisan fashion when framed as appeals to stop “wrongheaded” or “offensive” views from being supported by public funds. Over the past several years, we have indeed seen campaigns, in both legal and political realms, for elected officials to control the communicative output of a range of government programs. These campaigns often characterize civil servants as parts of a leftist deep state, echoing the rhetoric of unitary executive theorists. Their targets include elementary school teachers, college professors, and librarians whom they deem “woke” and indoctrinating. The major thread of argument in these political and legal attacks has been accountability—specifically, the notion that the electorate, through elected representatives, should get the final word on the content of publicly funded knowledge production. Framed in legal terms, the argument is that all such output is the government’s own speech.",

Rather, holding officials accountable entails countless acts over time, ranging from legislative oversight to internal and external whistleblowing to fearless investigative journalism. All of these acts—including, but not limited to, voting—require the gathering and exchange of information and ideas. In the longer-term, they require a knowledge ecosystem that reliably produces such communications and supports a citizenry capable of assessing them.

If, on the other hand, the expression’s government source is obscured . . . then political accountability provides no meaningful safeguard.”Although the Supreme Court has said that it might weigh public perception among other factors to determine whether speech is private or public,the Court has developed no “reliable method” to gauge it.To make matters worse, the other factors that the Court considers—such as the extent of government control over speech—can themselves undermine accountability if they are not accompanied by authorship transparency.",

This is true, for example, of unity proponents’ over-reading of founding-era arguments linking constitutional and statutory provisions to accountability. Proponents tend to leap from highly case-specific founding era arguments to a broad, acontextual constitutional unity directive, a move enabled by their fixation on formal, rather than substantive accountability.This phenomenon is illustrated by unity proponents’ use of the founding era decision not to append an advisory council to the president.

I observe that Donald Trump has picked up this mantle in more recent years, including through his resistance to oversight by Inspectors General. In Section III.B, I look at the impact of both unity and government speech doctrine on the civil service more broadly. In Section III.B.1, I discuss the relationship between the federal civil service and UE theory. I focus especially on “Schedule F,” newly reinstated through executive order on the first day of the second Trump Administration and aimed at replacing vast swaths of the civil service with political appointees. In Section III.B.2, I summarize two key reasons, includingGarcetti’s impact, for the enervated state of first amendment protections for federal civil servants. In Section III.B.3, I cite several examples—including a recent spate of state laws regulating the classroom speech of public school teachers and professors—of government speech doctrine’s effect on state and local employees.",

Olsonitself involved a challenge to the independent counsel provisions of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Enacted in the wake of Watergate, the Act was an effort to confront public corruption, in part by creating an independent counsel (“IC”) with some degree of distance from presidential control. The Act’s IC provisions were responsive to fears that presidents would, as Richard Nixon had done, interfere with Justice Department investigations in which they could be implicated. Olson challenged these provisions partly on the basis that the IC was incompatible with a unitary executive because the IC did not serve at the president’s pleasure. Instead, the IC could be terminated only by the Attorney General (“AG”), who herself is subject to at-will dismissal by the president. The AG could fire the IC “only for good cause, physical or mental disability . . . or any other condition that substantially impairs [the IC’s] performance of . . . [their] duties.”",

To the majority, written by Justice Rehnquist, the judicial mission was limited and functional: its role was not “to define rigid categories”but to ensure that legislation does not “interfere impermissibly with [the president’s] constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”Among the factors that Rehnquist cited to explain why the removal restriction passed this practical assessment, it “was essential, in the view of Congress, to establish the necessary independence of the office,” an office that could be tasked with investigating the president or close advisors.To Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter, the president possessed all the executive power—a conclusion that he reached by interpreting Article II’s opening words, “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States,” to mean “all ofthe executive power”—and such power necessarily entails complete and indefeasible removal authority.As for the risk that the president might abuse this power, Justice Scalia answered that “the primary check against prosecutorial abuse is a political one. The prosecutors who exercise this awesome discretion are selected and can be removed by a President, whom the people have trusted enough to elect.”Justice Scalia’s vision of accountability was so narrow that he treated the IC provisions, enacted by elected members of Congress and subject to presidential veto, as constitutionally intolerable because they might subject the president and their advisers to popular scrutiny. The provisions, Scalia said, “weaken[] the Presidency by reducing the zeal of his staff” and “enfeeble[] him more directly in his constant confrontations with Congress, by eroding his public support.”",

To its reasoning about the limited scope of civil servants’ roles, the Court might add one about the work that they do perform. Namely, much of it entails the production of knowledge that reflects expertise and evidence-based analysis—for example, generating scientific reports or undertaking audits or inspections.
