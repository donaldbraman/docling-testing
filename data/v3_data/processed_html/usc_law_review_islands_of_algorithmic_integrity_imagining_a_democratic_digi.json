Prominent examples include Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X (which had formerly been known as Twitter). While only eighteen percent of Americans cited social media platforms as their preferred source of news in 2024, this number had risen by a striking six points since 2023.These platforms also compete in “one of the most concentrated markets in the United States,”as a consequence of network effects and high barriers to entry.Current trends suggest that social media will soon outpace traditional news websites as the main source for a plurality of Americans’ understanding of what happens in the world.Such platforms, which I will call “social platforms” here, are thus in practice a central plank of the political public sphere given their growing role in supplying so many people with news.",

I take up three common lines of criticism and concern here. A first line of critique focuses on these platforms’ alleged harmful effects on a broad set of user beliefs and dispositions thought to be needful for democratic life. Social platforms, it is said, pull apart the electorate by feeding them fake news, fostering filter bubbles, and foreclosing dialogue—to the point where democratic dysfunction drives the nation toward a violent precipice. This first argument concerns platforms’ effects on the public at large.",

It does not lean, that is, on any empirical evidence as to how users are changed by their engagement. Rather, it is a moral argument that picks out objectionable features of the relationship between platforms and their users. This plainly asymmetrical arrangement, it is said, allows invidious manipulation, exploitation, or even a species of domination. Even if users’ behaviors do not change, these characteristics of the platform-user relationship are said to be insalubrious. Especially given the role that algorithmic design plays in shaping users’ online experiences, it is argued, a morally problematic imbalance emerges between ordinary people and the companies that manage social platforms. In the limited case, in which there are few potential sources of information and in which those sources are controlled and even manipulated by their owners (usually men of a certain age who are disdainful of civility and truthfulness norms), an acute concern about domination arises.",

Such governance might be supplied by platforms’ own endogenous rules, which are usually embodied in their contractual terms of service or other internal procedures (such as mechanisms to dispute a take-down or deplatforming decision). Alternatively, governance could be supplied by exogenous legislation or regulation promulgated by a state. Private governance and legal regulation, of course, are potential substitutes. They can both be used to achieve the same policy goals. But how? What should such governance efforts, whether private or public, aspire to? And which policy levers are available to achieve it?",

There are many ways to craft the algorithms on which many platforms run.And there are many technical choices about which instruments to use, how to calibrate them, and what parameter (engagement? a subset of engagement?) to optimize. Many of these decision points offer opportunities for unavoidably normative choices about the purpose and intended effects of social platforms. Resolving those choices in turn requires some account of what it means exactly to talk about a normatively desirable social platform: That is, what should a social platform do? And for whom?",

This is a way of approaching the problem of institutional design, not a set of prescriptions for how to do such design. I do so by pointing to a model of a desirable platform, and then asking how we can move toward that aspiration, and how much movement might be impeded or even thwarted. My aspirational model is not conjured out of the ether; rather, I take inspiration from an idea found in the scholarly literatures in political science and sociology that evaluates pathways of economic development. The idea upon which I draw is that development policy should aim to seed “islands of integrity” into patrimonial or nepotistic state structures as a way of building foundations for a more robust—and hence public-regarding—state apparatus.This literature focuses on the question of the state’s seeds and nurtures zones (or those of another interested party, such as a private foundation or an international organization) where public-regarding norms, not self-regarding or selfish motives, dominate as a means of generating public goods.",

It draws on the “island of integrity” literature here as a general source for inspiration, instead of a source for models that can be directly transposed. I do not think that there is any mechanical way of taking the lessons of development studies and applying them to the quite different virtual environment of social platforms. To the extent lessons emerge, they are at a high level of abstraction. Still, studies of islands of bureaucratic integrity in the wild can nevertheless offer a useful set of analogies: they point toward the possibility of parallel formations in the online world. They also help us see that there are already significant web-based entities that exemplify certain ideals of algorithmic integrity in practice because they hew to the general lessons falling out of the islands of integrity literature.

That is, I help myself to the premise that reform of the digital public sphere can proceed first by the cultivation of small-scale sites of healthy democratic engagement and that these can be scaled up. But this assumption may not be feasible. It may instead be necessary to start with a “big bang”: a dramatic and comprehensive sweep of extant arrangements followed by a completely new architecture of digital space. If, for example, you thought that the problem of social platforms began and ended in their concentrated ownership in the hands of a few bad-spirited people, then the creation of new, more democratic platforms would not necessarily lead to a comprehensive solution. Given disagreement about the basic diagnosis of social platforms’ malady, it is hard to know which of these approaches is more sensible. Therefore, there is some value to exploring a piecemeal reform approach of the sort illuminated here.

Most common parameters quantify some element of users’ engagement with the platform, but they do so in different ways. Engagement measures are relevant from the platforms’ perspectives given their economic reliance on the revenue from advertising displayed to users.In theory, more engagement means more advertising revenue. But engagement on social platforms is surprisingly sparse.

In practice, they rest on some account of democracy as an attractive—even ideal—political order.

As a consequence of these dynamics, social platforms exercise a certain kind of unilateral power over the public. Such power might be especially worrying if it is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people—and if these people have close connections to those in high state office (with the Musk/Trump relationship offering an obvious, highly salient example). This slate of worries comes sharply into play whenever platforms comprise an important part of the democratic public sphere. Under these conditions, Benn and Lazar point out that platforms ought not to merely prevent negative consequences for democratic politics; they must also ensure “that content promotion is regulated by epistemic ideals.”This entails, in their view, a measure of “epistemic paternalism.”It rests on platforms’ unilateral, and effectively unconstrained, judgments about interface and algorithmic design.",

Even when an arbitrary legal relationship is exercised in a beneficent fashion with the interest of the weaker party in mind, Pettit suggests that there is a displacement of the subject’s “involvement, leaving [them] subject to relatively predictable and perhaps even beneficial forms of power that nevertheless ‘stifle’ and ‘stultify.’ ”",

As a very general first step, Luca Belli and Marlena Wisniak have proposed the use of “nutrition labels,” detailing key parameters of platform operation as a way of enabling better informed consumer choice between platforms.This kind of notice-based strategy, while plausible to implement, assumes a measure of user choice over which platform to use. At present, such choice is largely illusory because of the market dominance of a small number of platforms.It is also hard to see how consumers, particularly those already at the ideological margin, could be persuaded to make the right kind of choice. Inducing more competition, and hence more consumer choices, in social platforms would give notice-oriented measures more bite. Some work has been done on potential varieties of platform design,but there remains ample room for inquiry and improvement. The basic point, though, is that some combination of increased competition and better consumer-facing notices would better allow certain users to select among different social platforms based on their own preferences—although it is hard to be confident that the right users, so to speak, will be those aided.",

Increased disclosure by platforms on “whether . . . advertisements appear on misinformation outlets,” as well as increased “transparency for consumers about which companies advertise” there, provides the potential to stimulate a collective shift to a more truthful equilibrium.Such disclosures help ensure that “the means of ensuring legibility [will not completely] fade into the background of the ordinary patterns of our li[ves],”as platform affordances become too banal to notice.
