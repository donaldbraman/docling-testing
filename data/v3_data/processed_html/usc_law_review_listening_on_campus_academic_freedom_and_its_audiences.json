      "text": "Current debates about campus speech often conflate two related but importantly distinct values: free speech and academic freedom. Both are widely perceived to be in crisis,but they are not interchangeable, and slippage between the two makes it even harder to frame, let alone address, difficult questions about speech in university settings. Many of the most fundamental challenges—indeed, much of what makes campus speech unique in the first place—arise from the need to accommodate both values. In doing so, defenders of academic freedom must, as advocates of free speech have, more clearly articulate an account of listener interests. The basic project of this Article is to frame that challenge and take a few initial steps toward answering it.",

Their central complaint is that faculty, administrators, and students are selectively silencing speakers and ideas. The paradigmatic victims are often isolated conservative voices,faculty and speakers attacked for things they write or say,and students who find themselves inhibited from speaking their minds on campus.",

In that sense, they invoke free speech but are not actually rooted in the free speech tradition.Sometimes the motivation seems to be nakedly punitive or political—a thumb in the eye of a liberal professoriate—or to make martyrs of provocateurs who have no business speaking in an academic setting to begin with.",

Getting a handle on the campus speech debate therefore requires a clear account of listener interests, as this symposium invites. Doing so is especially important because many of the interventions flowing from the listener-based free speech critique are in tension with, and sometimes flagrantly undermine, the other essential element of campus speech: academic freedom. That freedom has many dimensions, each with its own value proposition: “freedom of research and publication, freedom in the classroom, freedom of intramural speech, and freedom of extramural speech.”For simplicity’s sake, I will call the expression associated with these freedoms “scholarly speech.”",

The free speech critique has a clear account of value and harm (one largely rooted in listener interests) and has the additional benefit of constitutional moorings that are more secure than those of academic freedom.By invoking the importance of students’ exposure to a broad marketplace of ideas—a distinctly free speech-based frame—would-be reformers have justified a broad range of interference with universities’ self-governance. The tension between those principles has asymmetrically favored free speech both rhetorically and conceptually. Defenders of academic freedom must respond with an account of its value—as something that not only protects scholars-as-speakers but ultimately and more importantly serves “the common good,”which can only happen if scholarly speech reaches the right audiences.",

Doing so is not only important as a matter of rhetorical strategy, but necessary for a full and accurate description of academic freedom’s value.

The underlying conception of freedom being threatened in this paradigm is roughly akin to the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment in the public sphere: a broadly libertarian marketplace of ideas in which expression must be “uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.”",

Universities are not necessarily set up in opposition to values of democratic participation and individual autonomy, and indeed might well further them,but their central mission is to generate and disseminate knowledge—to be “a space where ideas are held up to critical scrutiny and our best understanding of the truth is identified and professed.”As the Supreme Court put it inSweezy v. New Hampshire—a case often cited in the literatures involving both listener interests and campus speech—we “must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.”Keyishian v. Board of Regents, which likewise has a prominent place in both literatures, similarly declared that “[t]he classroom is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas.’ The Nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth ‘out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.’ ”",

It would not violate the First Amendment if a state university’s geology department were to deny tenure to a faculty member espousing such beliefs in her scholarship.

The prohibition on viewpoint discrimination is nearly ironclad in public discourse,but not in scholarly settings.How else to describe the situation of the geology professor, who after all is simply advocating a scholarly viewpoint? Or consider the fact that in public discourse, speaker equality is a fundamental principle.In a scholarly setting, ideas and speakers should not be disregarded simply because they are politically unpopular, but it does not follow that all must be accorded equal respect.Those that do not measure up to the relevant scholarly standards not only can but should be excluded, even if they must be accepted in public discourse.",

This is why universities’ academic freedom policies often appear alongside their tenure policies; the two are deeply intertwined. In the realm of academic discourse, the right to “speak freely” looks very different than it does in public discourse, and it is not true that all “dissenting voices must be tolerated rather than silenced”in all campus settings.

Broadly speaking, advocates of the free speech paradigm have consistently and effectively invoked listener interests to suggest that students are being deprived of important ideas and that they are being forced to listen to objectionable ones. The latter line has become particularly prominent in the wake of the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel, and has led to allegations of inconsistency and even hypocrisy on all sides.
