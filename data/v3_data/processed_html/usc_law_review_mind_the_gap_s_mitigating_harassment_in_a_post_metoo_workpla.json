      "text": "In a post-#MeToo workplace, harassment remains pervasive, and harassment law still fails to provide protection for the harms experienced by many workers—particularly those in the most vulnerable jobs. Even when reform efforts are introduced through legislation, courts, and agency guidance, it often does not provide greater power, autonomy, and dignity to women in ways that would more meaningfully protect them from workplace abuse. We are the first to create a database of state legislation, including over three thousand bills, that allows us to empirically analyze the extent to which lawmakers comprehensively address harassment following the rise of the #MeToo movement. We assess comprehensiveness by examining how responsive legislation is to existing gaps in legal protection during the five years following the 2017 tweet that took #MeToo activism global, relative to the 2016 baseline period. We found that states introduced a wide breadth of reforms to combat harassment and gender inequality, including some changes that address longstanding gaps in legal protection. Gaps persist, however, and in some cases worsened post #MeToo. Going forward, reform efforts by state legislatures—and all legal stakeholders—will prove most effective if they move away from narrow conceptions of sexual harassment and follow the voice of workers, pursuing a broad, multi-layered agenda around gender equity that is responsive to the realities of our evolving workplace and society. This is especially true in 2025 as the Trump administration redirects the EEOC’s resources towards attacking diversity, equity and inclusion measures.",

In 2018, the EEOC reported that sexual harassment charges were up nationwide—the first increase observed in a decade.In 2018, the EEOC received 7,609 sexual harassment charges compared with the 6,696 charges received in 2017.The EEOC recovered almost $104 million more for those with sexual harassment claims between 2018 and 2021 than between 2014 and 2017.The agency capitalized on #MeToo momentum by increasing lawsuits to enforce sexual harassment law and holding more employers accountable.",

This is not unlike the “Swiss Cheese Model” adapted for use to control the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Swiss Cheese Model of risk reduction, developed by James Reason in the 1990s, visually demonstrates how a variety of strategies and actors can work together to reduce risk of harm.In the context of harassment, no single intervention such as restricting NDAs or increasing training can prevent all harassment, but multiple interventions can make a lasting difference. This is particularly true when the approach aims to reduce gendered power dynamics that make harassment more likely.",

We also analyzed how timing, geography, and political factors shaped the legal activity following #MeToo, relative to the 2016 baseline period. Our dataset is defined broadly and includes all harassment-specific legislation, as well as legislation addressing other gender equity issues including: pay equity, expanded coverage under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), leave and accommodation, and occupational protections that address intersectional subordination.

Harassment law and gender-based reforms more broadly tend to follow a similar pattern of state-led rights protection and enhancement due to the gradual trend of federal courts contracting civil rights in the workplace among other venues. Federal lower courts, in particular, have increasingly issued employer-friendly Title VII and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) decisions that have been both formally and informally codified into law.Congressional gridlock has also led to a standstill with respect to anti-harassment legislation.Moreover, extreme partisanship in both Congress and the judiciary diminishes the likelihood of relying on Congress to act as a check when courts roll back rights, as they have in the past.Only six federal reforms related to harassment and workplace gender equity passed during the five years following #MeToo; of those, only two had system-wide effects: the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 and the Speak Out Act of 2022.

We argue that states must continue this momentum not only to mitigate harassment more broadly, but also to address intersectional issues of economic precarity and racism that make harassment more frequent and particularly harmful to low-wage workers, who are disproportionately women of color.For example, while women of color face higher rates of harassment due to compounding systems of subordination, most of the legislation proposed only strengthens protection for claims of sexual harassment or assault, and not intersectional subordination based on sex and race that is a common experience for women of color.As a result, those experiencing intersectional harassment or discrimination based on multiple protected characteristics, including race, ethnicity, or national origin, are left vulnerable.Legal remedies that fail to consider experiences unique to women of color or other groups with multiple marginalized identities will ultimately fail to root out discrimination and harassment for those individuals, leading to underenforcement.",

Arbitration can further inhibit access to justice because claimants then have difficulty finding a lawyer willing to file a claim in arbitration when the deck is so heavily stacked against them. Research shows women of color are more likely to be denied access to courts than White women, due to mandatory arbitration.This is because of the particular prevalence of these clauses in low-wage industries where women of color are overrepresented.Thus, low-wage workers, who are already uniquely vulnerable to workplace violations including harassment and retaliation, suffer the most from contracts restricting their ability to access a court of law.",

These empirical results suggest that while the #MeToo movement may have sustained some of its initial impact on harassment and gender equity reform over the past five years, progress may be stagnating. Avoiding further stagnation requires legal stakeholders to offer workers consistent harassment and gender equity reform that are responsive to the changing realities of the current workplace.

As a result, there will likely be an influx of the new plaintiffs who are able to have their day in state court. While this is generally good news, it also highlights the continuing and glaring failure of the judiciary to remedy the harassment that is experienced and brought before the courts. Expanding coverage to additional workers and increasing their access to the courts will only work if they are encountering a judiciary that is responsive to power hierarchies and realities of the workplace, while also being serious about curtailing harassment.

Others condoned behavior of a government official or stated policy support for an issue, without actually making changes that change circumstances for women on the ground. Many states also created task forces and commissions to study issues of harassment and gender equity, but subsequent legislation would be needed to effectuate any changes proposed by these groups.

While these bills can have substantive impact, research has shown that unless certain conditions—such as transformative leadership or bystander-specific training—are met, trainings are likely to be ineffective at promoting changes in workplace behavior. Moreover, training requirements can even be counterproductive. Legal stakeholders, thus, need to be aware of how training requirements tend to individuate harassment, making it about individual perpetrators rather than broader shifts in workplace culture, power dynamics, and worker dignity that are required. Training, grievance procedures, and investigations that focus on damage control may obscure the systemic patterns so often present in harassment and discrimination cases. In the current landscape, given the central role of theFaragher/Ellerthdefense, these employer practices and procedures do more to insulate the employer from liability than they do to mitigate workers’ risk of harassment or other gender-based harms.",

In addition to legislation strengthening anti-retaliation protections generally, more bills should focus on identifying and mandating what specific behaviors are considered retaliatory. These reforms could include retaliatory actions such as substantive changes to terms of employment, disclosing personnel files, contacting immigration authorities, or threatening to report an employee’s immigration status.Doing so would signal the legislature’s recognition that retaliation is rooted in systemic power imbalances and is particularly threatening for workers in low-wage industries or workers with intersectional identities including race and national origin.",
