In addition, a small but significant body of law also addresses the rights of listeners to obtain access to information and speech in the face of coercive state measures seeking to deprive them of that access. Finally, there is also a well-established “compelled speech doctrine,” which addresses the right of speakers to resist government compulsions to speak—i.e., a right not to speak. This paper considers a question heretofore largely ignored by the courts, which is whether the First Amendment also protects a right against compelled listening.",

The first would be a First Amendment right not to listen that operates against the state, restricting the state’s power to force an unwilling listener to hear the state’s chosen message. Such a rightmustexist if public discourse among citizens is to play its democracy-empowering role (and also must exist under autonomy-based theories of free speech, for obvious reasons).

In these situations, in short, the question is whether the state may or may not enforce a listener’s desire to be left alone. Furthermore, while disputes strictly between private speakers and listeners of course do not themselves trigger the First Amendment because of the state action doctrine, when the state steps in to resolve those disputes, the First Amendment is very much implicated. This paper’s ultimate goal is to identify the state’s proper and constitutional role in those situations.",

Indeed, the bulk of First Amendment doctrine, including the concept of unprotected categories of speechand the foundational distinction between content-based and content-neutral laws,all concern government suppression of speech or speakers (often, but not always, speech or speakers the state dislikes).",

The right to choose an audience is implicit in the Court’s standard test to evaluate content-neutral “time, place, or manner” regulations, which requires inter alia that any regulation “leave open ample alternative channels of communication.”If such “ample alternative channels” referred to the ability to speak toanyaudience, the test would have no teeth at all—and that is not the case, as illustrated by numerous cases.Furthermore, in the leading case dealing with expressive conduct, a topic closely related to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the second Justice Harlan also went out of his way to state that he would not uphold a regulation of conduct with an “incidental” impact on expression if the law “in practice has the effect of entirely preventing a ‘speaker’ from reaching a significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate.”",

After all, what exactly is the point of “speaking” if no one is listening?It is true that some people keep private diaries or talk to themselves aloud—what is called “intrapersonal communication.”But there are reasons to doubt whether such audience-less “expression” falls within the First Amendment;and in any event, it is certainly not the focus of most First Amendment jurisprudence or disputes. Normally, speech is meaningful, whether viewed from an instrumental or autonomy standpoint, if it has an audience. Admittedly, that audience need not be immediate or identifiable to the “speaker”; after all, we still read Shakespeare and Dickens. But reaching an audience is the point of communication. This is why in the area of expressive conduct, the Supreme Court has explicitly said that conduct is expressive—and so potentially protected by the First Amendment—only when “the likelihood was great that the message [intended to be communicated] would be understood by those who viewed it.”",

Unlike inVirginia Pharmacy, there is little doubt thatRed Lioninvolved willing speakers—in the shape of the broadcasters themselves (the plaintiff in the case was, in fact, a broadcaster)—who would communicate to listeners/viewers. But by failing to seriously analyze both listeners’andspeakers’ interests and incentives in assessing free speech issues, theRed LionCourt created a conundrum. The Fairness Doctrine may have, in theory, advanced broadcast audiences’ interest in receiving balanced coverage of public issues, but it also incentivized broadcasters to avoid taking strong editorial positions on public issues other than anodyne centrist ones. Moreover, it disincentivized coverage of public issues in favor of generic entertainment, in order to avoid the strictures of the Fairness Doctrine.But faced with this argument, the Court simply (and rather naively) deferred to the FCC’s views that the “possibility [of any such incentive effect] is at best speculative.”Yet less than two decades later the FCC itself, in the course of repealing the Fairness Doctrine, concluded that the doctrine did in fact create substantial “chilling effects” because “the fairness doctrine provides broadcasters with a powerful incentive not to air controversial issue programming.”Of course if this was true—as is likely—then without speakers, listeners during the Fairness Doctrine era were necessarily left (so to speak) in the dark regarding public policy controversies.

Moreover, the leading scholarly discussion of a putative right not to listen similarly adopts a unilateral rather than a relational approach.In that article, Caroline Mala Corbin makes a compelling case, based both on the autonomy interests of listeners,and on more instrumental concerns about democratic self-governance,for a First Amendment right not to listen, and I am happy in this article to accept and build upon that analysis.

In that situation, the Supreme Court, in cases such asCohenandSnyder, seems to assume that unless the speaker and speech are intruding into the home, a speaker’s interest in expounding her message to any and all must prevail over a listener’s desire tonotlisten, and to be left alone. But the Court gives no explanation in any of these cases for why this is so, other than generalized references to the need for robust public discourse. And because the Court has never addressed, much less recognized, a right not to listen outside the home, it does not seem to realize that the situation potentially poses a problem of competing constitutional interests, not just a speaker’s right prevailing over general societal interests. But in fact, for all the reasons already stated there are strong reasons to recognize constitutionally grounded listeners’ interests in such contexts, which makes some effort towards reconciliation necessary.",

It is this principle that led the Court to uphold a ban on targeted, residential picketing inFrisby v.

And certainly, the state has no interest in purging their speech from public debate, including in one-to-many speech in particular, simply because some members of the audience object to it.

And the Justices are, to reiterate, also clearly correct that speech cannot be expunged from public debate simply because it might offend or discomfit some who hear it. But by going further and suggesting, as Justice Scalia did inHilland all the Justices did inMcCullen, that the state has no interest in enforcinglisteners’ expressed preferences to be left alone, they are just wrong. The question of how a state might design a mechanism to enforce those expressed preferences has already been discussed; but for the purposes of this discussion the key point is that the Court appears in these cases to be conflating two entirely separate questions: the exclusion of offensive speech from public debate, which is impermissible, and the enforcement of listeners’ expressly invoked right to be left alone, which is not.",

NetChoice, LLC.The case involved challenges to two statutes, one enacted in Florida and the other in Texas, which both regulated the content moderation practices of social media platforms. In particular, the Florida law restricted the power of such platforms to moderate posts by “journalistic enterprise[s]” and posts by and about political candidates.The Texas law more broadly forbade platforms from moderating content based on the viewpoint expressed in a post or the viewpoint of the poster.Both laws also granted users certain procedural rights when their posts were moderated,but those aspects of the laws are less relevant to this article. The Supreme Court ultimately declined to resolve the claims because the plaintiffs had chosen to bring a facial, as opposed to as-applied, challenge, and both lower courts had failed to apply the proper standard for facial challenges.But in the course of providing instructions on remand, a solid majority of the Court made it clear that the First Amendment provided strong protections for platforms’ editorial choices in the form of content moderation.As such, the Court was quite clear that if platforms chose to bring as-applied challenges to the application of at least the Texas law to their moderated “feeds” or homepages, the challenges were very likely to succeed.",

The laws of both states are rooted in the basic assumption that legislators (and Governors) know best what content listeners/users should and should not be exposed to.

For that reason, if the United States or an individual state felt it necessary to restrict targeted advertising directed at minors, it would be much better to empower minors or their parents to opt out of all, or specific forms of, targeted advertising than to enact a flat ban as the DSA does. Admittedly, authorizing parents to restrict targeted advertising could also have deleterious effects on vulnerable youth (sometimes parents are the problem); but that is a difficulty that pervades our society and can only be addressed through broader legal reforms, particularly in family law.",

The first is a First Amendment right against the state, which generally would prohibit the state from forcing ideological content on unwilling listeners, a proposal that hopefully is not controversial. More difficult is a potential listener interest in avoiding speech from private speakers. Such an interest does not directly implicate the First Amendment, given the lack of state action; but in this paper I argue that nonetheless, the interest is a genuine one rooted in principles of free speech, which should be recognized: a right, as it were, to be left alone. The key implication of recognizing such a right is that it suggests that the First Amendment shouldnotbe understood to protect private speech directed at an unwilling listener who has invoked their right to be left alone, at least in a one-to-one situation. This in turn means that the First Amendment does not prohibit the state from adopting measures designed to enable unwilling listeners to invoke and legally enforce their right to be left alone, though nor does it mandate such measures.",

Here, too, one faces a potential conflict between two First Amendment interests when a listener desires some information or message but the speaker does not want to share it (perhaps the situation in theVirginia Pharmacylitigation). In this situation, as noted earlier, normally the government cannotforcespeakers to communicate because of the compelled speech doctrine. But as with a right to be left alone, it may well be that the government has a legitimate role in facilitating voluntary relationships between willing speakers and listeners, and in incentivizing reluctant speakers on behalf of listeners.
