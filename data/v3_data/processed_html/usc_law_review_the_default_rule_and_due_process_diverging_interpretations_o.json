In that same vein, the recognition and enforcement of international human rights law has grown in the last century, and as rules of international human rights law have become binding on the United States judiciary, courts are faced with new, conflicting demands of both extradition requests and international law-derived rights of relators (that is, the individuals whose extradition is requested by foreign countries).",

      "text": "In 2023, two federal circuit courts analyzed the phrase “the charging document” in two bilateral extradition treaties: the Fourth Circuit reviewed an extradition treaty between the United States and Lithuania, and the Ninth Circuit reviewed an extradition treaty between the United States and Peru. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits disagreed over how to approach the phrase and its effect on the extradition process. InManrique v. Kolc, the Ninth Circuit found “the charging document” requirement in the U.S.-Peru Extradition Treaty to be ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations. Utilizing court precedents on treaty interpretation, the Ninth Circuit deferred to the executive branch’s interpretation of the phrase. In doing so, the court found that Peru had provided the necessary documents to satisfy the “charging document” requirement. On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit found that the phrase was clear and unambiguous, holding inVitkus v. Blinkenthat the judiciary was compelled to decline Lithuania’s extradition request upon analyzing the “charging document” requirement in the U.S.-Lithuania Extradition Treaty. The Fourth Circuit found that the inclusion of “the charging document” in the U.S.-Lithuania treaty was a requirement that Lithuania had not satisfied when it had presented prosecutorial documents to the Secretary of State in an extradition request. The court rejected the Secretary of State’s argument as to the adequacy of Lithuania’s submitted documents.",

      "text": "The discrepancy between these two circuit courts illustrates how the judiciary’s deference to the executive branch (a deference codified by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century and referred to in this Note as the “default rule”) in matters of extradition treaty interpretation has manifested in the 2020s. At least twenty-eight extradition treaties that the United States has entered into with foreign nations reference the “charging document” in their lists of documents that a foreign nation is required to provide in an extradition request to the United States.As the judiciary will likely be called to interpret the “charging document” in future extradition requests, the judiciary’s decision to give deference to the executive branch in interpreting this phrase merits attention. The interpretation of the “charging document” requirement implicates due process concerns of relators, given that the charging document requirement ensures that the country requesting extradition complies with the procedure outlined in its treaty. This Note argues that courts, when faced with extradition requests from countries whose treaties include the “charging document” requirement, are bound by precedent to apply the default rule in a way that may conflict with a relator’s constitutional, due process rights. This Note also contends that this form of deferential interpretation to the executive branch may conflict with the fundamental right of due process afforded to relators by international law. However, departing from executive deference affects the United States’ foreign relations with other sovereign countries—this Note will briefly explore this ramification as well.",

      "text": "Part I of this Note provides an overview of how extradition treaties are utilized by the United States and how they are interpreted by both the executive and judicial branches. In brief, the statute governing extraditions in the United States bestows the judiciary with the responsibility of certifying an individual for extradition: the judiciary interprets the relevant extradition treaty to determine whether the person being sought by the requesting country may be certified as extraditable.Once the court certifies the extraditability of a relator, the Secretary of State has the discretion to either extradite the relator or deny the foreign country’s extradition request.Importantly, although extradition is neither a full trial nor a solely administrative function, relators are deemed to have certain constitutional rights when subject to extradition proceedings in the United States.However, the unique procedural characteristics of extradition do not align with notions of constitutionally mandated due process, as relators do not benefit from the constitutional protections that courts have recognized for criminal defendants.Judicial precedent also mandates that courts defer to the executive branch’s interpretation of extradition treaties.This deference has created friction between the judicial and executive branches, as the judiciary has been tasked with balancing relators’ due process rights against the executive branch’s foreign relations commitments to other sovereign nations. As the fundamental right to due process has been developed by international human rights bodies over the course of the 20th century, the judiciary’s deference to the executive branch has come into conflict with the advancement of due process as an international human right as well.",

This becomes especially important when questions regarding the foreign country’s political intentions for extraditing individuals are brought before the U.S. judiciary.",

In Toledo’s case, the court found that “the Treaty does not mention formal charges or theOrden de Enjuiciamientoanywhere. And the requirement of a ‘copy of the charging document’—which specifies no particular document—does not define the level of formality [they] should read into ‘charged with.’ ”The court found that such a reading would allow theAcusación Fiscalto be permitted as a “charging document” given that language elsewhere in the U.S.-Peru treaty equated “charged with” to “sought for prosecution,” and that the documents indicating an individual was “sought for prosecution” could encompass documents submitted before theOrden de Enjuiciamientoin Peruvian criminal proceedings—that is, theAcusación Fiscal—therefore satisfying the treaty’s requirements.",

The court inManrique v. Kolcconsidered the evidence provided by both the Peruvian prosecutors and the State Department to understand “the charging document” requirement in the Peru-United States Extradition Treaty, and in doing so, the court contextualized the requirements of the treaty.This analysis favored the Secretary of State’s interpretation—as noted previously, extradition proceedings are distinct from criminal trials, and the judiciary may be comfortable with some bias in a proceeding that does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.However, the court’s deference to the Secretary of State’s interpretation of the “charging document” could be read as the court’s inclination to uphold foreign relations with Peru at the potential expense of Toledo’s liberty rights. As the court acknowledged, the risk of misinterpreting the requirements of the treaty was great: Toledo would be sent to Peru to face trial and be imprisoned, and his ability to file a habeas petition would be nullified by his presence in the Peruvian criminal justice system.",

Blinkenimplicitly renounces the traditional application of the default rule: the Fourth Circuit alludes to the pressure the executive branch places on the judiciary to comply with the Secretary of States’s understanding of a provision of a treaty—especially when the judiciary finds that the provision in question is clear and unambiguous.In finding that “the charging document” mandate was clear and unambiguous in its requirement that a discrete document was to be produced by the Lithuanian government, the Fourth Circuit protected Vitkus from a questionable extradition request when it found that the treaty required that the requesting country produce a specific document charging him with a crime. By doing so, the Fourth Circuit found clarity in the procedural requirements established in the extradition treaty and potentially upheld Vitkus’s Fifth Amendment due process rights. However, it is important to note that should the majority of the Fourth Circuit have found that “the charging document” requirement was an ambiguous provision in the treaty, then there would have been a possibility that the court would have applied the default rule.",

Blinken, in which the court referenced two cases from the 19th and early 20th centuries to note that the extradition procedure did not require the formalities of other judicial proceedings.This case also underscores contemporary federal judiciary’s deference to understandings of international law codified before the duties of upholding international due process became binding on the American judiciary. Accordingly, although Vitkus might have been able to raise that the executive branch’s interpretation of “the charging document” would not be “fair,” it would be unlikely to be held as a viable argument against the certification of his extradition by the judiciary.",

Although, as stated in Part I of this Note, the judiciary has no authority to alter bilateral extradition treaties that the United States executes with foreign governments,Vitkus v. Blinkenexemplifies the kind of case that could incentivize the executive branch to negotiate extradition treaties that have specific language relevant to the parties’ criminal procedures. By doing so, the U.S. and a sovereign signatory to a bilateral extradition treaty could prevent interpretive friction in the United States judiciary and allow for more expeditious extradition processing. Specifying the documents that better ascertain the level of probable cause established in a foreign proceeding could not only protect relators from extradition that invades their constitutional and international human rights but also the judiciary from breaching rules of non-inquiry and incorrectly interpreting a foreign country’s criminal procedure.However, this would not be a salve to the protection of international human rights of relators: a country without an independent judiciary could likely still satisfy the document requirement even if it were specified, and the risk of violating a relators’ due process rights might still be an issue, albeit in a different form than the one at issue in this Note.",

Although Toledo raised the possibility of maltreatment and suffering while awaiting trial in a Peruvian prison, his argument failed to trigger a humanitarian concern by the court.Notably, courts in the United States may disavow the rule of non-inquiry should the relator raise the possibility of meeting human rights abuses by the requesting state in the event the extradition court certifies extradition—Toledo’s argument regarding his ill health does not align with the circumstances the court considers in extradition.On the other hand, Vitkus’s testimony about his arrest in Lithuania does support a contention that he could be tortured should the U.S. certify Lithuania’s extradition request, given that while applying for asylum, the “Board of Immigration Appeals (the ‘BIA’) found in 2014 that Vitkus’s ‘credible testimony established that he was beaten, burned, and nearly asphyxiated by [Lithuanian] police officers, who inquired into his contributions to a political party.”The findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals did not preclude the extradition court from certifying Vitkus for extradition.Vitkus’s torture in Lithuania—allegedly related to his political involvement in Lithuania with a political group called “the Russia party”—may have implicitly prompted the court to consider that the Lithuanian criminal proceedings would violate Vitkus’s human rights upon returning to Lithuania. This concern might have informed the Fourth Circuit’s view that “the charging document” requirement was a clear and unambiguous requirement that Lithuania provide a discrete charging document.",

Extradition treaties are entered into by the executive branch in its process of conducting foreign relations, creating international agreements regarding extradition unifies countries in a common, collaborative law enforcement apparatus.There are many reasons for entering into a collaborative law enforcement apparatus, including “ensuring that fugitive criminals do not go unpunished for their alleged crimes, discouraging crime throughout the world, and protecting nations from fugitive criminals by eliminating the possibility of safe havens for fugitive criminals.”Allowing countries to extradite individuals strengthens the relationship between the two countries, while not cooperating with an extradition request, especially when issues regarding erroneous treaty interpretation arise, hampers international relations between the countries.When considering the factors for staying a pending appeal (“(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; “and (4) where the public interest lies”),courts have noted that noncompliance with extradition requests diminishes the “force” of extradition treaties, and that “[i]f other countries lose confidence that the United States will abide by its treaties, the United States risks losing the ability to obtain the extraditions of people who commit crimes here and flee to other countries.”This may be the reason why the Secretary of State, who ultimately decides whether to proceed with an extradition request once the court certifies a relator for extradition, does not often refuse to surrender those sought by a foreign country for prosecution.",

II, § 2, cl. 2) did not include agreements made between the United States and Hong Kong, which is a non-sovereign state. Id. at 993–94.
