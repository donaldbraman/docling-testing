Yet scholars often assume that the Constitution has nothing to say about corporations. The doctrine of federal incorporation, meanwhile, is confused: courts analogize federal corporations to state corporations or federal agencies, despite obvious inconsistencies, or avoid them altogether. As this Article demonstrates, however, the Framers understood the power to charter corporations as an independent power with its own prerogatives and limits, and there was little doubt about the power’s constitutionality following ratification. In fact, as this Article shows, the Marshall Court constructed doctrine defining this preexisting power across three cases—Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,McCulloch v. Maryland, andOsborn v. Bank of the United States— establishing an independent threshold for the creation of federal corporations: “constitutional” purpose. Congress has effectively relied on this tacit, but independent, legal power for over two centuries.",

In addition, this Article makes two important interventions. First, by clarifying the legal basis of federal incorporation, the existence of the charter power may offer alternative rationales for the constitutionality of federal legislation, alternatives to existing constructions of administrative law, and a coherent way to analyze large transactions which currently defy categorization. Second, as the current Court considers whether to invalidate existing jurisprudence which endorses “implied” rights, the existence of the charter power cuts against the theoretical case for doing so. Challenging the presumption against the legitimacy of unenumerated powers and rights, the charter power demonstrates that, in at least one case, a “silent” power is concrete, constrained, and original.",

      "text": "To demonstrate the existence of the corporate power, this Article relies on several interpretive modes of argument.Part I, which is discussed further in the Introduction, describes the twentieth-century case law of federal incorporation. Proceeding chronologically, Part II builds on recent advances in historical research, showing how the corporate power was drafted into the Constitution and illuminating the early legal parameters of the corporate power. As Part II shows, contemporaneous legal sources and the transcripts of the Constitutional Convention make clear that the Framers understood federal incorporation as a distinct legal power. There was no confusion that the power to incorporate was part of another field of law.Further, the fact that the word “corporation” was left out of the Constitution did not mean that the power was legally absent. Scholars have sometimes taken this omission to signal that the possibility of a corporate power was rejected.But as the Framers discussed themselves, they had specific reasons to omit the word for this corporate power.At the time the Constitution was drafted, anti-monopoly sentiment was high.The political climate meant that including the word “corporation” in the Constitution posed nothing less than a threat to ratification.The Framers discussed drafting strategies which explicitly took into consideration that the corporate power could be drafted into the Constitution—and predictably relied upon as such—even if it was not expressly labeled by name.The early Congress passed federal incorporation laws by an overwhelming majority.And for years after ratification, the legal matter was uncontested: until James Madison raised political objections to the first bank bill and then again after that bill was passed, architects of government action relying on the corporate power did not appear to have thought it was necessary to engage in any sustained legal defense of their project.As Part II explains, these facts together indicate that, as a legal matter, the corporate power was in the Constitution from the beginning.",

Constitutional powers and rights generally have “paradigmatic” case law, or doctrinal foundations on which subsequent law is moored.Part III excavates this foundation for federal incorporation law.Scholars often readMcCulloch v. Marylandfor its holding that the Bank of the United States was constitutional. In doing so, they treatMcCullochas a singular case: the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States is a stand-alone issue—not about the legal form of federal incorporation which created the Bank, but about the Bank as asui generiscreation—and the constitutionality of the question ultimately turns on the Necessary and Proper Clause, more or less alone.",

More importantly, in constructing the corporate power, the Court was not inventing the law of federal incorporation or simply resolving the question of the Bank’s constitutionality. To the contrary, the Court was solving secondary problems related to the preexisting constitutional power of incorporation. Offering new readings ofMcCulloch v. Maryland,Dartmouth College v. Woodward, andOsborn v. Bank of the United States, this Article shows how these cases operated as a trinity in which the Marshall Court organized how the national government’s power to create corporations—generally, not just the Bank specifically—would operate in the new federal system.In addition to other relevant rules governing federal incorporation, the Marshall Court articulated an independent threshold for when federal corporations were proper: “constitutional” purpose.",

Part I shows why—despite the continuous reliance on the federal corporate form by Congress and the executive—existing legal understandings of that activity are inadequate. As Part I explains, the legal uncertainty that has defined federal incorporation in its modern form has, at times, made this device more valuable, not less. This Part shows how, as administrativeand private-law regimes grew increasingly organized and regulated in the twentieth century, the existence of a legal device which remained comparatively murky offered Congress and the executive branch valuable legal and financial flexibility. Not inconsequentially, this meant that a range of actors had little incentive to clarify this field of law.",

As Part I argues, the legal ambiguity around federal incorporation in the aggregate has come at a cost to constitutional coherence and legitimacy, outweighing the legal and financial flexibility that the uncertainty of the corporate power has sometimes enabled. Part I outlines those costs. First, the corporate power’s indeterminacy encourages large actors to use privatization or public backing to escape the constraints of either public or private law—encouraging financial boom-bust cycles and corroding public trust.Second, confusion about the status of federal incorporation may lead the current Court to mistake legitimate federal corporate activity for “illegitimate” administrative action as it continues to redefine various aspects of administrative law.Third, in the twenty-first century, Congress has increasingly engaged in large transactions, which are difficult to reconcile with and may disrupt existing fields of law, ranging from the 2008 financial bailout to the Puerto Rican debt crisis to the recent Oxycontin settlement.The lack of a legal category for understanding this activity arguably stems from—and might be alleviated by addressing—our failure to recognize the corporate power in the first instance.

Once we recognize that the corporate power is a stand-alone constitutional power, we can begin to describe its legal particulars, just like any other independent power or right. Federal corporations differ from state corporations and federal agencies in important ways. Among other things, federal corporations allow the federal government to craft a corporate form that includes the kind of substantive, not economic, rules that regulatory agencies are currently prohibited from imposing on state-chartered corporations.Federal corporations remain bespoke, are not governed by general incorporation laws, and support the production of goods and services—they are not just devices for federal spending.Along with Part I, Section IV.A helps to outline these activities and differences.",

As Part I details, the Court has signaled that it may revisit federal corporation law as part of its general reconsideration of administrative law.A clear understanding of federal incorporation may prove important if it does so, not least because federal corporate activity may intersect with the rapidly changing landscape of Appointments Clause jurisprudence.",

This tradition has venerable roots: among other sources, it sprang from the transformative mid-century First Amendment fundamentalism of Justice Black.But the corporate power demonstrates that textualism—and indeed, interpretation that, like Black’s, takes rights and powers seriously—must be distinguished from mere taxonomy to remain coherent. Specifically, this Article shows that the tradition of unenumerated interpretation which the corporate power demonstrates cuts against the presumption against unenumerated rights that the Court relied on, for example, inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.The corporate power also suggests that there is firmer existing interpretive ground for unenumerated law than we have previously considered possible. The drafting approaches of the Framers detailed here—what is usually referred to as the “structuralism” of the Marshall Court, and what we might term the “interprovision interpretation” of the Warren Court—indicate as much.This interpretive unity transcends disagreements about Federalist politics and the particular legal climate of the 1960s and deserves further attention on its own.",

Both approaches elide the law-politics distinction. Original meaning attempts to “democratize” originalism by assuming that there is no distinction between the two in a positive manner.Conversely, those favoring a realist approach—rightly refusing to ignore evidence of political disagreement in the past—often conclude from this disagreement that no clear legal meaning can be found.What is lost is the reality of historical friction between law and politics. This, in turn, endangers the possibility that accurate historical work might coexist with positive legal argument.The corporate power is evidence of the kind of collateral damage that can occur when we are limited to realist or originalist perspectives: if we fully commit to either at the expense of contradictory evidence, we would be unable to explain its presence.",

      "text": "“Constructions” or “conventions” refer to authoritative ideas and lenses which solve for constitutional confusion and may have become law-like over time. They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013).Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan & Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power).

      "text": "“Constructions” or “conventions” refer to authoritative ideas and lenses which solve for constitutional confusion and may have become law-like over time. They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013).Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan & Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power). See also Jonathan Gienapp, The Myth of the Constitutional Given: Enumeration and National Power at the Founding, 69 Am. U. L. Rev. F. 183, 193, 207 (2020) [hereinafter Gienapp, Myth] (arguing that the General Welfare Clause and the Preamble were meant to be active clauses as part of a “Wilsonian” understanding of the Constitution).",

[of] chartering corporations” on bases other than the Necessary and Proper Clause. Charles L. Black, Jr., Structure and Relationship in Constitutional Law 14 (1969). Recently, scholars have stated that the corporate power exists and is constitutional but have not developed the point further. See, e.g., Nikolas Bowie, Corporate Personhood v. Corporate Statehood, 132 Harv. L. Rev. 2009, 2015 (2019) (reviewing Adam Winkler, We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights (2018)) (“Even though the U.S. Constitution didn’t mention corporations, members of all three of the federal government’s branches considered the power of incorporation such an inherent feature of sovereignty that they authorized Congress to charter corporations as the Constitution’s first implied power.”); see also Jonathan Gienapp, The Lost Constitution: The Rise and Fall of James Wilson’s and Gouverneur Morris’s Constitutionalism at the Founding 46 n.146 (Mar. 4, 2020) [hereinafter Gienapp, Lost Constitution] (unpublished manuscript) (on file with author) (“The real question . . . was whether it was politically useful to reinforce the already vested [incorporation] power through enumeration or not.” (citation omitted)); Robert J. Kaczorowski, Inherent National Sovereignty Constitutionalism: An Original Understanding of the U.S. Constitution, 101 Minn. L. Rev. 699, 701–02, 706 (2016) (describing incorporation as “one of [Congress’s] inherent sovereign powers”—evidence of a broader theory of constitutional understanding he argues existed in the early republic called “inherent national sovereignty constitutionalism”—but leaving ambiguous the scope, nature, number, independence, or possible contemporary applications of the powers that flow from this theory). As I discuss in Part II, a broad “sovereignty” argument is, on its own, insufficient to clear the hurdle of proving federal incorporation’s status as an autonomous constitutional power, not least because sovereignty itself was transformed by the change from the British to the American Constitution. Along similar lines, as I explain in Part III, the power was not “vested,” in the sense that it simply continued unabated, but had to be constructed by the Marshall Court.

      "text": "“Constructions” or “conventions” refer to authoritative ideas and lenses which solve for constitutional confusion and may have become law-like over time. They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013). Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan & Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power).

Justice Black’s dissent was based on his opposition to the resurrection of the “ordered liberty” test that Dobbs relies on. Id. at 526 n.21 (“[C]ases applying specific Bill of Rights provisions to the States do not in my view stand for the proposition that this Court can rely on its own concept of ‘ordered liberty’ or ‘shocking the conscience’ or natural law to decide what laws it will permit state legislatures to enact.” (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963))). Justice Black’s worry about “ordered liberty” stemmed from not only his commitment to the hard-won First Amendment rights his fundamentalism protected, id. at 509 (“One of the most effective ways of diluting . . . a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning.”), but also the possibility that incorporation—extending federal constitutional rights to protect Americans against state overreach, which he supported—would be diluted if it were conflated with the “ordered liberty” test. Id. In short, he appears to have feared that Griswold ’s embrace of unenumerated rights would require legal logic that would, in turn, call into question the incorporation of First Amendment rights he had made his life’s work.",
