				<p>* J.D. Candidate 2025, Columbia Law School; Symposium &amp; Book Review Editor, <em>Columbia Law Review</em>. I am immensely grateful to my Symposium Committee—Chris Aranda, Susie Emerson, Abigail George, Aimee Grainer, Alexa Iraheta Sousa, Nikhil Mahadeva, Nicole Morote, Alice Park, Juan Ramon Riojas, and Charles Simonds. Without their tireless effort and dedication, hosting this conference and publishing this Issue would not have been possible. Many thanks also to Tashayla Borden, Isidora Echeverria, Saleema Ibrahim, Kevin McCarthy, Kristina Ohemeng, Destiny Spruill, and Nick Tabio for volunteering to help with the conference; to Inés Dubbels for invaluable assistance at every step of this process; to the editors of the <em>Columbia Law Review</em> for countless hours of work on this Issue; to Professor Rachel Moran for proposing this important and timely topic; and to Professors Jeremy Kessler, Richard Briffault, David Pozen, and Kendall Thomas for their feedback. I thank my friends and family—most especially my parents, Anita and Tipu, and my brothers, Rithik, Akshay, and Kavan—for their endless support and encouragement. Finally, thank you to every activist I have shared community with, worked alongside, and drawn inspiration from. One day the world we live in will look like the one we dream about.</p>

As Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia alumnus who was targeted and detained by federal immigra­tion officials for his participation in pro-Palestine protests, explains:<br />
If anything, my detention is a testament to the strength of the stu­dent movement in shifting public opinion toward Palestinian liberation. Stu­dents have long been at the forefront of change – leading the charge against the Vietnam war, standing on the frontlines of the civil rights movement, and driving the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Today, too, even if the public has yet to fully grasp it, it is students who steer us toward truth and justice.<br />

<p class="Document">Professors Grant Christensen, Elora Mukherjee, Karen J. Pita Loor, and Gali Racabi, as well as law student Kevin McCarthy, spoke together on the third panel, titled “Who Protests, and Where? Examining Protest Spaces.”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Each panelist offered their perspective on a particular type of protest or protester: Christensen discussed protests on indigenous reser­vations; McCarthy discussed protests by incarcerated individuals; Mukherjee discussed the unique considerations noncitizen protesters must face; Loor discussed racial justice protests and policing; and Racabi discussed labor strikes and workers as protesters. The panelists compared how protests in different spaces are regulated and examined what makes each type of protest more likely to shift public sentiment or secure insti­tu­tional concessions. Christensen’s Symposium piece, <i>The Right to Protest in Indian Country</i>, asserts that between the three potential sovereigns impli­cated by protests on indigenous lands—the tribe, the state govern­ment, and the federal government—tribal governments should be the sole regu­lator of these protests.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

Toussaint\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>Afrofuturism in Protest: Dissent and Revolution<\/i>, chronicles the his\u00adtory of Black protest movements in the United States from the colonial era to the twenty-first century and examines these movements\u2019 philosophical underpinnings.[footnote]Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1382\u201383.[\/footnote] He argues that the Black radical tradition reveals protest to be not just a right, but a moral impera\u00adtive, and illustrates how modern protest movements can draw inspiration from that tradition.[footnote]Id. at 1453\u201364.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Professors Grant Christensen, Elora Mukherjee, Karen J.

Examining Protest Spaces.\u201d[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] Each panelist offered their perspective on a particular type of protest or protester: Christensen discussed protests on indigenous reser\u00advations; McCarthy discussed protests by incarcerated individuals; Mukherjee discussed the unique considerations noncitizen protesters must face; Loor discussed racial justice protests and policing; and Racabi discussed labor strikes and workers as protesters. The panelists compared how protests in different spaces are regulated and examined what makes each type of protest more likely to shift public sentiment or secure insti\u00adtu\u00adtional concessions. Christensen\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>The Right to Protest in Indian Country<\/i>, asserts that between the three potential sovereigns impli\u00adcated by protests on indigenous lands\u2014the tribe, the state govern\u00adment, and the federal government\u2014tribal governments should be the sole regu\u00adlator of these protests.[footnote]See Grant Christensen, The Right to Protest in Indian Country, 125 Colum.

The day-long conference on November 15, 2024, featured four panels and was bookended by two keynote speakers.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] The event opened with a lecture from Professor Justin Hansford, who dis\u00adcussed his experience as a legal observer during the protests following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.[footnote]See id.

This panel addressed the Amendment\u2019s speech\u2013conduct distinction, hate speech, online content moderation, and the reg\u00adulation of public versus private universities. The pan\u00adelists also reacted[footnote]See Behind the Scenes, supra note 30 (\u201cThe panels not only offered dynamic conversations and Q&amp;As for an audience of students and academics, but also provided val\u00aduable feedback for the authors, whose pieces were still in the process of being edited.\u201d).[\/footnote] to Abu El-Haj\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>A Right of Peaceable Assembly<\/i>, in which she proposes an independent Assembly Clause doctrine, distinct from the existing free speech doctrine derived from the First Amendment\u2019s Speech Clause.[footnote]Tabatha Abu El-Haj, A Right of Peaceable Assembly, 125 Colum.

Harcourt, Karuna Mantena, Dylan C. Penningroth, and Etienne Toussaint discussed common trends in racial justice, gender equality, and anti-war movements, as well as the lessons that can be drawn from historical protest movements and the responses they encountered. Toussaint\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>Afrofuturism in Protest: Dissent and Revolution<\/i>, chronicles the his\u00adtory of Black protest movements in the United States from the colonial era to the twenty-first century and examines these movements\u2019 philosophical underpinnings.[footnote]Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1382\u201383.[\/footnote] He argues that the Black radical tradition reveals protest to be not just a right, but a moral impera\u00adtive, and illustrates how modern protest movements can draw inspiration from that tradition.[footnote]Id. at 1453\u201364.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Professors Grant Christensen, Elora Mukherjee, Karen J. Pita Loor, and Gali Racabi, as well as law student Kevin McCarthy, spoke together on the third panel, titled \u201cWho Protests, and Where? Examining Protest Spaces.\u201d[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] Each panelist offered their perspective on a particular type of protest or protester: Christensen discussed protests on indigenous reser\u00advations; McCarthy discussed protests by incarcerated individuals; Mukherjee discussed the unique considerations noncitizen protesters must face; Loor discussed racial justice protests and policing; and Racabi discussed labor strikes and workers as protesters. The panelists compared how protests in different spaces are regulated and examined what makes each type of protest more likely to shift public sentiment or secure insti\u00adtu\u00adtional concessions. Christensen\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>The Right to Protest in Indian Country<\/i>, asserts that between the three potential sovereigns impli\u00adcated by protests on indigenous lands\u2014the tribe, the state govern\u00adment, and the federal government\u2014tribal governments should be the sole regu\u00adlator of these protests.[footnote]See Grant Christensen, The Right to Protest in Indian Country, 125 Colum. L. Rev. 1139, 1153\u201378 (2025).[\/footnote] He then explores how tribes have his\u00adtorically reg\u00adulated protests and argues for tribes to take a measured approach to pro\u00adtest regulation despite not being bound by U.S. constitu\u00adtional restraints in the same way as a state or federal government.[footnote]See id. at 1178\u201391.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The fourth and final panel, \u201cPolicing Protests,\u201d featured Professors Amber Baylor, Jenny Carroll, Rachel Moran, and Sunita Patel as well as Nick Robinson, a senior legal adviser at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] The panelists discussed the regulation and policing of protests, including the passage of new antiprotest laws as a reaction to pro\u00adtest movements, the disproportionate impact that protest laws have on marginalized people, and the legal remedies available when protest regu\u00adlators violate protesters\u2019 constitutional or statutory rights. The panel\u00adists also commented on Moran\u2019s[footnote]Moran, supra note 16.[\/footnote] and Patel\u2019s[footnote]Patel, supra note 25.[\/footnote] Symposium pieces. Moran\u2019s piece, <i>Overbroad Protest Laws<\/i>, examines the First Amendment\u2019s overbreadth doctrine as it applies to protest laws and identifies the harms of overbroad protest laws.[footnote]Moran, supra note 16, at 1204\u201306.[\/footnote] She also enumerates five characteristic fea\u00adtures of potentially overbroad protest laws and uses them to analyze the constitutionality of several recent protest laws.[footnote]Id. at 1217\u201324 (identifying the five features); see also id. at 1255\u201361 (applying the five \u201cfeatures of overbroad protest laws\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0[to] four laws enacted since 2020 to assess them for potential overbreadth\u201d).[\/footnote] Patel\u2019s piece, <i>Policing Campus Protest<\/i>, discusses the various approaches universities have taken to regulating campus protests throughout history, identifying inter\u00adnal and external pressures on university regulators and analyzing three recurring tactics that campus police use when policing protests.[footnote]Patel, supra note 25, at 1293\u2013317.[\/footnote] Near the end of the piece, she shares some historical examples of when cam\u00adpus admin\u00adistrators opted to negotiate with, rather than punish, student protesters, suggesting that these moments might provide a lesson for universities going forward.[footnote]Id. at 1373 (\u201c[Some university presidents] knew headlines, criticism, and poten-tially more demonstrations would follow massive police repression, so they chose negotia\u00adtion over crackdown.

For more about Purnell\u2019s journey and insight as a protester, specifically within the police abolition movement but also in support of a wide variety of causes, see generally Derecka Purnell, Becoming Abolitionists: Police, Protests, and the Pursuit of Freedom (2021).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThis Symposium Issue of the <i>Columbia Law Review <\/i>features the five pieces described above, as well as Hansford\u2019s lecture. The Issue inten\u00adtion\u00adally places these six works of scholarship, each examining aspects of pro\u00adtest law, in dialogue with each other. A few examples help illustrate this. Abu El-Haj, Hansford, and Moran each take different approaches to addressing shortcomings in existing First Amendment doctrine.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, supra note 35, at 1096\u2013122 (developing \u201c[a]n independent Assembly Clause doctrine\u201d); Hansford, supra note 17, at 1030\u201331 (employing \u201ccritical race theory concepts\u201d to \u201cilluminate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0a framework for effectively analyzing the past, present, and future of First Amendment law regarding protests\u201d); Moran, supra note 16, at 1217\u201324 (identifying \u201cfive features of potentially overbroad laws drawn from the [Supreme] Court\u2019s overbreadth juris\u00adprudence\u201d).[\/footnote] Patel and Toussaint both turn to history as they illustrate how campus protest polic\u00ading and the Black protest tradition developed.[footnote]See Patel, supra note 25, at section 1293\u2013305; Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1381\u201382 (\u201cBy examin\u00ading historical instances of Black resistance, from slavery revolts to contemporary move\u00adments, and analyzing them through an Afrofuturist lens, this Piece reveals three core dimensions of Black protest\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Perhaps these scholars are employing the Sankofa principle Hansford writes about. See Hansford, supra note 17, at 1032 (\u201cThe Sankofa prin\u00adciple counsels the wis\u00addom of predicating future action on past patterns.\u201d).[\/footnote] Christensen, Moran, and Patel address the issue of protest regulation\u2014discussing <i>who<\/i> should regulate protests and <i>how<\/i> they should do so.[footnote]See Christensen, supra note 41, at 1153\u201378 (surveying the \u201cthree competing sover\u00adeigns: tribes, states, and the federal government\u201d and arguing \u201conly Indian tribes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0[should] govern[] protests that occur in Indian country\u201d); Moran, supra note 16, at 1261\u201368 (discussing the \u201charms of overbroad laws in the context of protest-related arrests and prosecutions\u201d); Patel, supra note 25, at 1335\u201365 (discussing \u201cfeatures of campus policing in response to protests\u201d).[\/footnote] Abu El-Haj and Toussaint both propose new frameworks for understanding protests as a part of our society: the political value of a public assembly and protest as a moral imperative.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, supra note 35, at 1053 (\u201cBeing together physically and socially con\u00adtributes to democracy in ways that are distinct from the contribution of public discourse.\u201d); Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1422 (\u201c[R]esistance is not just a right but a duty\u2014a necessary response to systemic injustice.\u201d).[\/footnote] This list of connections and throughlines is not exhaustive. Each scholar\u2019s contribution seeks to spur further thought, dis\u00adcussion, and scholarship in the field of protest law.\r\n\r\nFinally, in addition to engaging with pressing legal and philosophi\u00adcal questions surrounding the law of protest, this Symposium fostered a sense of community among the scholars, practitioners, students, and activists it brought together.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30 (describing \u201chow a symposium can bring peo\u00adple together to talk and [show] how scholarship can be collaborative and purposeful\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shaunak Puri, Symp. &amp; Book Rev.

The day-long conference on November 15, 2024, featured four panels and was bookended by two keynote speakers.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] The event opened with a lecture from Professor Justin Hansford, who dis\u00adcussed his experience as a legal observer during the protests following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.[footnote]See id. Professor Hansford\u2019s Lecture is published as part of this Symposium Issue. Hansford, supra note 17.[\/footnote] Hansford then drew on two critical race theory concepts\u2014interest convergence and the \u201ccritique of neutrality rhetoric\u201d\u2014using them as a lens to better understand protest law.[footnote]See Hansford, supra note 17, at 1030, 1032, 1040 (\u201c[W]e can clarify our understanding by framing our reading of protest law with fundamental critical race theory concepts.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Next, Professors Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Evelyn Douek, Jeremy Kessler, and Eugene Volokh, as well as Charles F. Walker, a former law firm part\u00adner and pro bono co-chair, discussed \u201cProtests and the Constitution,\u201d focusing on the First Amendment. This panel addressed the Amendment\u2019s speech\u2013conduct distinction, hate speech, online content moderation, and the reg\u00adulation of public versus private universities. The pan\u00adelists also reacted[footnote]See Behind the Scenes, supra note 30 (\u201cThe panels not only offered dynamic conversations and Q&amp;As for an audience of students and academics, but also provided val\u00aduable feedback for the authors, whose pieces were still in the process of being edited.\u201d).[\/footnote] to Abu El-Haj\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>A Right of Peaceable Assembly<\/i>, in which she proposes an independent Assembly Clause doctrine, distinct from the existing free speech doctrine derived from the First Amendment\u2019s Speech Clause.[footnote]Tabatha Abu El-Haj, A Right of Peaceable Assembly, 125 Colum. L. Rev. 1049, 1096 (2025) (\u201cAn independent Assembly Clause doctrine would not just be consistent with the text and the Founders\u2019 original understanding but would allow for the development of a coherent jurisprudence capable of distinguishing between protected and unprotected assemblies in relation to assembly\u2019s distinct contribution to self-governance.\u201d).[\/footnote] She argues assembly doc\u00adtrine provides a more apt framework for balancing protesters\u2019 rights against social costsby recognizing that the public\u2019s act of gathering and taking up space itself possesses political value, separate from the protest\u2019s expressive message.[footnote]See id. at 1054 (\u201cFreed of the wholly expressive account of assembly, it becomes possible to understand why an independent Assembly Clause doctrine is warranted and could make a material difference for those who gather in public.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The second panel examined \u201cProtests Through History.\u201d[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] Professors Deborah Dinner, Bernard E. Harcourt, Karuna Mantena, Dylan C. Penningroth, and Etienne Toussaint discussed common trends in racial justice, gender equality, and anti-war movements, as well as the lessons that can be drawn from historical protest movements and the responses they encountered. Toussaint\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>Afrofuturism in Protest: Dissent and Revolution<\/i>, chronicles the his\u00adtory of Black protest movements in the United States from the colonial era to the twenty-first century and examines these movements\u2019 philosophical underpinnings.[footnote]Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1382\u201383.[\/footnote] He argues that the Black radical tradition reveals protest to be not just a right, but a moral impera\u00adtive, and illustrates how modern protest movements can draw inspiration from that tradition.[footnote]Id. at 1453\u201364.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Professors Grant Christensen, Elora Mukherjee, Karen J. Pita Loor, and Gali Racabi, as well as law student Kevin McCarthy, spoke together on the third panel, titled \u201cWho Protests, and Where? Examining Protest Spaces.\u201d[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] Each panelist offered their perspective on a particular type of protest or protester: Christensen discussed protests on indigenous reser\u00advations; McCarthy discussed protests by incarcerated individuals; Mukherjee discussed the unique considerations noncitizen protesters must face; Loor discussed racial justice protests and policing; and Racabi discussed labor strikes and workers as protesters. The panelists compared how protests in different spaces are regulated and examined what makes each type of protest more likely to shift public sentiment or secure insti\u00adtu\u00adtional concessions. Christensen\u2019s Symposium piece, <i>The Right to Protest in Indian Country<\/i>, asserts that between the three potential sovereigns impli\u00adcated by protests on indigenous lands\u2014the tribe, the state govern\u00adment, and the federal government\u2014tribal governments should be the sole regu\u00adlator of these protests.[footnote]See Grant Christensen, The Right to Protest in Indian Country, 125 Colum. L. Rev. 1139, 1153\u201378 (2025).[\/footnote] He then explores how tribes have his\u00adtorically reg\u00adulated protests and argues for tribes to take a measured approach to pro\u00adtest regulation despite not being bound by U.S. constitu\u00adtional restraints in the same way as a state or federal government.[footnote]See id. at 1178\u201391.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The fourth and final panel, \u201cPolicing Protests,\u201d featured Professors Amber Baylor, Jenny Carroll, Rachel Moran, and Sunita Patel as well as Nick Robinson, a senior legal adviser at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] The panelists discussed the regulation and policing of protests, including the passage of new antiprotest laws as a reaction to pro\u00adtest movements, the disproportionate impact that protest laws have on marginalized people, and the legal remedies available when protest regu\u00adlators violate protesters\u2019 constitutional or statutory rights. The panel\u00adists also commented on Moran\u2019s[footnote]Moran, supra note 16.[\/footnote] and Patel\u2019s[footnote]Patel, supra note 25.[\/footnote] Symposium pieces. Moran\u2019s piece, <i>Overbroad Protest Laws<\/i>, examines the First Amendment\u2019s overbreadth doctrine as it applies to protest laws and identifies the harms of overbroad protest laws.[footnote]Moran, supra note 16, at 1204\u201306.[\/footnote] She also enumerates five characteristic fea\u00adtures of potentially overbroad protest laws and uses them to analyze the constitutionality of several recent protest laws.[footnote]Id. at 1217\u201324 (identifying the five features); see also id. at 1255\u201361 (applying the five \u201cfeatures of overbroad protest laws\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0[to] four laws enacted since 2020 to assess them for potential overbreadth\u201d).[\/footnote] Patel\u2019s piece, <i>Policing Campus Protest<\/i>, discusses the various approaches universities have taken to regulating campus protests throughout history, identifying inter\u00adnal and external pressures on university regulators and analyzing three recurring tactics that campus police use when policing protests.[footnote]Patel, supra note 25, at 1293\u2013317.[\/footnote] Near the end of the piece, she shares some historical examples of when cam\u00adpus admin\u00adistrators opted to negotiate with, rather than punish, student protesters, suggesting that these moments might provide a lesson for universities going forward.[footnote]Id. at 1373 (\u201c[Some university presidents] knew headlines, criticism, and poten-tially more demonstrations would follow massive police repression, so they chose negotia\u00adtion over crackdown. These historic examples could serve as lessons for today\u2019s uni\u00adversity presidents and students.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The conference concluded with a keynote address by Derecka Purnell, a movement lawyer and activist.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30.[\/footnote] Purnell explored the relation\u00adship between movement lawyering and out-on-the-street activism, identi\u00adfy\u00ading a tension between working within a system and seeking to radically change a system from the outside.[footnote]See id. For more about Purnell\u2019s journey and insight as a protester, specifically within the police abolition movement but also in support of a wide variety of causes, see generally Derecka Purnell, Becoming Abolitionists: Police, Protests, and the Pursuit of Freedom (2021).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThis Symposium Issue of the <i>Columbia Law Review <\/i>features the five pieces described above, as well as Hansford\u2019s lecture. The Issue inten\u00adtion\u00adally places these six works of scholarship, each examining aspects of pro\u00adtest law, in dialogue with each other. A few examples help illustrate this. Abu El-Haj, Hansford, and Moran each take different approaches to addressing shortcomings in existing First Amendment doctrine.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, supra note 35, at 1096\u2013122 (developing \u201c[a]n independent Assembly Clause doctrine\u201d); Hansford, supra note 17, at 1030\u201331 (employing \u201ccritical race theory concepts\u201d to \u201cilluminate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0a framework for effectively analyzing the past, present, and future of First Amendment law regarding protests\u201d); Moran, supra note 16, at 1217\u201324 (identifying \u201cfive features of potentially overbroad laws drawn from the [Supreme] Court\u2019s overbreadth juris\u00adprudence\u201d).[\/footnote] Patel and Toussaint both turn to history as they illustrate how campus protest polic\u00ading and the Black protest tradition developed.[footnote]See Patel, supra note 25, at section 1293\u2013305; Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1381\u201382 (\u201cBy examin\u00ading historical instances of Black resistance, from slavery revolts to contemporary move\u00adments, and analyzing them through an Afrofuturist lens, this Piece reveals three core dimensions of Black protest\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Perhaps these scholars are employing the Sankofa principle Hansford writes about. See Hansford, supra note 17, at 1032 (\u201cThe Sankofa prin\u00adciple counsels the wis\u00addom of predicating future action on past patterns.\u201d).[\/footnote] Christensen, Moran, and Patel address the issue of protest regulation\u2014discussing <i>who<\/i> should regulate protests and <i>how<\/i> they should do so.[footnote]See Christensen, supra note 41, at 1153\u201378 (surveying the \u201cthree competing sover\u00adeigns: tribes, states, and the federal government\u201d and arguing \u201conly Indian tribes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0[should] govern[] protests that occur in Indian country\u201d); Moran, supra note 16, at 1261\u201368 (discussing the \u201charms of overbroad laws in the context of protest-related arrests and prosecutions\u201d); Patel, supra note 25, at 1335\u201365 (discussing \u201cfeatures of campus policing in response to protests\u201d).[\/footnote] Abu El-Haj and Toussaint both propose new frameworks for understanding protests as a part of our society: the political value of a public assembly and protest as a moral imperative.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, supra note 35, at 1053 (\u201cBeing together physically and socially con\u00adtributes to democracy in ways that are distinct from the contribution of public discourse.\u201d); Toussaint, supra note 3, at 1422 (\u201c[R]esistance is not just a right but a duty\u2014a necessary response to systemic injustice.\u201d).[\/footnote] This list of connections and throughlines is not exhaustive. Each scholar\u2019s contribution seeks to spur further thought, dis\u00adcussion, and scholarship in the field of protest law.\r\n\r\nFinally, in addition to engaging with pressing legal and philosophi\u00adcal questions surrounding the law of protest, this Symposium fostered a sense of community among the scholars, practitioners, students, and activists it brought together.[footnote]Behind the Scenes, supra note 30 (describing \u201chow a symposium can bring peo\u00adple together to talk and [show] how scholarship can be collaborative and purposeful\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shaunak Puri, Symp. &amp; Book Rev. Ed., Colum. L. Rev.)).[\/footnote] In that way, the Symposium mirrored the protests it examined: Protesters come together with a shared goal\u2014to challenge injustice and demand accountability\u2014and in doing so, they, too, develop a feeling of community.[footnote]See Angela Y. Davis, Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement 1\u20132 (Frank Barat ed., 2016) (discussing the \u201cdangers of indi\u00advidualism\u201d and the strength of collective action in \u201c[p]rogressive struggles\u201d).[\/footnote] That feeling is one of the most power\u00adful, inspiring, and sustaining aspects of any protest. [footnote]See Radhule Weininger, Do Demonstrations Make a Difference?, Santa Barbara Indep. (Apr. 10, 2025), https:\/\/www.independent.com\/2025\/04\/10\/do-demonstrations-make\u200c-a-difference\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/Y2UQ-ERQP] (\u201c[Political and social demonstrations] build solidarity and community, making us feel connected and less afraid.\u201d); see also, e.g., Emily Chen &amp; Joyce Zhang, \u2018Solidarity Materialized\u2019: A Look Into the Art and Community Born Out of the \u2018Gaza Solidarity Encampment\u2019, Colum. Spectator (Apr. 28, 2024), https:\/\/www.columbiaspectator.com\/arts-and-culture\/2024\/04\u200c\/28\/\u200csolidarity-materialized-a-look-into-the-art-and-community-born-out-of-the-gaza-solidar\u200city-encampment\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/S43S-BJYG].[\/footnote] There is an energy that emanates from collective action, reverberating through chants and slogans, transcending differences in background, ideology, or personal experience. Protesters forge connec\u00adtions with one another that are not simply tactical but deeply empathetic, human, and long-lasting.[footnote]See Deepa Iyer, We Too Sing America: South Asian, Arab, Muslim, and Sikh Immigrants Shape Our Multiracial Future 167 (2015) (\u201cMany racial justice activists say that engaging in conversations and dialogues with one another about our experiences with racial identity, oppression, and injustice can help us understand that we have linked fates and futures.\u201d).[\/footnote] Ulti\u00admately, protests reinforce the notion that no one is alone in their strug\u00adgle: Together, in solidarity, all share a com\u00admitment to making the world better today and for future generations.\r\n\r\n<\/div>",
