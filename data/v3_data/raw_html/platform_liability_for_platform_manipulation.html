				<p>Platform manipulation is a growing phenomenon affecting billions of internet users globally. Malicious actors leverage the functions and features of online platforms to deceive users, secure financial gain, inflict material harms, and erode the public’s trust. Although social media companies benefit from a safe harbor for their content policies, no state or federal law clearly ascribes liability to platforms complicit in deception by their designs. Existing frameworks fail to accommodate for the unique role design choices play in enabling, amplifying, and monitoring platform manipulation. As a result, platform manipulation continues to grow with few meaningful legal avenues of recourse available to victims.</p>
<p>This Note introduces a paradigm of corporate liability for social media platforms that facilitate platform manipulation. It argues that courts must appreciate platform design as a dimension of corporate conduct by explicating the extension of common law tort liability to platform design. This Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm crucially clarifies the bounds of accountability for the design choices of social media companies and is well-suited to respond to the law’s systemic discounting of platform design. Existing legal frameworks fail to account for the unique and content-agnostic enmeshment between platforms and those who manipulate platforms to abuse users. PDN in turn offers a constitutive baseline for a society with less rampant technology-enabled deception.</p>

		“Manipulation” offers three meanings in the context of liability for social media companies. In this Note, “manipulation” in “platform manipulation” primarily refers to the practices of malicious actors, such as scammers, who exploit the design of platforms to achieve their desired outcomes. These manipulators largely seek to deceive platform users to secure financial gain. In this way, “platform manipulation” is a triple entendre; it refers to malicious actors’ manipulation of the design of social media platforms, malicious actors’ manipulation of social media users, and platforms’ own manipulation of their users by way of their platform design.	</span>

 The cornerstone of social media law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, as well as First Amendment law and consumer law frameworks, all either fail to provide recourse to social media scam victims or fail to explain legislative inaction in the face of the causal relationship between platforms’ design choices and the scams that transpire on those very same platforms.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p class="Document">This Note is the first to argue for a social media liability paradigm that centers platform design choices: a Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm that establishes the circumstances for a clear assumption of liability in this digital environment. It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p class="Document">In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice. It also explores how social media companies profit from the scam economy. Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies’ design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.</p>

It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice.

Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies\u2019 design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

For example, platforms make design choices on how to display features; hiding the \u201creply all\u201d feature can reduce accidental mass replies, while hiding the number of digits in passcodes can provide additional security. Though some social media companies have adopted platform designs that mitigate harms like cyberbullying and misinformation,[footnote]See Amer Owaida, Instagram Rolls Out New Features to Help Prevent Cyberbullying, We Live Sec.

It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice. It also explores how social media companies profit from the scam economy. Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies\u2019 design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice.

Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies\u2019 design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

For example, platforms make design choices on how to display features; hiding the \u201creply all\u201d feature can reduce accidental mass replies, while hiding the number of digits in passcodes can provide additional security. Though some social media companies have adopted platform designs that mitigate harms like cyberbullying and misinformation,[footnote]See Amer Owaida, Instagram Rolls Out New Features to Help Prevent Cyberbullying, We Live Sec.

It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice. It also explores how social media companies profit from the scam economy. Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies\u2019 design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",
