				<p>Freedom of thought has long been revered as a fundamental right, yet its doctrinal contours have remained underdeveloped. Two recent Supreme Court decisions<em>—National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (NIFLA) </em>and <em>303 Creative LLC v. Elenis—</em>suggest a nascent but expansive free thought jurisprudence, one that increasingly shields religious actors not just from government interference in belief but also compliance with generally applicable laws.</p>
<p>For decades, the Supreme Court had maintained several guardrails to cabin religious practice without unduly infringing on religious thought. These guardrails—evaluating the government’s purpose behind a law, considering whether a religious exemption would cause third-party harm, and questioning the sincerity of a religious plaintiff—have ensured that religiously motivated conduct does not override neutral laws. <em>NIFLA</em> and <em>303 Creative</em>, though, weaken these constraints and offer plaintiffs a roadmap to use free thought to challenge a wide range of laws, including antidiscrimination protections, workplace regulations, and public health measures.</p>
<p>This Piece examines the erosion of these guardrails and argues that, without intervention, religious free thought could become an unchecked tool for breaking the law. It concludes by proposing doctrinal recalibrations to preserve freedom of thought without allowing it to imperil the rights and dignity of others.</p>

		See, e.g., Marc Jonathan Blitz, Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution, 2010 Wis. L. Rev. 1049, 1051 (describing how the Supreme Court and scholars view freedom of thought as broader than freedom of speech); Matthew B. Lawrence, Addiction and Liberty, 108 Cornell L. Rev. 259, 261 (2023) (“The Supreme Court has repeatedly described ‘freedom of thought’ as a key aspect of the liberty that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to protect.”); see also Jerome A. Barron, Access to the Press–A New First Amendment Right, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1641, 1649 (1967) (“Justice Cardozo clearly indicated that while many rights could be eliminated and yet ‘justice’ not undone, ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist . . . [without] freedom of thought and speech’ since free expression is ‘the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.’” (alterations in original) (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325–27 (1937))); Rafael Domingo, Restoring Freedom of Conscience, 30 J.L. &amp; Religion 176, 176 (2015) (“Freedom of thought is required for the human person as a rational being . . . .”); Charles Fried, Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice, 78 B.U. L. Rev. 717, 723–24 (1998) (“By speaking of freedom of thought I wish to push to the fore exactly that which developed First Amendment doctrine . . . seeks to establish: that the state has no business seeking to control—that is, to prohibit or command—the minds of its citizens.”); Jed Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737, 754 (1989) (“Thus, the freedom of self-definition would be the fundamental human right, of which, for example, the freedoms of thought and belief embodied in the first amendment would count as necessary but insufficient components.”).	</span>

		See, e.g., Blitz, supra note 1, at 1051 (acknowledging that as “central as freedom of thought is to our constitutional system, . . . the Supreme Court has never said exactly what this freedom is,” and questioning whether “freedom of thought [can] stand on its own”); Recent Case, <i>Doe v. City of Lafayette</i>,<i> </i>377 F.3d 757 (7th Cir. 2004) (en banc), 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1054, 1054 (2005) (“Numerous Supreme Court decisions have proclaimed that the First Amendment protects freedom of mind or thought. These statements, however, have usually been dicta; only a few cases have actually been decided on freedom of thought grounds.” (footnote omitted)).	</span>

If . . . [so], there is nothing particularly special about freedom of thought from a free speech perspective.”); Wayne Unger, Stay Out of My Head: Neurodata, Privacy, and the First Amendment, 80 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1439, 1494 (2023) (“First Amendment liberties have a ‘double aspect’ in that the freedoms of speech, press, and religion are more fundamentally the freedoms of thought and action.” (quoting Jones v.

 Even so, attendees of the free thought renaissance fair often skip over an important point: The Supreme Court has, over the last several years, in fact laid out what a more robust free thought doctrine might look like in practice. And that vision should give pause even to free thought’s most ardent champions.</p>

		On this issue, Professor Adam Winkler’s research has been particularly instructive. In 2006, Winkler published a study examining every federal district and circuit court decision raising a religious liberty claim in the fifteen years after <i>Smith. </i>Adam Winkler, Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time—i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-<i>Smith</i>, having little problem actually applying <i>Smith</i>’s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion.	</span>

 Like the peyote ban in <i>Smith</i>, there is little evidence that the city intended, through its antidiscrimination provision, to single out or target religion.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class="Document">The unraveling of these guardrails—purpose, harm, and sincerity—helped pave the way for <i>NIFLA </i>and <i>303 Creative</i>.<i> </i>Had purpose been an actual check on religious exercise, neither <i>NIFLA </i>nor <i>303 Creative </i>should have gotten off the ground in the first place, since the laws at issue had nothing to do with religion: California wanted to promote public health; Colorado wanted to root out invidious discrimination. Had the Court thought of harm the way it did in <i>Lee</i>,<i> Piggie Park</i>, or <i>Bob Jones University</i>, the <i>NIFLA </i>and <i>303 Creative </i>plaintiffs also would not have had much of a case. And had anyone bothered to examine sincerity, one should have at the very least questioned why <i>303 Creative </i>plaintiff Lorie Smith felt the need to sue even though no same sex couple had ever asked her to design a wedding page<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p class="Document">But when purpose, harm, and sincerity no longer work, what remains is the sort of radical conception of religious free thought expressed in <i>NIFLA </i>and <i>303 Creative</i>. That freedom has long prevented the government from interfering with one’s religious beliefs. But today it also allows a plaintiff to break laws (1) that have nothing to do with religion, (2) regardless of the harm to others, (3) so long as they claim they did so for religious reasons. That result cannot be what anyone wants.</p>

<p class="Document">Still, even if the Court were to course correct on its law and religion jurisprudence, that <i>NIFLA </i>and <i>303 Creative </i>came out the way they did prompts a final question: Should we, going forward, still think of and treat freedom of thought as an unbounded, fundamental right?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Document">It seems that, even if the government cannot necessarily tell people what to think, it can and does tell people what <i>it</i> thinks. And its message is often abundantly clear. The Civil Rights Act tells us not to discriminate because, as a democracy, we have collectively decided that doing so is both harmful and illegal. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells us to accommodate those with certain needs, for substantially the same reasons. So too does the government communicate a message with the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Endangered Species Act. All of us have the freedom to think what we want individually. But should any of our individual thoughts be able to, as a matter of right, override the thoughts and welfare of the collective whole?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Document">Furthermore, whatever the freedom of thought is supposed to protect, it simply cannot give open license to an unfettered freedom of action. The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in <i>303 Creative </i>shows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 It is not necessarily or readily apparent where this syllogism breaks down. But the result—an all-too-robust freedom of thought—cannot be squared with a rule of law that respects the dignity and rights of all persons. Figuring out how and where and in what way to intervene in this logical chain is a prerequisite to embracing a more expansive freedom of thought for all.</p>

Kobler, Two Views of First Amendment Thought Privacy, 18 U. Pa. J. Con. L. 1381, 1386\u201387 (2016) (\u201cOne important question that courts have never resolved is whether freedom of thought is only protected by the [First] Amendment in cases that implicate expression.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

Opelika, 316 U.S. 584, 618 (1942) (Murphy, J., dissenting))).[\/footnote] Today, though, the ever-increasing encroachment of technology has turned freedom of thought into the go-to answer for any number of modern ills, from social media manipulation,[footnote]See Susie Alegre, We\u2019re Dangerously Close to Giving Big Tech Control of Our Thoughts, Time (June 29, 2022), https:\/\/time.com\/6191973\/big-tech-freedom-of-thought\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/D4MJ-69UG] (explaining that social media platforms can be \u201cpowerful tool[s] for manipulation\u201d).[\/footnote] to data harvesting,[footnote]See Jane Bambauer, Is Data Speech?, 66 Stan. L. Rev. 57, 64 (2014) (arguing that \u201cdata should receive speech protection any time it is regulated <i>as<\/i> information\u201d).[\/footnote] to substance abuse.[footnote]See Lawrence, supra note 1, at 263 (identifying a freedom from addiction as a fundamental liberty interest and explaining that \u201cthe right to freedom from addiction manifests as a legal tool to protect Americans\u2019 freedom of thought\u201d).[\/footnote] Even so, attendees of the free thought renaissance fair often skip over an important point: The Supreme Court has, over the last several years, in fact laid out what a more robust free thought doctrine might look like in practice. And that vision should give pause even to free thought\u2019s most ardent champions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2>I. <em>NIFLA<\/em> and <em>303 Creative<\/em><\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The Court has referred to the freedom of thought by name twice in the past decade. The first time was seven years ago in <i>National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra <\/i>(<i>NIFLA<\/i>).[footnote]138 S. Ct. 2361 (2018).[\/footnote] There, several crisis pregnancy centers[footnote]\u00a0 Crisis pregnancy centers are \u201cfacilities that represent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion.\u201d Am. Coll. of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, Issue Brief: Crisis Pregnancy Centers 1 (2020), https:\/\/www.acog.org\/-\/media\/project\/acog\/acogorg\/files\/advocacy\/issue-briefs\/crisis-pregnancy-centers.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/5NDQ-EYL3]. They are often operated by nonmedical personnel. Id.[\/footnote] challenged a California law requiring them to post notices about the availability of \u201clow-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2369 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a0123472(a)(1) (2016)).[\/footnote] According to a study the legislature commissioned to aid it in drafting the legislation, most crisis pregnancy centers were \u201cpro-life\u201d organizations whose \u201caim [was] to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2368 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Casey Watters, Meg Keaney &amp; Natalie Evans, Pub. L. Rsrch. Inst., Pregnancy Resource Centers: Ensuring Access and Accuracy of Information 4 (2011)).[\/footnote] The notice requirement sought to ensure that pregnant women were aware of all available reproductive services, not just the limited range offered by the centers.[footnote]Id. at 2369.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The centers saw the issue differently. They objected to \u201cprovid[ing] a government-drafted script about the availability of state-sponsored services,\u201d including \u201cabortion\u2014the very practice\u201d they were \u201cdevoted to opposing.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2371.[\/footnote] The Court agreed, and held that the notice likely constituted an impermissible regulation of speech.[footnote]Id. at 2378.[\/footnote] Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a concurrence joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, went a step further and invoked freedom of thought as a basis behind his decision: \u201cGovernments,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cmust not be allowed to force persons to express a message contrary to their deepest convictions.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2379 (Kennedy, J., concurring).[\/footnote] That is because the \u201c[f]reedom of speech secures freedom of thought and belief,\u201d and California\u2019s \u201claw imperils those liberties.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The next (and, at the time of this writing, most recent) occasion in which the Court discussed freedom of thought was <i>303 Creative LLC<\/i> <i>v. Elenis<\/i>.[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2298 (2023).[\/footnote]<i> <\/i>In that case, plaintiff Lorie Smith refused to design wedding webpages for same-sex couples because doing so purportedly offended \u201c[h]er belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2309 (citing Appendix to Petition for a Writ of Certiorari at 179a, 143 S. Ct. 2298 (No. 21-476),\u00a0 2021 WL 4459045).[\/footnote] The Court sided with Smith, holding a Colorado antidiscrimination law unconstitutional as applied to her.[footnote]Id. at 2321\u201322.[\/footnote] In so doing, the Court\u2019s majority opinion, written by Justice Gorsuch, returned to and expounded upon the themes Justice Kennedy articulated in <i>NIFLA<\/i>. Justice Gorsuch emphasized that the \u201cframers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to protect the \u2018freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2310 (quoting Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 660\u201361 (2000)).[\/footnote] \u201c[T]he freedom to think and speak,\u201d he stressed, \u201cis among our inalienable human rights,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2311.[\/footnote] and \u201cthe opportunity to think for ourselves and to express those thoughts freely is among our most cherished liberties and part of what keeps our Republic strong.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2321.[\/footnote] Colorado \u201cseeks to deny that promise\u201d to its citizens by forcing them to speak in a manner that contravenes their religious beliefs.[footnote]Id. at 2322.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative<\/i> both involved the intersection of free thought and religious exercise. That fact alone is not particularly surprising, as thought and religion have long been intertwined.[footnote]See, e.g., United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944) (\u201cFreedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.\u201d (citing W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943))); Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584, 618 (1942) (Murphy, J., dissenting) (\u201cFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion all have a double aspect\u2014freedom of thought and freedom of action.\u201d); Laurence H. Tribe &amp; Michael C. Dorf, Levels of Generality in the Definition of Rights, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1057, 1069 (1990) (explaining \u201cJustice Harlan\u2019s point was that the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and so forth make sense only if connected by a broader and underlying principle of freedom of thought and conscience\u201d).[\/footnote] What is remarkable, though, is <i>how<\/i> the Court connected these two concepts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">To see why, consider the types of laws at issue in these cases. Governments can, and often do, require businesses to display notices, just like the notices in <i>NIFLA<\/i>\u2014consider the warnings one sees on cigarette packs[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a0104550 (2025) (describing requirements for cigar labeling).[\/footnote] and pesticide bottles,[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 3, \u00a7\u00a06678 (2025) (describing requirements for service container labeling).[\/footnote] or the signs one might see in a grocery store or doctor\u2019s office.[footnote]See, e.g., N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law \u00a7\u00a0214-m (McKinney 2025) (requiring labeling for certain food products).[\/footnote]Governments can, and also often do, seek to protect their citizens from discrimination, just like Colorado tried to do with its antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020) (\u201cAn employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\u201d); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 677 (2015)(\u201cThe dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.\u201d);<i> <\/i>John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review 74 (1980) (noting that, according to some scholars, the \u201ctwo broad concerns of the Warren Court\u2014with clearing the channels of political change on the one hand, and with correcting certain kinds of discrimination against minorities on the other\u2014fit together to form a coherent theory of representative government\u201d).[\/footnote] Many object to both sorts of laws. No one thinks Philip Morris wants to tell its customers that smoking kills on each pack of Marlboros that they buy. And our shared history unfortunately makes clear that many businesses would freely discriminate based on race, sex, or sexual orientation if the law did not make it illegal for them to do so.[footnote]See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 243 (1964) (\u201cPrior to passage of the Act the motel had followed a practice of refusing to rent rooms to Negroes, and it alleged that it intended to continue to do so.

In <i>Employment Division v.

In <i>United States v.

Were it to open that door, \u201cit would be difficult to accommodate [a] comprehensive social security system with myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d\u2014a clear nod to the harm that other, non-religious parties would suffer.[footnote]Id. at 259\u201360 (majority opinion).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In addition to the sorts of financial harms in <i>Lee<\/i>, the Court has also refused to allow groups to impose dignitary harms on others in the name of religion.

During the 1950s and \u201960s, judges carefully examined whether a plaintiff\u2019s religious convictions were genuine and required respecting not only religious thought but also religious action.[footnote]See, e.g., Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382\u201383 (1955) (scrutinizing the sincerity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged religious objections to war).[\/footnote] To undertake that analysis, courts often asked plaintiffs to produce significant and voluminous evidence showing internal consistency of belief and practice.[footnote]See id.

But they have each fallen into disrepair.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Start with purpose. Despite a seemingly unending supply of literature criticizing <i>Smith<\/i>,[footnote]See, e.g., Blaine L. Hutchison, Revisiting<i> Employment Division v. Smith<\/i>, 91 U. Cin. L. Rev. 396, 399 (2022) (\u201cThe problem is <i>Smith<\/i>. <i>Smith<\/i> does not protect religious liberty or prevent religious persecution and conflict.\u201d); see also Allan Ides, The Text of the Free Exercise Clause as a Measure of<i>Employment Division v.

Rev. 1407, 1409 n.15 (1992) (listing law review articles critical of <i>Smith<\/i>).[\/footnote] the Court has declined to overrule the case.[footnote]See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 n.1 (2022) (\u201c[W]hile the [<i>Smith<\/i>] test we do apply today has been the subject of some criticism,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. we have no need to engage with that debate today because no party has asked us to do so.\u201d).[\/footnote] As a formal legal matter, generally applicable laws today remain insulated from legal challenge, while those targeting religion do not.[footnote]On this issue, Professor Adam Winkler\u2019s research has been particularly instructive. In 2006, Winkler published a study examining every federal district and circuit court decision raising a religious liberty claim in the fifteen years after <i>Smith. <\/i>Adam Winkler, Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time\u2014i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-<i>Smith<\/i>, having little problem actually applying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion.[\/footnote] What the Court <i>has<\/i> done, though, is redraw the lines of engagement so that only a vanishingly small number of laws are now considered generally applicable, and laws that have nothing to do with religion are categorized as targeting religious belief or practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia<\/i>, for example, Catholic Social Services (CSS) refused to comply with Philadelphia\u2019s foster care contract, which required prospective foster care\u2013placement organizations to certify that they would not discriminate based on protected characteristics.[footnote]141 S. Ct. 1868, 1874 (2021).[\/footnote] CSS objected, citing its belief that marriage was meant to be between a man and a woman.[footnote]Id. at 1875.[\/footnote] Like the peyote ban in <i>Smith<\/i>, there is little evidence that the city intended, through its antidiscrimination provision, to single out or target religion. But the Court nonetheless ruled in CSS\u2019s favor because a separate provision in the foster care contract contemplated an \u201cexception\u201d from this antidiscrimination requirement, to be granted at the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the City Commissioner.[footnote]Id. at 1878 (internal quotation marks omitted).[\/footnote] This provision, the Court opined, meant that the city\u2019s policy was not actually generally applicable, since the contract \u201cinvite[d]\u201d the government to consider the particular reasons for a person\u2019s conduct and \u201cdecide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1879 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990)).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Such a rule might at first glance seem innocuous. That is especially so because, were one only to read the <i>Fulton <\/i>majority opinion, one might easily have gotten the impression that the city was offering exemptions left and right to secular organizations, while declining them to religious ones. But that was not the case. The city, to be sure, had \u201cno intention of handing\u201d an exception to CSS.[footnote]Id. at 1887 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote] Yet it had also \u201c<i>never <\/i>granted such an exemption\u201d to anyone\u2014religious or secular.[footnote]Id. (emphasis added) (citing Brief for City Respondents at 36, <i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. (No. 19-123), 2020 WL 4819956).[\/footnote] No matter. What counted for the Court was that an exemption was <i>theoretically<\/i> possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">That feature, however, characterizes most laws. The pardon power, for example, creates an implicit exception to every criminal law.[footnote]See Michael A. Foster, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46179, Presidential Pardons: Overview and Selected Legal Issues 6 (2020) (\u201cThe federal courts have recognized that the power conferred by Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution is quite broad, establishing virtually \u2018unfettered executive discretion\u2019 to grant clemency.\u201d (quoting Hoffa v. Saxbe, 378 F. Supp. 1221, 1234 (D.D.C 1974))). As especially relevant here, many states vest the pardon power in the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the Governor or other Executive official, mirroring the \u201csole discretion\u201d language from Philadelphia\u2019s foster-care contract. See, e.g., Cal. Const. art. V, \u00a7\u00a08(a); Fla. Const. art. IV, \u00a7\u00a08(a).[\/footnote]Executive discretion recognizes a similar exception to federal immigration law.[footnote]Holly Straut-Eppsteiner, Cong. Rsch. Serv., IF12424, Immigration 101: Executive Branch Agencies Involved With Immigration 1 (2023) (\u201cWhile Congress has plenary power over immigration law, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Homeland Security Act (HSA), and other laws grant substantial discretion over immigration policy to the executive branch. Executive branch departments and their components have distinct yet overlapping responsibilities for immigration policy.\u201d). Indeed, even an individual that has been ordered removed can remain in the country pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01229b (2018) (providing for situations in which the Attorney General may cancel removal); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01182(h) (providing the Attorney General with discretion to grant waivers for certain grounds of inadmissibility).[\/footnote] And many environmental laws explicitly contemplate the granting of individualized waivers or exemptions.[footnote]Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency can grant waivers to states for specific emissions standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(b)(3) (2018).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">To grasp the mess that <i>Fulton <\/i>made, consider that a secular plaintiff would obviously not receive heightened review if they were to challenge any of the above laws.[footnote]The central purpose of rational basis review is to head off such challenges. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 15 (1992) (holding that equal protection \u201cdoes not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification\u201d (citing U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980))).[\/footnote] But if someone commits a crime and claims they did so for religious reasons, the government must prove\u2014at least if <i>Fulton<\/i> is to be taken seriously\u2014not only that it \u201chas a compelling interest in enforcing\u201d the law generally but also \u201can interest in denying an exception\u201d to a particular plaintiff.[footnote]<i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. at 1181.[\/footnote] The same would hold true if an individual or organization claimed a religious right to pollute. These sorts of scenarios go beyond merely modifying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. They gut it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Third-party harm follows a similar path, with the Court\u2019s approach to the contraceptive mandate offering a particularly instructive example. That mandate, a part of the Affordable Care Act, was meant to \u201cserve[] the Government\u2019s compelling interest in providing insurance coverage\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary to protect the health of female employees.\u201d[footnote]Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 737 (2014) (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also id. at 728 (majority opinion) (\u201cWe will assume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] As initially drafted, compliance was mandatory for nearly everyone, with a very narrow exception for churches that might object to the mandate on religious grounds.[footnote]Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2387\u201388 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring).[\/footnote] Almost immediately after that exemption went into effect, though, many other organizations complained, arguing that the exemption \u201cfurnished insufficient protection for\u201d their religious exercise (even if they were not, as a formal matter, in the religion business).[footnote]Id. at 2388.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These issues came to a head in <i>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.<\/i>, when a for-profit crafts company challenged the government\u2019s decision to limit its religious exemption to churches and their auxiliaries.[footnote]573 U.S. at 689\u201391.[\/footnote] Hobby Lobby did not argue that it was a church, a church-related organization, or even that its employees were all members of the same church or had the same views on contraception.[footnote]Id. at 700\u201304.[\/footnote] It instead insisted that, as a closely held corporation, its sincere beliefs should override the government\u2019s judgment regarding the availability and provisioning of reproductive health services.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The Court agreed.[footnote]See id. at 689\u201391 (holding that \u201cregulations that impose [an] obligation\u201d on \u201cclosely held corporations [to] provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies\u2019 owners\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. violate RFRA\u201d).[\/footnote] And by ruling in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor, the Court effectively required the government to extend an exemption to the contraceptive mandate to virtually any employer\u2014religious or secular, for-profit or nonprofit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court both under- and over-read <i>United States v. Lee<\/i>, the Amish taxpayer exemption case. It under-read <i>Lee <\/i>because, according to <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, courts should \u201cscrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants\u201d when evaluating third-party harm.[footnote]Id. at 726\u201327 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gonzales<i> <\/i>v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006)).[\/footnote] But that is not how <i>Lee <\/i>thought about harm. If it was, there would have been no issue in <i>Lee <\/i>with granting a tax exemption to the single objecting plaintiff that brought the case, since doing so would have been a \u201crelatively simple\u201d administrative matter and maybe, as Justice Stevens pointed out, even good fiscal policy.[footnote]United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 262 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote]Instead, <i>Lee <\/i>considered the harm that would result if <i>others<\/i> began seeking and obtaining a free pass from paying Social Security taxes.[footnote]See id. at 258\u201360 (majority opinion) (discussing the government\u2019s strong \u201cinterest in assuring mandatory and continuous participation in and contribution to\u201d the country\u2019s \u201cnationwide\u201d social security system and describing how \u201cdifficult [it would be] to accommodate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d).[\/footnote] That scenario, of one exemption leading to many, stands in stark contrast to the constrained assessment of the marginal benefits and costs of granting a one-off exemption in <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>.[footnote]See <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, 573 U.S. at 721\u201326 (discussing the costs of an exemption to the ACA).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>Hobby Lobby <\/i>also over-read <i>Lee <\/i>because it characterized the case as a challenge to the entire tax system.[footnote]See id. at 734 (\u201cOur holding in <i>Lee<\/i> turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation.\u201d).[\/footnote] Such a characterization had the benefit of making the <i>Hobby Lobby <\/i>plaintiffs seem more reasonable, since they were only seeking to excuse themselves from one part of the \u201cACA\u2019s comprehensive scheme.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 735.[\/footnote] But that characterization was incorrect. <i>Lee <\/i>did not involve a wholesale attack on the tax system. The plaintiff objected only to paying social security taxes, not all state or federal taxes.[footnote]<i>Lee<\/i>, 455 U.S. at 255 (describing the Amish community as \u201creligiously opposed to the national social security system\u201d specifically because \u201cthe Amish believe it sinful not to provide for their own elderly and needy\u201d).[\/footnote] It was the Court which inferred that a successful challenge for one employer on one form of taxation would inevitably lead to challenges by other employers to other forms of taxation.[footnote]See id. at 260 (arguing that \u201c[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief\u201d).[\/footnote] <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i> declined to undertake such an analysis; the Court insisted on looking at the facts of the singular plaintiff, rather than considering whether its ruling would lead to a dramatic rise in exemption requests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The practical effect of <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>\u2019s under- and over-reading of <i>Lee <\/i>is to minimize consideration of third-party harm in law and religion cases.

And its message is often abundantly clear. The Civil Rights Act tells us not to discriminate because, as a democracy, we have collectively decided that doing so is both harmful and illegal. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells us to accommodate those with certain needs, for substantially the same reasons. So too does the government communicate a message with the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Endangered Species Act. All of us have the freedom to think what we want individually. But should any of our individual thoughts be able to, as a matter of right, override the thoughts and welfare of the collective whole?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Furthermore, whatever the freedom of thought is supposed to protect, it simply cannot give open license to an unfettered freedom of action. The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in <i>303 Creative <\/i>shows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.[footnote]303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S.

That fact alone is not particularly surprising, as thought and religion have long been intertwined.[footnote]See, e.g., United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944) (\u201cFreedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.\u201d (citing W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v.

Governments can, and often do, require businesses to display notices, just like the notices in <i>NIFLA<\/i>\u2014consider the warnings one sees on cigarette packs[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a0104550 (2025) (describing requirements for cigar labeling).[\/footnote] and pesticide bottles,[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 3, \u00a7\u00a06678 (2025) (describing requirements for service container labeling).[\/footnote] or the signs one might see in a grocery store or doctor\u2019s office.[footnote]See, e.g., N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law \u00a7\u00a0214-m (McKinney 2025) (requiring labeling for certain food products).[\/footnote]Governments can, and also often do, seek to protect their citizens from discrimination, just like Colorado tried to do with its antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020) (\u201cAn employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\u201d); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 677 (2015)(\u201cThe dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.\u201d);<i> <\/i>John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review 74 (1980) (noting that, according to some scholars, the \u201ctwo broad concerns of the Warren Court\u2014with clearing the channels of political change on the one hand, and with correcting certain kinds of discrimination against minorities on the other\u2014fit together to form a coherent theory of representative government\u201d).[\/footnote] Many object to both sorts of laws. No one thinks Philip Morris wants to tell its customers that smoking kills on each pack of Marlboros that they buy. And our shared history unfortunately makes clear that many businesses would freely discriminate based on race, sex, or sexual orientation if the law did not make it illegal for them to do so.[footnote]See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 243 (1964) (\u201cPrior to passage of the Act the motel had followed a practice of refusing to rent rooms to Negroes, and it alleged that it intended to continue to do so. In an effort to perpetuate that policy this suit was filed.\u201d).[\/footnote] But the law does make it illegal, and it usually doesn\u2019t give out a pass to those who do not want to comply.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative<\/i>, however, the Court broke from that general rule and explicitly invoked freedom of thought as a basis for doing so. Although the Court claimed<i> <\/i>it was only protecting religious thought, the practical effect of its holding was to insulate religious action, even when such action contravenes other important legal obligations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Nor are <i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative<\/i> one-off decisions. To the contrary, they should be conceived as part of a broader set of recent cases that have tested the boundaries of what a robust religious free thought doctrine could potentially encompass. Other examples, currently being litigated in the lower courts, abound. \u201cReligious\u201d hospitals, for instance, have started denying reproductive health services and treatments.[footnote]Frances Stead Sellers &amp; Meena Venkataramanan, Spread of Catholic Hospitals Limits Reproductive Care Across the U.S., Wash.

And post-<i>Reynolds<\/i>, the Court developed three important tools to cabin religious practices without unduly infringing on religious thought.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>First<\/i>, the Court has considered the government purpose behind a law. In <i>Employment Division v. Smith<\/i>, for instance, the Court upheld an Oregon law banning peyote, even though the law incidentally burdened the religious practices of Native American plaintiffs.[footnote]494 U.S. 872, 890 (1990) (\u201cBecause respondents\u2019 ingestion of peyote was prohibited under Oregon law, and because that prohibition is constitutional, Oregon may, consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment compensation when their dismissal results from use of the drug.\u201d).[\/footnote] As the Court in <i>Smith<\/i> explained, \u201cThe free exercise of religion\u201d includes both \u201cthe right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires\u201d and \u201cthe performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 877.[\/footnote] \u201c[T]he First Amendment obviously excludes all \u2018governmental regulation of religious beliefs\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403 (1963)).[\/footnote] And it bars governmental actors from passing laws with the purpose of burdening religion.[footnote]Id. (explaining that the First Amendment prohibits government from compelling affirmation of religious belief, punishing the expression of religious doctrine, imposing social disabilities based on religious views, and lending its power to a particular side in a religious controversy).[\/footnote] But echoing <i>Reynolds<\/i>, the <i>Smith <\/i>Court<i> <\/i>underscored that neither the Constitution nor any other law gives plaintiffs a right to challenge \u201ca generally applicable and otherwise valid provision\u201d just because that provision might have an \u201cincidental effect\u201d on a religious practice.[footnote]Id. at 878.[\/footnote] To emphasize the point, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, explained that \u201c[w]e have never held that an individual\u2019s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 878\u201379.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>Second<\/i>, the Court has looked to whether a religious carve-out would cause third-party harm. In <i>United States v. Lee<\/i>, it rejected an Amish employer\u2019s challenge to paying social security taxes.[footnote]455 U.S. 252, 254\u201355 (1982).[\/footnote] As Justice John Paul Stevens observed in his concurring opinion, Congress had already \u201cgranted the Amish a limited exemption from social security taxes\u201d by allowing self-employed Amish people the choice of opting out if they could prove a sincere religious objection.[footnote]Id. at 262 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote] He added, \u201c[I]t would [have] be[en] a relatively simple matter to extend the exemption\u201d by excluding both self-employed Amish (which the statute already exempted) and Amish employers (which would have required the Court to recognize an additional exemption) from having to pay social security taxes.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Doing so might have even \u201cbenefit[ted] the social security system because the nonpayment of these taxes by the Amish would be more than offset by the elimination of their right to collect benefits.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] But the Court declined to create a judicial carve-out on top of the statutory carve-out that Congress had already provided. Were it to open that door, \u201cit would be difficult to accommodate [a] comprehensive social security system with myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d\u2014a clear nod to the harm that other, non-religious parties would suffer.[footnote]Id. at 259\u201360 (majority opinion).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In addition to the sorts of financial harms in <i>Lee<\/i>, the Court has also refused to allow groups to impose dignitary harms on others in the name of religion. When, in <i>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises<\/i>, several restaurants refused to serve Black customers, claiming that the Civil Rights Act \u201cwas invalid because it \u2018contravene[d] the will of God\u2019 and constitute[d] an interference with the \u2018free exercise of [their] religion,\u2019\u201d the Court dismissed the defense as \u201cpatently frivolous.\u201d[footnote]390 U.S. 400, 402 n.5 (1968) (per curiam) (quoting Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 377 F.2d 433, 438 (4th Cir. 1967) (Winter, J., concurring specially)).[\/footnote] And when, in <i>Bob Jones University v. United States<\/i>, racially discriminatory schools challenged the government\u2019s decision to revoke their tax-exempt status on the grounds that their religion required them to discriminate on the basis of race, the Court repudiated that effort, too.[footnote]461 U.S. 574, 604 (1983).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>Third<\/i>, the Court has looked to the plaintiffs\u2019 sincerity to ensure that any special treatment for religion is afforded only to the true believer, rather than the make-believer. During the 1950s and \u201960s, judges carefully examined whether a plaintiff\u2019s religious convictions were genuine and required respecting not only religious thought but also religious action.[footnote]See, e.g., Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382\u201383 (1955) (scrutinizing the sincerity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged religious objections to war).[\/footnote] To undertake that analysis, courts often asked plaintiffs to produce significant and voluminous evidence showing internal consistency of belief and practice.[footnote]See id.

But they have each fallen into disrepair.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Start with purpose. Despite a seemingly unending supply of literature criticizing <i>Smith<\/i>,[footnote]See, e.g., Blaine L. Hutchison, Revisiting<i> Employment Division v. Smith<\/i>, 91 U. Cin. L. Rev. 396, 399 (2022) (\u201cThe problem is <i>Smith<\/i>. <i>Smith<\/i> does not protect religious liberty or prevent religious persecution and conflict.\u201d); see also Allan Ides, The Text of the Free Exercise Clause as a Measure of<i>Employment Division v.

Ryan, <i>Smith <\/i>and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act: An Iconoclastic Assessment, 78 Va. L. Rev. 1407, 1409 n.15 (1992) (listing law review articles critical of <i>Smith<\/i>).[\/footnote] the Court has declined to overrule the case.[footnote]See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 n.1 (2022) (\u201c[W]hile the [<i>Smith<\/i>] test we do apply today has been the subject of some criticism,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. we have no need to engage with that debate today because no party has asked us to do so.\u201d).[\/footnote] As a formal legal matter, generally applicable laws today remain insulated from legal challenge, while those targeting religion do not.[footnote]On this issue, Professor Adam Winkler\u2019s research has been particularly instructive. In 2006, Winkler published a study examining every federal district and circuit court decision raising a religious liberty claim in the fifteen years after <i>Smith. <\/i>Adam Winkler, Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time\u2014i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-<i>Smith<\/i>, having little problem actually applying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion.[\/footnote] What the Court <i>has<\/i> done, though, is redraw the lines of engagement so that only a vanishingly small number of laws are now considered generally applicable, and laws that have nothing to do with religion are categorized as targeting religious belief or practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia<\/i>, for example, Catholic Social Services (CSS) refused to comply with Philadelphia\u2019s foster care contract, which required prospective foster care\u2013placement organizations to certify that they would not discriminate based on protected characteristics.[footnote]141 S. Ct. 1868, 1874 (2021).[\/footnote] CSS objected, citing its belief that marriage was meant to be between a man and a woman.[footnote]Id. at 1875.[\/footnote] Like the peyote ban in <i>Smith<\/i>, there is little evidence that the city intended, through its antidiscrimination provision, to single out or target religion. But the Court nonetheless ruled in CSS\u2019s favor because a separate provision in the foster care contract contemplated an \u201cexception\u201d from this antidiscrimination requirement, to be granted at the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the City Commissioner.[footnote]Id. at 1878 (internal quotation marks omitted).[\/footnote] This provision, the Court opined, meant that the city\u2019s policy was not actually generally applicable, since the contract \u201cinvite[d]\u201d the government to consider the particular reasons for a person\u2019s conduct and \u201cdecide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1879 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990)).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Such a rule might at first glance seem innocuous. That is especially so because, were one only to read the <i>Fulton <\/i>majority opinion, one might easily have gotten the impression that the city was offering exemptions left and right to secular organizations, while declining them to religious ones. But that was not the case. The city, to be sure, had \u201cno intention of handing\u201d an exception to CSS.[footnote]Id. at 1887 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote] Yet it had also \u201c<i>never <\/i>granted such an exemption\u201d to anyone\u2014religious or secular.[footnote]Id. (emphasis added) (citing Brief for City Respondents at 36, <i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. (No. 19-123), 2020 WL 4819956).[\/footnote] No matter. What counted for the Court was that an exemption was <i>theoretically<\/i> possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">That feature, however, characterizes most laws. The pardon power, for example, creates an implicit exception to every criminal law.[footnote]See Michael A. Foster, Cong. Rsch.

If it was, there would have been no issue in <i>Lee <\/i>with granting a tax exemption to the single objecting plaintiff that brought the case, since doing so would have been a \u201crelatively simple\u201d administrative matter and maybe, as Justice Stevens pointed out, even good fiscal policy.[footnote]United States v.

Indeed, after <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, accommodation requests skyrocketed, which ultimately prompted the government to make the original, narrowly drawn church exemption available to <i>all<\/i> \u201cnon-governmental employers\u201d that might object either on \u201creligious\u201d or<i> <\/i>even just \u201cmoral\u201d grounds.[footnote]See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v.

Ct. at 1399 (\u201cThe [False Claims Act]\u2019s scienter element refers to respondents\u2019 knowledge and subjective beliefs\u2014not to what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed.\u201d).[\/footnote] Lower courts may not simply look to and rely on the objectively reasonable determination; <i>SuperValu<\/i> requires a close probe into the defendant\u2019s actual mindset.[footnote]See id. at 1404 (\u201cIf petitioners can make that showing, then it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable interpretation of \u2018usual and customary\u2019 would point to respondents\u2019 higher prices. For scienter, it is enough if respondents believed that their claims were not accurate.\u201d).[\/footnote] Neither <i>Ming Dai <\/i>nor <i>SuperValu<\/i> are, of course, exact matches to religious sincerity. But they both reflect a Court willing to look beyond the surface of an individual\u2019s purported beliefs, instead of approaching those beliefs in a \u201chands-off\u201d manner.[footnote]See Samuel J. Levine, Rethinking the Supreme Court\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Questions of Religious Practice and Belief, 25 Fordham Urb. L.J. 85, 92\u2013123 (1997) (tracing the development of the Court\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d approach to deciding questions of religious belief and sincerity in Free Exercise cases); Samuel J. Levine, The Supreme Court\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Religious Doctrine: An Introduction, 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 793, 795 (2009) (\u201c[T]he Court generally eschews decision-making that requires adjudication of religious doctrine.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Still, even if the Court were to course correct on its law and religion jurisprudence, that <i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative <\/i>came out the way they did prompts a final question: Should we, going forward, still think of and treat freedom of thought as an unbounded, fundamental right?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">It seems that, even if the government cannot necessarily tell people what to think, it can and does tell people what <i>it<\/i> thinks. And its message is often abundantly clear. The Civil Rights Act tells us not to discriminate because, as a democracy, we have collectively decided that doing so is both harmful and illegal. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells us to accommodate those with certain needs, for substantially the same reasons. So too does the government communicate a message with the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Endangered Species Act. All of us have the freedom to think what we want individually. But should any of our individual thoughts be able to, as a matter of right, override the thoughts and welfare of the collective whole?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Furthermore, whatever the freedom of thought is supposed to protect, it simply cannot give open license to an unfettered freedom of action. The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in <i>303 Creative <\/i>shows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.[footnote]303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S. Ct. 2298, 2310 (2023) (\u201cThe framers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to protect the \u2018freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.\u2019 They did so because they saw the freedom of speech \u2018both as an end and as a means.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted) (first quoting Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 660\u201361 (2000); then quoting Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring))).[\/footnote] And action can be speech when it is expressive;[footnote]See, e.g., Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410, 415 (1974) (per curiam) (holding that flying an American flag with a \u201cpeace symbol\u201d on it to be protected activity under the First Amendment).[\/footnote] so expressive conduct, even if it is nothing more than discrimination, gets a pass under antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See, e.g., <i>303 Creative<\/i>, 143 S. Ct. at 2310\u201316<i> <\/i>(concluding that creating wedding websites qualifies as \u201c\u2018pure speech\u2019 protected by the First Amendment,\u201d before holding that applying Colorado\u2019s antidiscrimination act to require creators to serve LGBTQ+ clients would be unconstitutional (quoting 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 6 F.4th 1160, 1176 (10th Cir. 2021), rev\u2019d, 143 S. Ct. 2298)).[\/footnote] It is not necessarily or readily apparent where this syllogism breaks down. But the result\u2014an all-too-robust freedom of thought\u2014cannot be squared with a rule of law that respects the dignity and rights of all persons. Figuring out how and where and in what way to intervene in this logical chain is a prerequisite to embracing a more expansive freedom of thought for all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

Though long venerated by scholars and judges,[footnote]See, e.g., Marc Jonathan Blitz, Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution, 2010 Wis. L. Rev. 1049, 1051 (describing how the Supreme Court and scholars view freedom of thought as broader than freedom of speech); Matthew B. Lawrence, Addiction and Liberty, 108 Cornell L. Rev. 259, 261 (2023) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly described \u2018freedom of thought\u2019 as a key aspect of the liberty that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to protect.\u201d); see also Jerome A. Barron, Access to the Press\u2013A New First Amendment Right, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1641, 1649 (1967) (\u201cJustice Cardozo clearly indicated that while many rights could be eliminated and yet \u2018justice\u2019 not undone, \u2018neither liberty nor justice would exist\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [without] freedom of thought and speech\u2019 since free expression is \u2018the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.\u2019\u201d (alterations in original) (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325\u201327 (1937))); Rafael Domingo, Restoring Freedom of Conscience, 30 J.L. &amp; Religion 176, 176 (2015) (\u201cFreedom of thought is required for the human person as a rational being\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Charles Fried, Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice, 78 B.U. L. Rev. 717, 723\u201324 (1998) (\u201cBy speaking of freedom of thought I wish to push to the fore exactly that which developed First Amendment doctrine\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. seeks to establish: that the state has no business seeking to control\u2014that is, to prohibit or command\u2014the minds of its citizens.\u201d); Jed Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737, 754 (1989) (\u201cThus, the freedom of self-definition would be the fundamental human right, of which, for example, the freedoms of thought and belief embodied in the first amendment would count as necessary but insufficient components.\u201d).[\/footnote] it was for many years the rare legal right searching for a legal wrong to redress.[footnote]See, e.g., Blitz, supra note 1, at 1051 (acknowledging that as \u201ccentral as freedom of thought is to our constitutional system,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the Supreme Court has never said exactly what this freedom is,\u201d and questioning whether \u201cfreedom of thought [can] stand on its own\u201d); Recent Case, <i>Doe v. City of Lafayette<\/i>,<i> <\/i>377 F.3d 757 (7th Cir. 2004) (en banc), 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1054, 1054 (2005) (\u201cNumerous Supreme Court decisions have proclaimed that the First Amendment protects freedom of mind or thought. These statements, however, have usually been dicta; only a few cases have actually been decided on freedom of thought grounds.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[\/footnote] True, free thought might have held \u201ca central place among our constitutional liberties.\u201d[footnote]Blitz, supra note 1, at 1051.[\/footnote] But many struggled to explain what it was supposed to protect that would not otherwise be covered by free speech, free exercise, or another fundamental right.[footnote]See, e.g., Adam J. Kobler, Two Views of First Amendment Thought Privacy, 18 U. Pa. J. Con. L. 1381, 1386\u201387 (2016) (\u201cOne important question that courts have never resolved is whether freedom of thought is only protected by the [First] Amendment in cases that implicate expression.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [so], there is nothing particularly special about freedom of thought from a free speech perspective.\u201d); Wayne Unger, Stay Out of My Head: Neurodata, Privacy, and the First Amendment, 80 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1439, 1494 (2023) (\u201cFirst Amendment liberties have a \u2018double aspect\u2019 in that the freedoms of speech, press, and religion are more fundamentally the freedoms of thought and action.\u201d (quoting Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584, 618 (1942) (Murphy, J., dissenting))).[\/footnote] Today, though, the ever-increasing encroachment of technology has turned freedom of thought into the go-to answer for any number of modern ills, from social media manipulation,[footnote]See Susie Alegre, We\u2019re Dangerously Close to Giving Big Tech Control of Our Thoughts, Time (June 29, 2022), https:\/\/time.com\/6191973\/big-tech-freedom-of-thought\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/D4MJ-69UG] (explaining that social media platforms can be \u201cpowerful tool[s] for manipulation\u201d).[\/footnote] to data harvesting,[footnote]See Jane Bambauer, Is Data Speech?, 66 Stan. L. Rev. 57, 64 (2014) (arguing that \u201cdata should receive speech protection any time it is regulated <i>as<\/i> information\u201d).[\/footnote] to substance abuse.[footnote]See Lawrence, supra note 1, at 263 (identifying a freedom from addiction as a fundamental liberty interest and explaining that \u201cthe right to freedom from addiction manifests as a legal tool to protect Americans\u2019 freedom of thought\u201d).[\/footnote] Even so, attendees of the free thought renaissance fair often skip over an important point: The Supreme Court has, over the last several years, in fact laid out what a more robust free thought doctrine might look like in practice. And that vision should give pause even to free thought\u2019s most ardent champions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2>I. <em>NIFLA<\/em> and <em>303 Creative<\/em><\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The Court has referred to the freedom of thought by name twice in the past decade. The first time was seven years ago in <i>National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra <\/i>(<i>NIFLA<\/i>).[footnote]138 S. Ct. 2361 (2018).[\/footnote] There, several crisis pregnancy centers[footnote]\u00a0 Crisis pregnancy centers are \u201cfacilities that represent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion.\u201d Am. Coll. of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, Issue Brief: Crisis Pregnancy Centers 1 (2020), https:\/\/www.acog.org\/-\/media\/project\/acog\/acogorg\/files\/advocacy\/issue-briefs\/crisis-pregnancy-centers.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/5NDQ-EYL3]. They are often operated by nonmedical personnel. Id.[\/footnote] challenged a California law requiring them to post notices about the availability of \u201clow-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2369 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a0123472(a)(1) (2016)).[\/footnote] According to a study the legislature commissioned to aid it in drafting the legislation, most crisis pregnancy centers were \u201cpro-life\u201d organizations whose \u201caim [was] to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2368 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Casey Watters, Meg Keaney &amp; Natalie Evans, Pub. L. Rsrch. Inst., Pregnancy Resource Centers: Ensuring Access and Accuracy of Information 4 (2011)).[\/footnote] The notice requirement sought to ensure that pregnant women were aware of all available reproductive services, not just the limited range offered by the centers.[footnote]Id. at 2369.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The centers saw the issue differently. They objected to \u201cprovid[ing] a government-drafted script about the availability of state-sponsored services,\u201d including \u201cabortion\u2014the very practice\u201d they were \u201cdevoted to opposing.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2371.[\/footnote] The Court agreed, and held that the notice likely constituted an impermissible regulation of speech.[footnote]Id. at 2378.[\/footnote] Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a concurrence joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, went a step further and invoked freedom of thought as a basis behind his decision: \u201cGovernments,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cmust not be allowed to force persons to express a message contrary to their deepest convictions.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2379 (Kennedy, J., concurring).[\/footnote] That is because the \u201c[f]reedom of speech secures freedom of thought and belief,\u201d and California\u2019s \u201claw imperils those liberties.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The next (and, at the time of this writing, most recent) occasion in which the Court discussed freedom of thought was <i>303 Creative LLC<\/i> <i>v. Elenis<\/i>.[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2298 (2023).[\/footnote]<i> <\/i>In that case, plaintiff Lorie Smith refused to design wedding webpages for same-sex couples because doing so purportedly offended \u201c[h]er belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2309 (citing Appendix to Petition for a Writ of Certiorari at 179a, 143 S. Ct. 2298 (No. 21-476),\u00a0 2021 WL 4459045).[\/footnote] The Court sided with Smith, holding a Colorado antidiscrimination law unconstitutional as applied to her.[footnote]Id. at 2321\u201322.[\/footnote] In so doing, the Court\u2019s majority opinion, written by Justice Gorsuch, returned to and expounded upon the themes Justice Kennedy articulated in <i>NIFLA<\/i>. Justice Gorsuch emphasized that the \u201cframers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to protect the \u2018freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2310 (quoting Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 660\u201361 (2000)).[\/footnote] \u201c[T]he freedom to think and speak,\u201d he stressed, \u201cis among our inalienable human rights,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2311.[\/footnote] and \u201cthe opportunity to think for ourselves and to express those thoughts freely is among our most cherished liberties and part of what keeps our Republic strong.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2321.[\/footnote] Colorado \u201cseeks to deny that promise\u201d to its citizens by forcing them to speak in a manner that contravenes their religious beliefs.[footnote]Id. at 2322.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative<\/i> both involved the intersection of free thought and religious exercise. That fact alone is not particularly surprising, as thought and religion have long been intertwined.[footnote]See, e.g., United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944) (\u201cFreedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.\u201d (citing W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943))); Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584, 618 (1942) (Murphy, J., dissenting) (\u201cFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion all have a double aspect\u2014freedom of thought and freedom of action.\u201d); Laurence H. Tribe &amp; Michael C. Dorf, Levels of Generality in the Definition of Rights, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1057, 1069 (1990) (explaining \u201cJustice Harlan\u2019s point was that the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and so forth make sense only if connected by a broader and underlying principle of freedom of thought and conscience\u201d).[\/footnote] What is remarkable, though, is <i>how<\/i> the Court connected these two concepts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">To see why, consider the types of laws at issue in these cases. Governments can, and often do, require businesses to display notices, just like the notices in <i>NIFLA<\/i>\u2014consider the warnings one sees on cigarette packs[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a0104550 (2025) (describing requirements for cigar labeling).[\/footnote] and pesticide bottles,[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 3, \u00a7\u00a06678 (2025) (describing requirements for service container labeling).[\/footnote] or the signs one might see in a grocery store or doctor\u2019s office.[footnote]See, e.g., N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law \u00a7\u00a0214-m (McKinney 2025) (requiring labeling for certain food products).[\/footnote]Governments can, and also often do, seek to protect their citizens from discrimination, just like Colorado tried to do with its antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S.

In <i>United States v.

Were it to open that door, \u201cit would be difficult to accommodate [a] comprehensive social security system with myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d\u2014a clear nod to the harm that other, non-religious parties would suffer.[footnote]Id. at 259\u201360 (majority opinion).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In addition to the sorts of financial harms in <i>Lee<\/i>, the Court has also refused to allow groups to impose dignitary harms on others in the name of religion.

During the 1950s and \u201960s, judges carefully examined whether a plaintiff\u2019s religious convictions were genuine and required respecting not only religious thought but also religious action.[footnote]See, e.g., Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382\u201383 (1955) (scrutinizing the sincerity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged religious objections to war).[\/footnote] To undertake that analysis, courts often asked plaintiffs to produce significant and voluminous evidence showing internal consistency of belief and practice.[footnote]See id.

Despite a seemingly unending supply of literature criticizing <i>Smith<\/i>,[footnote]See, e.g., Blaine L. Hutchison, Revisiting<i> Employment Division v. Smith<\/i>, 91 U. Cin. L. Rev. 396, 399 (2022) (\u201cThe problem is <i>Smith<\/i>. <i>Smith<\/i> does not protect religious liberty or prevent religious persecution and conflict.\u201d); see also Allan Ides, The Text of the Free Exercise Clause as a Measure of<i>Employment Division v.

Rev. 1407, 1409 n.15 (1992) (listing law review articles critical of <i>Smith<\/i>).[\/footnote] the Court has declined to overrule the case.[footnote]See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 n.1 (2022) (\u201c[W]hile the [<i>Smith<\/i>] test we do apply today has been the subject of some criticism,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. we have no need to engage with that debate today because no party has asked us to do so.\u201d).[\/footnote] As a formal legal matter, generally applicable laws today remain insulated from legal challenge, while those targeting religion do not.[footnote]On this issue, Professor Adam Winkler\u2019s research has been particularly instructive. In 2006, Winkler published a study examining every federal district and circuit court decision raising a religious liberty claim in the fifteen years after <i>Smith. <\/i>Adam Winkler, Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time\u2014i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-<i>Smith<\/i>, having little problem actually applying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion.[\/footnote] What the Court <i>has<\/i> done, though, is redraw the lines of engagement so that only a vanishingly small number of laws are now considered generally applicable, and laws that have nothing to do with religion are categorized as targeting religious belief or practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia<\/i>, for example, Catholic Social Services (CSS) refused to comply with Philadelphia\u2019s foster care contract, which required prospective foster care\u2013placement organizations to certify that they would not discriminate based on protected characteristics.[footnote]141 S. Ct. 1868, 1874 (2021).[\/footnote] CSS objected, citing its belief that marriage was meant to be between a man and a woman.[footnote]Id. at 1875.[\/footnote] Like the peyote ban in <i>Smith<\/i>, there is little evidence that the city intended, through its antidiscrimination provision, to single out or target religion. But the Court nonetheless ruled in CSS\u2019s favor because a separate provision in the foster care contract contemplated an \u201cexception\u201d from this antidiscrimination requirement, to be granted at the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the City Commissioner.[footnote]Id. at 1878 (internal quotation marks omitted).[\/footnote] This provision, the Court opined, meant that the city\u2019s policy was not actually generally applicable, since the contract \u201cinvite[d]\u201d the government to consider the particular reasons for a person\u2019s conduct and \u201cdecide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1879 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990)).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Such a rule might at first glance seem innocuous. That is especially so because, were one only to read the <i>Fulton <\/i>majority opinion, one might easily have gotten the impression that the city was offering exemptions left and right to secular organizations, while declining them to religious ones. But that was not the case. The city, to be sure, had \u201cno intention of handing\u201d an exception to CSS.[footnote]Id. at 1887 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote] Yet it had also \u201c<i>never <\/i>granted such an exemption\u201d to anyone\u2014religious or secular.[footnote]Id. (emphasis added) (citing Brief for City Respondents at 36, <i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. (No. 19-123), 2020 WL 4819956).[\/footnote] No matter. What counted for the Court was that an exemption was <i>theoretically<\/i> possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">That feature, however, characterizes most laws. The pardon power, for example, creates an implicit exception to every criminal law.[footnote]See Michael A. Foster, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46179, Presidential Pardons: Overview and Selected Legal Issues 6 (2020) (\u201cThe federal courts have recognized that the power conferred by Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution is quite broad, establishing virtually \u2018unfettered executive discretion\u2019 to grant clemency.\u201d (quoting Hoffa v. Saxbe, 378 F. Supp. 1221, 1234 (D.D.C 1974))). As especially relevant here, many states vest the pardon power in the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the Governor or other Executive official, mirroring the \u201csole discretion\u201d language from Philadelphia\u2019s foster-care contract. See, e.g., Cal. Const. art. V, \u00a7\u00a08(a); Fla. Const. art. IV, \u00a7\u00a08(a).[\/footnote]Executive discretion recognizes a similar exception to federal immigration law.[footnote]Holly Straut-Eppsteiner, Cong. Rsch. Serv., IF12424, Immigration 101: Executive Branch Agencies Involved With Immigration 1 (2023) (\u201cWhile Congress has plenary power over immigration law, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Homeland Security Act (HSA), and other laws grant substantial discretion over immigration policy to the executive branch. Executive branch departments and their components have distinct yet overlapping responsibilities for immigration policy.\u201d). Indeed, even an individual that has been ordered removed can remain in the country pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01229b (2018) (providing for situations in which the Attorney General may cancel removal); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01182(h) (providing the Attorney General with discretion to grant waivers for certain grounds of inadmissibility).[\/footnote] And many environmental laws explicitly contemplate the granting of individualized waivers or exemptions.[footnote]Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency can grant waivers to states for specific emissions standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(b)(3) (2018).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">To grasp the mess that <i>Fulton <\/i>made, consider that a secular plaintiff would obviously not receive heightened review if they were to challenge any of the above laws.[footnote]The central purpose of rational basis review is to head off such challenges. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 15 (1992) (holding that equal protection \u201cdoes not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification\u201d (citing U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980))).[\/footnote] But if someone commits a crime and claims they did so for religious reasons, the government must prove\u2014at least if <i>Fulton<\/i> is to be taken seriously\u2014not only that it \u201chas a compelling interest in enforcing\u201d the law generally but also \u201can interest in denying an exception\u201d to a particular plaintiff.[footnote]<i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. at 1181.[\/footnote] The same would hold true if an individual or organization claimed a religious right to pollute. These sorts of scenarios go beyond merely modifying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. They gut it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Third-party harm follows a similar path, with the Court\u2019s approach to the contraceptive mandate offering a particularly instructive example. That mandate, a part of the Affordable Care Act, was meant to \u201cserve[] the Government\u2019s compelling interest in providing insurance coverage\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary to protect the health of female employees.\u201d[footnote]Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 737 (2014) (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also id. at 728 (majority opinion) (\u201cWe will assume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] As initially drafted, compliance was mandatory for nearly everyone, with a very narrow exception for churches that might object to the mandate on religious grounds.[footnote]Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2387\u201388 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring).[\/footnote] Almost immediately after that exemption went into effect, though, many other organizations complained, arguing that the exemption \u201cfurnished insufficient protection for\u201d their religious exercise (even if they were not, as a formal matter, in the religion business).[footnote]Id. at 2388.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These issues came to a head in <i>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.<\/i>, when a for-profit crafts company challenged the government\u2019s decision to limit its religious exemption to churches and their auxiliaries.[footnote]573 U.S. at 689\u201391.[\/footnote] Hobby Lobby did not argue that it was a church, a church-related organization, or even that its employees were all members of the same church or had the same views on contraception.[footnote]Id. at 700\u201304.[\/footnote] It instead insisted that, as a closely held corporation, its sincere beliefs should override the government\u2019s judgment regarding the availability and provisioning of reproductive health services.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The Court agreed.[footnote]See id. at 689\u201391 (holding that \u201cregulations that impose [an] obligation\u201d on \u201cclosely held corporations [to] provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies\u2019 owners\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. violate RFRA\u201d).[\/footnote] And by ruling in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor, the Court effectively required the government to extend an exemption to the contraceptive mandate to virtually any employer\u2014religious or secular, for-profit or nonprofit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court both under- and over-read <i>United States v. Lee<\/i>, the Amish taxpayer exemption case. It under-read <i>Lee <\/i>because, according to <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, courts should \u201cscrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants\u201d when evaluating third-party harm.[footnote]Id. at 726\u201327 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gonzales<i> <\/i>v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006)).[\/footnote] But that is not how <i>Lee <\/i>thought about harm.

And its message is often abundantly clear. The Civil Rights Act tells us not to discriminate because, as a democracy, we have collectively decided that doing so is both harmful and illegal. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells us to accommodate those with certain needs, for substantially the same reasons. So too does the government communicate a message with the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Endangered Species Act. All of us have the freedom to think what we want individually. But should any of our individual thoughts be able to, as a matter of right, override the thoughts and welfare of the collective whole?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Furthermore, whatever the freedom of thought is supposed to protect, it simply cannot give open license to an unfettered freedom of action. The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in <i>303 Creative <\/i>shows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.[footnote]303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S.

That fact alone is not particularly surprising, as thought and religion have long been intertwined.[footnote]See, e.g., United States v.

Governments can, and often do, require businesses to display notices, just like the notices in <i>NIFLA<\/i>\u2014consider the warnings one sees on cigarette packs[footnote]See, e.g., Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a0104550 (2025) (describing requirements for cigar labeling).[\/footnote] and pesticide bottles,[footnote]See, e.g., Cal.

Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law \u00a7\u00a0214-m (McKinney 2025) (requiring labeling for certain food products).[\/footnote]Governments can, and also often do, seek to protect their citizens from discrimination, just like Colorado tried to do with its antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020) (\u201cAn employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\u201d); Obergefell v.

No one thinks Philip Morris wants to tell its customers that smoking kills on each pack of Marlboros that they buy. And our shared history unfortunately makes clear that many businesses would freely discriminate based on race, sex, or sexual orientation if the law did not make it illegal for them to do so.[footnote]See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 243 (1964) (\u201cPrior to passage of the Act the motel had followed a practice of refusing to rent rooms to Negroes, and it alleged that it intended to continue to do so. In an effort to perpetuate that policy this suit was filed.\u201d).[\/footnote] But the law does make it illegal, and it usually doesn\u2019t give out a pass to those who do not want to comply.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative<\/i>, however, the Court broke from that general rule and explicitly invoked freedom of thought as a basis for doing so.

To the contrary, they should be conceived as part of a broader set of recent cases that have tested the boundaries of what a robust religious free thought doctrine could potentially encompass.

(explaining that the First Amendment prohibits government from compelling affirmation of religious belief, punishing the expression of religious doctrine, imposing social disabilities based on religious views, and lending its power to a particular side in a religious controversy).[\/footnote] But echoing <i>Reynolds<\/i>, the <i>Smith <\/i>Court<i> <\/i>underscored that neither the Constitution nor any other law gives plaintiffs a right to challenge \u201ca generally applicable and otherwise valid provision\u201d just because that provision might have an \u201cincidental effect\u201d on a religious practice.[footnote]Id. at 878.[\/footnote] To emphasize the point, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, explained that \u201c[w]e have never held that an individual\u2019s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 878\u201379.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>Second<\/i>, the Court has looked to whether a religious carve-out would cause third-party harm. In <i>United States v.

Were it to open that door, \u201cit would be difficult to accommodate [a] comprehensive social security system with myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d\u2014a clear nod to the harm that other, non-religious parties would suffer.[footnote]Id. at 259\u201360 (majority opinion).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In addition to the sorts of financial harms in <i>Lee<\/i>, the Court has also refused to allow groups to impose dignitary harms on others in the name of religion.

During the 1950s and \u201960s, judges carefully examined whether a plaintiff\u2019s religious convictions were genuine and required respecting not only religious thought but also religious action.[footnote]See, e.g., Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382\u201383 (1955) (scrutinizing the sincerity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged religious objections to war).[\/footnote] To undertake that analysis, courts often asked plaintiffs to produce significant and voluminous evidence showing internal consistency of belief and practice.[footnote]See id.

But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-<i>Smith<\/i>, having little problem actually applying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion.[\/footnote] What the Court <i>has<\/i> done, though, is redraw the lines of engagement so that only a vanishingly small number of laws are now considered generally applicable, and laws that have nothing to do with religion are categorized as targeting religious belief or practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia<\/i>, for example, Catholic Social Services (CSS) refused to comply with Philadelphia\u2019s foster care contract, which required prospective foster care\u2013placement organizations to certify that they would not discriminate based on protected characteristics.[footnote]141 S. Ct. 1868, 1874 (2021).[\/footnote] CSS objected, citing its belief that marriage was meant to be between a man and a woman.[footnote]Id. at 1875.[\/footnote] Like the peyote ban in <i>Smith<\/i>, there is little evidence that the city intended, through its antidiscrimination provision, to single out or target religion. But the Court nonetheless ruled in CSS\u2019s favor because a separate provision in the foster care contract contemplated an \u201cexception\u201d from this antidiscrimination requirement, to be granted at the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the City Commissioner.[footnote]Id. at 1878 (internal quotation marks omitted).[\/footnote] This provision, the Court opined, meant that the city\u2019s policy was not actually generally applicable, since the contract \u201cinvite[d]\u201d the government to consider the particular reasons for a person\u2019s conduct and \u201cdecide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1879 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990)).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Such a rule might at first glance seem innocuous. That is especially so because, were one only to read the <i>Fulton <\/i>majority opinion, one might easily have gotten the impression that the city was offering exemptions left and right to secular organizations, while declining them to religious ones. But that was not the case. The city, to be sure, had \u201cno intention of handing\u201d an exception to CSS.[footnote]Id. at 1887 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote] Yet it had also \u201c<i>never <\/i>granted such an exemption\u201d to anyone\u2014religious or secular.[footnote]Id. (emphasis added) (citing Brief for City Respondents at 36, <i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. (No. 19-123), 2020 WL 4819956).[\/footnote] No matter. What counted for the Court was that an exemption was <i>theoretically<\/i> possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">That feature, however, characterizes most laws. The pardon power, for example, creates an implicit exception to every criminal law.[footnote]See Michael A. Foster, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46179, Presidential Pardons: Overview and Selected Legal Issues 6 (2020) (\u201cThe federal courts have recognized that the power conferred by Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution is quite broad, establishing virtually \u2018unfettered executive discretion\u2019 to grant clemency.\u201d (quoting Hoffa v. Saxbe, 378 F. Supp. 1221, 1234 (D.D.C 1974))). As especially relevant here, many states vest the pardon power in the \u201csole discretion\u201d of the Governor or other Executive official, mirroring the \u201csole discretion\u201d language from Philadelphia\u2019s foster-care contract. See, e.g., Cal. Const. art. V, \u00a7\u00a08(a); Fla. Const. art. IV, \u00a7\u00a08(a).[\/footnote]Executive discretion recognizes a similar exception to federal immigration law.[footnote]Holly Straut-Eppsteiner, Cong. Rsch. Serv., IF12424, Immigration 101: Executive Branch Agencies Involved With Immigration 1 (2023) (\u201cWhile Congress has plenary power over immigration law, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Homeland Security Act (HSA), and other laws grant substantial discretion over immigration policy to the executive branch. Executive branch departments and their components have distinct yet overlapping responsibilities for immigration policy.\u201d). Indeed, even an individual that has been ordered removed can remain in the country pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01229b (2018) (providing for situations in which the Attorney General may cancel removal); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01182(h) (providing the Attorney General with discretion to grant waivers for certain grounds of inadmissibility).[\/footnote] And many environmental laws explicitly contemplate the granting of individualized waivers or exemptions.[footnote]Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency can grant waivers to states for specific emissions standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(b)(3) (2018).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">To grasp the mess that <i>Fulton <\/i>made, consider that a secular plaintiff would obviously not receive heightened review if they were to challenge any of the above laws.[footnote]The central purpose of rational basis review is to head off such challenges. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 15 (1992) (holding that equal protection \u201cdoes not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification\u201d (citing U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980))).[\/footnote] But if someone commits a crime and claims they did so for religious reasons, the government must prove\u2014at least if <i>Fulton<\/i> is to be taken seriously\u2014not only that it \u201chas a compelling interest in enforcing\u201d the law generally but also \u201can interest in denying an exception\u201d to a particular plaintiff.[footnote]<i>Fulton<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. at 1181.[\/footnote] The same would hold true if an individual or organization claimed a religious right to pollute. These sorts of scenarios go beyond merely modifying <i>Smith<\/i>\u2019s framework. They gut it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Third-party harm follows a similar path, with the Court\u2019s approach to the contraceptive mandate offering a particularly instructive example. That mandate, a part of the Affordable Care Act, was meant to \u201cserve[] the Government\u2019s compelling interest in providing insurance coverage\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary to protect the health of female employees.\u201d[footnote]Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 737 (2014) (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also id. at 728 (majority opinion) (\u201cWe will assume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] As initially drafted, compliance was mandatory for nearly everyone, with a very narrow exception for churches that might object to the mandate on religious grounds.[footnote]Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2387\u201388 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring).[\/footnote] Almost immediately after that exemption went into effect, though, many other organizations complained, arguing that the exemption \u201cfurnished insufficient protection for\u201d their religious exercise (even if they were not, as a formal matter, in the religion business).[footnote]Id. at 2388.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These issues came to a head in <i>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.<\/i>, when a for-profit crafts company challenged the government\u2019s decision to limit its religious exemption to churches and their auxiliaries.[footnote]573 U.S. at 689\u201391.[\/footnote] Hobby Lobby did not argue that it was a church, a church-related organization, or even that its employees were all members of the same church or had the same views on contraception.[footnote]Id. at 700\u201304.[\/footnote] It instead insisted that, as a closely held corporation, its sincere beliefs should override the government\u2019s judgment regarding the availability and provisioning of reproductive health services.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The Court agreed.[footnote]See id. at 689\u201391 (holding that \u201cregulations that impose [an] obligation\u201d on \u201cclosely held corporations [to] provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies\u2019 owners\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. violate RFRA\u201d).[\/footnote] And by ruling in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor, the Court effectively required the government to extend an exemption to the contraceptive mandate to virtually any employer\u2014religious or secular, for-profit or nonprofit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court both under- and over-read <i>United States v. Lee<\/i>, the Amish taxpayer exemption case. It under-read <i>Lee <\/i>because, according to <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, courts should \u201cscrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants\u201d when evaluating third-party harm.[footnote]Id. at 726\u201327 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gonzales<i> <\/i>v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006)).[\/footnote] But that is not how <i>Lee <\/i>thought about harm. If it was, there would have been no issue in <i>Lee <\/i>with granting a tax exemption to the single objecting plaintiff that brought the case, since doing so would have been a \u201crelatively simple\u201d administrative matter and maybe, as Justice Stevens pointed out, even good fiscal policy.[footnote]United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 262 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).[\/footnote]Instead, <i>Lee <\/i>considered the harm that would result if <i>others<\/i> began seeking and obtaining a free pass from paying Social Security taxes.[footnote]See id. at 258\u201360 (majority opinion) (discussing the government\u2019s strong \u201cinterest in assuring mandatory and continuous participation in and contribution to\u201d the country\u2019s \u201cnationwide\u201d social security system and describing how \u201cdifficult [it would be] to accommodate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs\u201d).[\/footnote] That scenario, of one exemption leading to many, stands in stark contrast to the constrained assessment of the marginal benefits and costs of granting a one-off exemption in <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>.[footnote]See <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, 573 U.S. at 721\u201326 (discussing the costs of an exemption to the ACA).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\"><i>Hobby Lobby <\/i>also over-read <i>Lee <\/i>because it characterized the case as a challenge to the entire tax system.[footnote]See id. at 734 (\u201cOur holding in <i>Lee<\/i> turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation.\u201d).[\/footnote] Such a characterization had the benefit of making the <i>Hobby Lobby <\/i>plaintiffs seem more reasonable, since they were only seeking to excuse themselves from one part of the \u201cACA\u2019s comprehensive scheme.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 735.[\/footnote] But that characterization was incorrect. <i>Lee <\/i>did not involve a wholesale attack on the tax system. The plaintiff objected only to paying social security taxes, not all state or federal taxes.[footnote]<i>Lee<\/i>, 455 U.S. at 255 (describing the Amish community as \u201creligiously opposed to the national social security system\u201d specifically because \u201cthe Amish believe it sinful not to provide for their own elderly and needy\u201d).[\/footnote] It was the Court which inferred that a successful challenge for one employer on one form of taxation would inevitably lead to challenges by other employers to other forms of taxation.[footnote]See id. at 260 (arguing that \u201c[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief\u201d).[\/footnote] <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i> declined to undertake such an analysis; the Court insisted on looking at the facts of the singular plaintiff, rather than considering whether its ruling would lead to a dramatic rise in exemption requests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The practical effect of <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>\u2019s under- and over-reading of <i>Lee <\/i>is to minimize consideration of third-party harm in law and religion cases. Indeed, after <i>Hobby Lobby<\/i>, accommodation requests skyrocketed, which ultimately prompted the government to make the original, narrowly drawn church exemption available to <i>all<\/i> \u201cnon-governmental employers\u201d that might object either on \u201creligious\u201d or<i> <\/i>even just \u201cmoral\u201d grounds.[footnote]See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v.

That is discrimination and, in Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s words, it is \u201charm.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] There\u2019s no need to look any further than that.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">There is even reason for hope on sincerity. In <i>Garland v. Ming Dai<\/i>[footnote]\u00a0 141 S. Ct. 1669 (2021).[\/footnote] and <i>United States ex rel. Schutte v. SuperValu Inc.<\/i>,[footnote]\u00a0 143 S. Ct. 1391 (2023).[\/footnote] the Court reversed lower courts on credibility questions. In the former case, the Court held that a court of appeals may not presume that an immigrant\u2019s testimony is credible.[footnote]<i>Ming Dai<\/i>, 141 S. Ct. at 1681 (\u201cThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s deemed-true-or-credible rule cannot be reconciled with the [Immigration and Nationality Act]\u2019s terms.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]he court of appeals must accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact as \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote] Instead, an immigration judge must make an explicit credibility determination\u2014akin to a sincerity determination\u2014based on a careful reading of the facts and the law.[footnote]Id. (explaining that, in immigration cases like the one at bar, \u201cthe factfinder\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [must] make[] findings of fact, including determinations as to the credibility of particular witness testimony\u201d).[\/footnote]Only then, once a determination is made on the record, can an appellate court invoke deferential review.[footnote]Id. (\u201cThe [Board of Immigration Appeals]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. reviews th[e] findings, applying a presumption of credibility if the [fact-finder] did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination. Finally, the court of appeals must accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact as \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote] <i>SuperValu<\/i> held that, in evaluating whether a defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d made false claims, the finder of fact can and should scrutinize a defendant\u2019s subjective understanding and intent.[footnote]<i>SuperValu<\/i>, 143 S. Ct. at 1399 (\u201cThe [False Claims Act]\u2019s scienter element refers to respondents\u2019 knowledge and subjective beliefs\u2014not to what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed.\u201d).[\/footnote] Lower courts may not simply look to and rely on the objectively reasonable determination; <i>SuperValu<\/i> requires a close probe into the defendant\u2019s actual mindset.[footnote]See id. at 1404 (\u201cIf petitioners can make that showing, then it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable interpretation of \u2018usual and customary\u2019 would point to respondents\u2019 higher prices. For scienter, it is enough if respondents believed that their claims were not accurate.\u201d).[\/footnote] Neither <i>Ming Dai <\/i>nor <i>SuperValu<\/i> are, of course, exact matches to religious sincerity. But they both reflect a Court willing to look beyond the surface of an individual\u2019s purported beliefs, instead of approaching those beliefs in a \u201chands-off\u201d manner.[footnote]See Samuel J. Levine, Rethinking the Supreme Court\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Questions of Religious Practice and Belief, 25 Fordham Urb. L.J. 85, 92\u2013123 (1997) (tracing the development of the Court\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d approach to deciding questions of religious belief and sincerity in Free Exercise cases); Samuel J. Levine, The Supreme Court\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Religious Doctrine: An Introduction, 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 793, 795 (2009) (\u201c[T]he Court generally eschews decision-making that requires adjudication of religious doctrine.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Still, even if the Court were to course correct on its law and religion jurisprudence, that <i>NIFLA <\/i>and <i>303 Creative <\/i>came out the way they did prompts a final question: Should we, going forward, still think of and treat freedom of thought as an unbounded, fundamental right?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">It seems that, even if the government cannot necessarily tell people what to think, it can and does tell people what <i>it<\/i> thinks. And its message is often abundantly clear. The Civil Rights Act tells us not to discriminate because, as a democracy, we have collectively decided that doing so is both harmful and illegal. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells us to accommodate those with certain needs, for substantially the same reasons. So too does the government communicate a message with the Clean Air and Water Acts, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Endangered Species Act. All of us have the freedom to think what we want individually. But should any of our individual thoughts be able to, as a matter of right, override the thoughts and welfare of the collective whole?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Furthermore, whatever the freedom of thought is supposed to protect, it simply cannot give open license to an unfettered freedom of action. The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in <i>303 Creative <\/i>shows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.[footnote]303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S. Ct. 2298, 2310 (2023) (\u201cThe framers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to protect the \u2018freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.\u2019 They did so because they saw the freedom of speech \u2018both as an end and as a means.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted) (first quoting Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 660\u201361 (2000); then quoting Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring))).[\/footnote] And action can be speech when it is expressive;[footnote]See, e.g., Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410, 415 (1974) (per curiam) (holding that flying an American flag with a \u201cpeace symbol\u201d on it to be protected activity under the First Amendment).[\/footnote] so expressive conduct, even if it is nothing more than discrimination, gets a pass under antidiscrimination law.[footnote]See, e.g., <i>303 Creative<\/i>, 143 S. Ct. at 2310\u201316<i> <\/i>(concluding that creating wedding websites qualifies as \u201c\u2018pure speech\u2019 protected by the First Amendment,\u201d before holding that applying Colorado\u2019s antidiscrimination act to require creators to serve LGBTQ+ clients would be unconstitutional (quoting 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 6 F.4th 1160, 1176 (10th Cir. 2021), rev\u2019d, 143 S. Ct. 2298)).[\/footnote] It is not necessarily or readily apparent where this syllogism breaks down. But the result\u2014an all-too-robust freedom of thought\u2014cannot be squared with a rule of law that respects the dignity and rights of all persons. Figuring out how and where and in what way to intervene in this logical chain is a prerequisite to embracing a more expansive freedom of thought for all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",
