United States</i> was not well received.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn4" href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> A primary criticism has been that the Courtâs ruling portends a âlawless presidency.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn5" href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> This criticism, I will argue, rests on a misleading picture of how the criminal law operates inside the executive branch. Many factors other than the Presidentâs vulnerability to criminal law inform executive branch compliance with criminal law. One can certainly imagine a bad-man President after <i>Trump</i> engaging in widespread lawless criminal behavior. But, unfortunately, the bad-man President had many tools to skirt the criminal law before <i>Trump</i>, to which its uncertain immunity ruling added relatively little.</p><p> Which is not to say that the decision wonât impact the presidency. It will, probably in a big way. But its impact will have less to do with the Courtâs immunity rulings than with its related rulings on the Presidentâs exclusive removal power and exclusive power over investigation and prosecution. These rulings, which were novel, expansive, and undertheorized, will play themselves out in litigation about the scope of presidential power for years. This Article, however, will mainly explore the slightly more tractable impact of the decision beyond judicial review and inside the executive branch, which will deploy the decision to help the President overcome legal constraints and win disputes with Congress.</p><p> Part I provides background to <i>Trump</i>. It shows that the Courtâs consequential rulings about exclusive presidential power were neither raised by Trumpâs lawyers in the courts below nor addressed by those courts and were addressed by the Supreme Court as a matter of first impression. Part I explores how and why this happened, and with what significance. Part II analyzes <i>Trump</i>, with special emphasis on the exclusive power rulings. It explains the novelty in these rulings and their potentially very broad implications. Part III assesses how <i>Trump</i> will impact presidential and executive branch compliance with criminal law and speculates how executive branch lawyers will use the exclusive power rulings in the decision to enhance executive branch power.</p><div class="section" id="sc1"><div id="ac_i1" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i1">I.Â  Background</h2><p> The indictment against Trump alleged that he conspired with a Justice Department official and several private persons to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election through public statements and through communication with and pressure on state officials, fraudulent state electors, Department of Justice officials, Vice President Mike Pence, and the joint session of Congress. It alleged that through this conduct Trump conspired to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371; conspired to obstruct an official proceeding in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1512(k); obstructed and attempted to obstruct an official proceeding in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1512(c)(2) and 2; and conspired to deny the rights of persons to vote and have their votes counted in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 241.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn6" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p> Trumpâs lawyers claimed that Trump was immune from all charged conduct that involved official acts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn7" href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> And yet, as I will explain below, they failed to raise in the lower courts what would turn out to be the most important separation of powers issue in the case: limits on Congressâs power to criminalize presidential conduct. Ironically, the Special Counsel, arguing on behalf of the U.S. government, made this issue prominent in briefing and oral argument before the Court. These arguments were the basis for the Courtâs claim that the government âagree[d] with much of [the Courtâs] analysisâ even if the Court reached conclusions sharply at odds with the government.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn8" href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> This Part explains this important background.</p><div class="section" id="sc1.1"><div id="ac_i2" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i2">A.Â  The Precedents</h3><p> Before <i>Trump</i>, the Supreme Court had never ruled on a former Presidentâs immunity from suit because no administration had ever prosecuted a former President before the Biden Administration prosecuted Trump through the quasi-independent Special Counsel.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn9" href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Court had addressed related issues, however. Three decisions were especially relevant in <i>Trump</i>.</p><p> First, <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</i> held that President Harry S. Truman lacked statutory or constitutional authority to direct the Secretary of Commerce to seize and operate certain steel mills during the Korean War.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn10" href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> Justice Jacksonâs concurrence articulated a three-tiered framework to assess presidential power claims âdepending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn11" href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> Jacksonâs third category concerned matters of âexclusive presidential controlâ that âdisabl[e] the Congress from acting upon the subject.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn12" href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> Jackson provided little guidance on Category Three claims beyond suggesting that the President would rarely prevail on them.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn13" href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> The full Court adopted Jacksonâs tripartite framework three decades after <i>Youngstown</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn14" href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> But it was not until 2015, in <i>Zivotofsky v. Kerry</i>, that the Court evaluated a presidential claim of exclusive authority under Jacksonâs third category.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn15" href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> It held that the Presidentâs recognition power was exclusive but did not mention or apply any presumption against presidential exclusivity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn16" href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p> Second, <i>United States v. Nixon</i> recognized an Article IIâbased executive privilege protecting presidential and senior executive branch official communications from disclosure.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn17" href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Court explained: âCertain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn18" href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a> The Court ruled that this executive privilege was not absolute, however, due to a countervailing Article IIIâbased judicial duty âto do justice in criminal prosecutions.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn19" href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Court recognized a âpresumptive privilegeâ for presidential communications that was âfundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn20" href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a> But it ruled that when the privilege is based on a âgeneralized interest in confidentialityâ it âmust yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn21" href="#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p> Third, <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald</i> held that due to âthe special nature of the Presidentâs constitutional office and functions,â a President receives absolute immunity âfrom damages liability for acts within the âouter perimeterâ of his official responsibility.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn22" href="#fn22"><sup>22</sup></a> It explained that a Presidentâs amenability to suit turned on a âbalance [of] the constitutional weight of the interest to be served against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn23" href="#fn23"><sup>23</sup></a> Pointing to <i>Youngstown</i> and <i>United States v. Nixon</i>, the Court stated that â[w]hen judicial action is needed to serve broad public interests â¦ the exercise of jurisdiction has been held warranted.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn24" href="#fn24"><sup>24</sup></a> But, it concluded that in a âmerely private suit for damages based on a Presidentâs official acts,â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn25" href="#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a> the President receives the broad absolute immunity due to his important âdiscretionary responsibilitiesâ and the extraordinary burden that inferior presidential immunity would entail.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn26" href="#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p> Three features of these foundational decisions warrant comment.</p><p> First, all three opinions interpret Article II to carve out areas of presidential power that are impervious to the intrusion of another branch, though in different ways and with different terminology. Jacksonâs <i>Youngstown</i> Category Three recognized the possibility of limits on <i>congressional power to regulate</i> areas of exclusive presidential power. By contrast, the <i>Nixon</i> cases recognized limitations <i>on judicial review</i>. <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald</i> expressed this limitation in terms of a presidential <i>immunity</i> from suit for damages. <i>United States v. Nixon</i> expressed this limitation in terms of a presidential <i>presumptive privilege</i> against disclosure of presidential communications in court. The limits on congressional power contemplated by <i>Youngstown</i> go to the <i>legality</i> of presidential action, while the limit on judicial review contemplated by <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald</i> accommodates the potential harms of judicial review on presidential action but does not affect the underlying legality of presidential conduct.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn27" href="#fn27"><sup>27</sup></a></p><p> Second, neither the Jackson concurrence in <i>Youngstown</i>, nor the majority opinions in the <i>Nixon</i> cases, were examples of what we would today call originalism or even textualism. Jackson did not purport to discern constitutional meaning as fixed at the Founding but did poke fun at a few strands of what became modern originalism.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn28" href="#fn28"><sup>28</sup></a> And, although he marched through the text of Article II, he did not rely on it in a serious way to deny the Presidentâs claims.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn29" href="#fn29"><sup>29</sup></a> The <i>Nixon</i> opinions were not âtextually based,â as Michael Dreeben, the Counselor to the Special Counsel, said at the <i>Trump v. United States</i> oral argument.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn30" href="#fn30"><sup>30</sup></a> Rather, they rested on âconstitutional underpinnings,â as the tapes case put it in the context of presidential communications.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn31" href="#fn31"><sup>31</sup></a> And the <i>Nixon</i> opinions did not mention the views of the Founders, original public meaning, or any other originalist indicator of meaning.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn32" href="#fn32"><sup>32</sup></a></p><p> Third, all three opinions identified exclusive presidential power through functionalist, not formalist, methodology.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn33" href="#fn33"><sup>33</sup></a> Jacksonâs tripartite approach to presidential power is famously anti-formalist.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn34" href="#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a> While it recognized that Category Three housed exclusive presidential powers, it did not reason to such exclusivity by formalist methods. Rather, Jackson described the Presidentâs exclusive authority as the resolution of a clash of powers between the executive and other branches.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn35" href="#fn35"><sup>35</sup></a> The <i>Nixon</i> opinions were overtly anti-formalist. They both balanced presidential claims of authority against the competing claims of the other branches, and they both reached their conclusions based on the Courtâs functional assessment of the impact of judicial actions on executive power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn36" href="#fn36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></div><div class="section" id="sc1.2"><div id="ac_i3" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i3">B.Â  Arguments in the Lower Courts</h3><p> Trumpâs lawyers argued from the outset that a former President is immune from criminal prosecution for conduct involving official acts unless he has been impeached and convicted for the same conduct.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn37" href="#fn37"><sup>37</sup></a> They maintained that <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald</i> should be extended to the criminal context and that <i>Marbury</i> and its progeny supported the Presidentâs immunity from criminal prosecution for public acts undertaken in office.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn38" href="#fn38"><sup>38</sup></a> The focus was on <i>immunity from judicial review</i>, i.e., on âArticle III courts lack[ing] the power to review the Presidentâs official acts under the separation of powers doctrine.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn39" href="#fn39"><sup>39</sup></a> They did not argue that the Constitutionâs separation of powers prevented <i>Congress</i> from criminalizing presidential acts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn40" href="#fn40"><sup>40</sup></a></p><p> The court of appeals, rushing to decision, rejected Trumpâs argument in broad termsâtoo broad.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn41" href="#fn41"><sup>41</sup></a> Following Trumpâs lawyersâ lead, it focused on separation of powers constraints on the judiciary, not Congress. In concluding that the President lacked immunity for his public acts, the court of appeals stated that â[t]he separation of powers doctrine â¦ <i>necessarily permits</i> the Judiciary to oversee the federal criminal prosecution of a former president for his official acts because the fact of the prosecution means that the former president has allegedly acted in defiance of the laws.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn42" href="#fn42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Chief Justice at oral argument expressed âconcernâ that this statement, which he saw as a holding, meant that âa former president can be prosecuted because heâs being prosecuted.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn43" href="#fn43"><sup>43</sup></a> And that is indeed what the statement says.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc1.3"><div id="ac_i4" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i4">C.Â  The Argument Before the Supreme Court</h3><p> The government did not defend this reasoning by the court of appeals in the Supreme Court. When asked about it by Chief Justice Roberts at oral argument, the governmentâs attorney, Dreeben, stated that it was not âthe proper approach in this caseâ and âcertainly not the governmentâs approach.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn44" href="#fn44"><sup>44</sup></a></p><p> The governmentâs more nuanced position on presidential immunity before the Supreme Court reflected what Dreeben described as âequities that are far beyond [the Trump] prosecution.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn45" href="#fn45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Justice Department has duties to both protect the Presidentâs law enforcement prerogatives <i>and</i> to protect the presidency from encroachment by other branches. <i>Trump</i> was a highly unusual case because these interests were potentially in tension.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn46" href="#fn46"><sup>46</sup></a> The Biden Administration had an interest in prosecuting the former President for his alleged crimes. But it also had an interest to prevent undue encroachments on future presidencies by Congress and the courts (and, as the briefs made plain, from future Justice Department prosecutors).<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn47" href="#fn47"><sup>47</sup></a></p><p> In reflection of this tension, and of the Courtâs role in protecting both interests, the government emphasized in the Supreme Court why its argument against immunity for Trump in the January 6 prosecution would not adversely impact future presidencies. One set of reasons concerned the practical barriers to prosecution, including internal Justice Department norms and the grand jury.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn48" href="#fn48"><sup>48</sup></a> Another set of reasons concerned separation of powers limits <i>on Congressâs power</i> to criminalize presidential actions, which the government had mentioned in passing in its briefs below but foregrounded before the Supreme Court. (It is not clear why Trumpâs lawyers failed to address these issues below; the best explanation appears to be, amazingly, that they just missed them.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn49" href="#fn49"><sup>49</sup></a>)</p><p> The centrality of separation of powers constraints on Congress to the governmentâs argument was apparent in Dreebenâs response to the first question he received at oral argument. Justice Thomas asked whether Dreeben was arguing that there was âno â¦ presidential immunity, even for official acts.â Dreeben gave a quick affirmative answer and then immediately shifted ground to a clearly pre-planned framing:<div class="quote"><p> Yes, Justice Thomas, but I think that itâs important to put in perspective the position that we are offering the Court today. The president, as the head of the Article II branch, can assert as-applied <i>Article II objections to criminal laws</i> that interfere with an exclusive power possessed by the president or that prevent the president from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned functions. That is the constitutional doctrine that currently governs the separation of powers.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn50" href="#fn50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></div>In its brief and at oral argument, the government explained that âthe positionâ it was âoffering the Courtâ had several discrete components.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn51" href="#fn51"><sup>51</sup></a></p><p> First, Congress cannot interfere with the Presidentâs âconclusive and preclusive,â i.e., exclusive, powers within the Jackson framework. This category, the government maintained, included the Presidentâs authority to recognize foreign nations, to veto bills, to grant pardons, and to remove at will a principal officer of a single-headed agency.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn52" href="#fn52"><sup>52</sup></a> Second, Congress also cannot enact a statute that as applied to the President would âimpede the Presidentâs ability to carry out his constitutionally assigned duties.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn53" href="#fn53"><sup>53</sup></a></p><p> Third, and closely relatedly, federal courts must construe generally worded statutes to avoid serious questions of unconstitutionality under the first two rationales. This argument came in narrow and broad versions of constitutional avoidance. In some contexts, the government argued, the President can be carved out of a statute on a case-by-case basis.

In recognizing a constitutionally based absolute immunity from judicial review of civil damages suits against the President, <i>Fitzgerald</i> assumed the validity of these implied causes of action but, under the canon of constitutional avoidance, declined to address Congressâs power to create a cause of action for damages against the President.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn59" href="#fn59"><sup>59</sup></a> The Court in <i>Fitzgerald</i> thus left open the possibility that Congress had the constitutional authority to enact a statute imposing civil damages liability on the President for official acts, but said not a word about how this authority might be limited by exclusive presidential power.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc1.4"><div id="ac_i5" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i5">D.Â  Defense or Immunity?</h3><p> The introduction at the Supreme Court of the issue of constitutional limits on Congressâs power to criminalize official presidential acts raised a conceptual difficulty: Should such limits be treated as a defense to prosecution, or as an immunity from judicial review as in <i>Fitzgerald</i>?<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn60" href="#fn60"><sup>60</sup></a></p><p> From one perspective, presidential immunity is a principleâlike absolute immunity for judges, prosecutors, and legislatorsâthat blocks âan otherwise valid legal rule [from being] enforced against a particular defendant in a particular context.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn61" href="#fn61"><sup>61</sup></a> Since a criminal statute that intrudes on an exclusive presidential power is <i>invalid</i>, it would be a defense rather than an immunity on this view.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn62" href="#fn62"><sup>62</sup></a> By contrast, one might see any constitutional constraint on adjudication, including a Jackson Category Three constraint on Congressâs power, as a presidential âimmunityâ in the sense of a constitutional bar on federal courts proceeding against the President.

All of Trumpâs conduct, it maintained, was covered by one of four validly enacted and applied federal criminal statutes. It offered its concessions as comfort to the Court about the implications for the presidency of denying Trump immunity in the case, and perhaps because it suspected the Court would be interested in these issues even though they were not addressed by the courts below.</p><p> But once the government put these issues on the Courtâs plate, several hard questions aroseâquestions that did not have firm answers in the Courtâs case law. Which and how many of the separation of powers theories offered by the government applied in the case, and how? What exactly is the scope of the Presidentâs exclusive Article II powers? How does the Court determine whether a federal criminal law unduly burdens a presidential power or prevents the President from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned duties?</p><p> The proper answers to these questions are notoriously underspecified in the Courtâs jurisprudence and contested among scholars. The government provided no concrete answers to these questions, and the Trump team did not address them. Also difficult and novel, as oral argument made clear, is the role the Presidentâs motives for conduct play in assessing these burdens, and in determining whether his action is official or unofficial.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn68" href="#fn68"><sup>68</sup></a></p><p> The Chief Justice asked Dreeben at oral argument whether, considering the D.C.

But in light of the hard and novel issues raised for the first time before the Court, and the rushed proceedings, the Court and the country might have been better off if the Court had taken the path suggested by the Chief Justice.

It focuses primarily on the first element of the Courtâs immunity holding concerning the Presidentâs exclusive powers vis-Ã -vis Congress.

Specifically, the Court ruled that Congress could not make it a crime for the President to obstruct a congressional proceeding based on the Presidentâs efforts, however corrupt, to enforce federal election law.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn73" href="#fn73"><sup>73</sup></a></p><p> These were the most far-reaching rulings in the decision, and some of the most far-reaching pronouncements about presidential power in the Courtâs history.

But in contrast to Jacksonâs treatment, it was formalist in the extreme.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn74" href="#fn74"><sup>74</sup></a> The Court determined that the Presidentâs communications with the Justice Department were exercises of the Presidentâs Article II removal power and take care duty. And that was that: Both Congressâs Article I powers and the courtsâ Article III powers had to yield without any consideration of the scope of those powers, or how they might overlap with the Presidentâs own powers, and without any effort at balancing the interests or powers of the branches.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn75" href="#fn75"><sup>75</sup></a></p><p> This methodological approach tends to expand the category of exclusive presidential power because it does not consider any countervailing factor once an act is deemed to be an exercise of the exclusive presidential power. The approach is particularly significant because it goes to the underlying legality of presidential action and because the Court married it to novel extensions of the Presidentâs removal power and law enforcement discretion.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc2.1.2"><div id="ac_i10" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h4 class="article-section__title" id="_i10">2.Â  Removal</h4><p> The Court amplified its removal jurisprudence to an uncertain but potentially large degree. The Court in three decisions before Trump had expanded the Presidentâs exclusive removal power in the face of statutory for-cause restrictions on presidential firings.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn76" href="#fn76"><sup>76</sup></a> In <i>Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</i> in 2020, the Court described its precedents as recognizing âonly two exceptions to the Presidentâs unrestricted removal powerâ: âone for multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power, and one for inferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn77" href="#fn77"><sup>77</sup></a></p><p> <i>Trump</i> formally leaves these exceptions in place, though perhaps in a half-hearted way.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn78" href="#fn78"><sup>78</sup></a> But the decision extends the Presidentâs exclusive removal power beyond its traditional domain of resisting for-cause limits on firings to a different context. The Court applied this exclusive power to deny Congress the authority to criminalize a Presidentâs use of the removal power to obstruct a congressional proceeding. That ruling is remarkable enough. But its logic appears to disable Congress from punishing the President for firing or threatening to fire a subordinate official in an effort to facilitate any crime.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn79" href="#fn79"><sup>79</sup></a></p><p> Congress now might be unable, for example, to criminalize a Presidentâs threatened or actual termination of a senior subordinate in order to obstruct justice or to use unlawful force or, possibly, to facilitate a bribe. I qualify this conclusion with respect to bribery because of an exchange between the Chief Justice and Justice Barrett about whether and how a President could be prosecuted for bribery, which opened up a possible yet ill-defined loophole to the majorityâs conclusion about exclusive presidential powers.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn80" href="#fn80"><sup>80</sup></a> Even with this important caveat, the Courtâs removal holding is a significant and never-before-hinted-at expansion of the Presidentâs removal power that was nowhere briefed nor publicly discussed before the ruling. The scope of the principle going forward is unclear.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn81" href="#fn81"><sup>81</sup></a></p></div><div class="section" id="sc2.1.3"><div id="ac_i11" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h4 class="article-section__title" id="_i11">3.Â  Take Care Clause</h4><p> Third, a broader and even more significant holding is that the President has âexclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn82" href="#fn82"><sup>82</sup></a> The Court ostensibly tied this power to the Article II command that the President shall âtake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn83" href="#fn83"><sup>83</sup></a></p><p> The Court provided little support and no analysis for this conclusion. It cited cases about the Presidentâs broad civil and criminal law enforcement discretion that were inapposite because the Court had recognized that this discretion was subject to at least some forms of congressional regulation. The Court had previously ruled, for example, that Congress could âlimit an agencyâs exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities or by circumscribing an agencyâs power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn84" href="#fn84"><sup>84</sup></a> It has also said that an âextreme case of non-enforcement arguably could exceed the bounds of enforcement discretionâ even in the criminal context.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn85" href="#fn85"><sup>85</sup></a></p><p> <i>Trump</i> additionally stated, citing <i>United States v. Nixon</i>, that âthe Executive Branch has âexclusive authority and absolute discretionâ to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn86" href="#fn86"><sup>86</sup></a> But this was a dictum about prosecutorial discretion vis-Ã -vis <i>courts</i> uttered while rejecting justiciability objections to adjudication of the <i>Nixon</i> subpoena. The decision <i>Nixon</i> primarily relied on, <i>The Confiscation Cases</i>, made clear that Congress <i>could</i> constrain prosecutorial discretion.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn87" href="#fn87"><sup>87</sup></a></p><p> Nor did the Court say anything about how its ruling squared with its broader Take Care Clause jurisprudence. That Clause is the main source of presidential discretion whether and how to enforce civil and criminal law.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn88" href="#fn88"><sup>88</sup></a> But it is also the source of âthe Presidentâs duty to abide by and enforce the laws enacted by Congressâ as part of a Presidentâs âduty to respect legislative supremacy and not to act <i>contra legem</i>.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn89" href="#fn89"><sup>89</sup></a> The important case here is <i>Kendall v. United States</i>, where the Court denied that the Take Care Clause gave the President a âdispensing powerâ or âpower to forbid [the lawsâ] execution,â which, if accepted, âwould be clothing the President with a power entirely to control the legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn90" href="#fn90"><sup>90</sup></a></p><p> The Court prior to <i>Trump</i> had never explained how the Take Care Clauseâs power-amplifying support for broad (but defeasible) presidential enforcement discretion squared with the Clauseâs power-constraining command that the President must abide by and enforce federal law. It had justified presidential enforcement discretion vis-Ã -vis <i>courts</i> as a pragmatic accommodation of (i) inevitable enforcement choices and tradeoffs in the face of over-legalization by Congress, (ii) changing public-welfare needs, (iii) executive branch resource constraints, and (iv) the judiciaryâs âlack [of] meaningful standards for assessing the propriety of enforcement choices.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn91" href="#fn91"><sup>91</sup></a> At the same time, as noted above, the Court had suggestedâbut without specificityâthat Congress might constrain at least some elements of executive enforcement discretion in the civil and criminal contexts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn92" href="#fn92"><sup>92</sup></a></p><p> The Court mentioned none of this background, and none of it was discussed in the briefs or at oral argument. Yet its holding that the President has exclusive power to direct subordinates in investigations and prosecutions throws a bomb into this important corner of the law. It is hard to fathom what it might entail.</p><p> The first thing it might entail is the death knell for <i>Morrison</i>âs holding that Congress can âreduce[] the amount of control or supervision that the Attorney General and, through him, the President exercises over the investigation and prosecution of a certain class of alleged criminal activity.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn93" href="#fn93"><sup>93</sup></a> This holding rested in part on the Courtâs approval of removal restrictions for an inferior officer in the Justice Department, a ruling that <i>Trump</i> technically does not address. But <i>Morrison</i> also held that congressional restrictions on presidential (and attorney-general) control over the prosecutorial discretion of a jurisdictionally constrained inferior officer did not violate the separation of powers because it did not unduly burden executive branch power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn94" href="#fn94"><sup>94</sup></a></p><p> This latter holding is hard to square with <i>Trump</i>âs insistence that the Presidentâs control over investigation and prosecution is exclusive vis-Ã -vis Congress and thus (on <i>Trump</i>âs formalist analysis) not subject to any countervailing burden analysis.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn95" href="#fn95"><sup>95</sup></a> In this regard, <i>Trump</i> quoted Justice Scaliaâs <i>Morrison</i> dissent that ââinvestigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive functionââ in order to explain why the allegations against Trump concerning his Justice Department efforts âplainly implicate Trumpâs âconclusive and preclusiveâ authority.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn96" href="#fn96"><sup>96</sup></a></p><p> <i>Trump</i> might go further and call into question some applications of the proposition from <i>United States v. Perkins</i>, reaffirmed in <i>Myers</i>, that âwhen Congress by law vests the appointment of inferior oï¬cers in the heads of departments, it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn97" href="#fn97"><sup>97</sup></a> The basic idea that the removal power is linked to the appointments power is not affected by <i>Trump</i>. But <i>Trump</i> arguably undercuts <i>Perkins</i>â logic, not through the power of removal, but rather through the Presidentâs exclusive power to direct law enforcement activities, which is not tied to his power over appointments. If this power is truly exclusive, then it may not be limitable by Congress with respect to any executive branch action. To the extent that <i>Perkins</i> allows Congress through removal restrictions to prevent a President from directing the law enforcement actions of all subordinate executive branch officials, it might not survive <i>Trump</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn98" href="#fn98"><sup>98</sup></a></p><p> More broadly, the law enforcement discretion ruling in <i>Trump</i> seems to mean that the President has the discretion to use law enforcement tools to achieve ends that Congress has otherwise made illegal. That is, after all, what happened in <i>Trump</i>: Congress had made it a crime to obstruct a congressional proceeding, but the Court held that Congress lacked the power to make this law applicable to the Presidentâs alleged sham investigation of state election fraud because the investigation implicated the Presidentâs exclusive investigative authority. The logic of the holding should extend beyond criminal law enforcement to civil law enforcement.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn99" href="#fn99"><sup>99</sup></a> There seems to be no reason why it would not extend beyond the Justice Department to the Presidentâs direction of all law enforcement activities around the executive branch.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn100" href="#fn100"><sup>100</sup></a> Taken for all it is worth, the Take Care Clause discussion moves in the direction of a presidential dispensation power.</p><p> To get a flavor of the uncertainties about this aspect of the opinion, and what this holding might entail, imagine four situations:<div class="article-content__list"><div class="article-content__list__item"><p><strong>1.Â  </strong>Congress makes it a crime for the President to obstruct a congressional proceeding, and the President decides to enforce federal election law in a way that would otherwise be the crime of obstructing a congressional proceeding.</p></div><div class="article-content__list__item"><p><strong>2.Â  </strong>Congress in one law makes it a crime to transport one or more pounds of cocaine in interstate commerce and in a second law directs the Justice Department not to prosecute transportation of five pounds or less unless a gun was used in the violation.</p></div><div class="article-content__list__item"><p><strong>3.Â  </strong>Congress enacts a law that says it shall be a crime to transport (i) more than five pounds of cocaine in interstate commerce or (ii) less than five pounds of cocaine in interstate commerce if the crime was committed with a gun.</p></div><div class="article-content__list__item"><p><strong>4.Â  </strong>Congress bans TikTok from operating inside the United States and imposes large civil penalties for violations.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn101" href="#fn101"><sup>101</sup></a></p></div></div></p><p> Situation One is <i>Trump v. United States</i>. The Court held that the criminal prohibition against the President obstructing a congressional proceeding had to give way to his exclusive power to enforce federal election law. Although Situation Two is different from Situation One in expressly seeking to limit law enforcement discretion, it is like Situation One in seeking in one law to constrain the Presidentâs discretion to enforce another law. It is unclear how <i>Trump</i> operates in Situation Two, though one could argue that it means that the second law, the one that seeks to constrain presidential discretion, is unconstitutional.</p><p> Situation Two seems functionally similar to Situation Three. But in Situation Three, Congress has limited presidential enforcement power not by placing limits on enforcement discretion directly, but rather in the manner it has defined the crimes. Since a President has no crime-making power and cannot prosecute crimes that do not exist, congressional control of presidential enforcement discretion in Situation Three, though functionally like Situation Two, seems untouched by <i>Trump</i>.</p><p> Situation Four is the TikTok ban.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn102" href="#fn102"><sup>102</sup></a> In an executive order (EO) on January 20, President Trump instructed the Attorney General to not enforce the act for seventy-five days so that Trump could assess the foreign policy implications of the ban and negotiate a workaround.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn103" href="#fn103"><sup>103</sup></a> The President also ordered the Attorney General to inform the private firms that âthere has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conductâ in violation of the statute during the seventy-five-day period (or after the effective date of the act and before the EO). This action, unlike <i>Trump</i>, is not the violation of a statute through enforcement of another but rather seems more like the assertion of a dispensation power not to enforce due to a policy objection. <i>Trump</i> may point in this direction but does not by its terms go this far. And Trumpâs TikTok order seems to blow through the Courtâs concerns about blanket non-enforcement in <i>Texas</i> and about a dispensation power in <i>Kendall</i>.</p><p> Justice Barrett noted in concurrence that she did ânot understand the Court to hold that <i>all</i> exercises of the Take Care power fall within the core executive power,â and the Court certainly did not insist or make clear otherwise.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn104" href="#fn104"><sup>104</sup></a> So we do not know the scope of the Courtâs ruling on exclusive enforcement discretion or the extent to which it is tied to the Take Care Clause.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn105" href="#fn105"><sup>105</sup></a> My only point is that the Courtâs ruling about the Presidentâs exclusive control over the investigative and prosecutorial function ostensibly tied to the Take Care Clause opens up a bevy of possible new implications about the scope of presidential power, both vertically within the executive branch and with respect to law enforcement in the world.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc2.1.4"><div id="ac_i12" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h4 class="article-section__title" id="_i12">4.Â  Unitary Executive</h4><p> The theory of the unitary executive is that all of the executive power is vested in the President and the President, through removal or other tools, thus has the authority to manage and direct all executive branch officials.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn106" href="#fn106"><sup>106</sup></a> The theory has a long history but came to prominence during the Reagan Administration.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn107" href="#fn107"><sup>107</sup></a> Taken to its logical end, it entails that the President has control over every executive branch decision and that any congressional effort to deny him that power by preventing the President from ordering an action or firing an insubordinate official is unconstitutional.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn108" href="#fn108"><sup>108</sup></a></p><p> The Supreme Court has never fully embraced the unitary executive theory. <i>Trump</i> may be the closest it has ever come.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn109" href="#fn109"><sup>109</sup></a> The Court reiterated that all of the executive power is vested in the President and that âunlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn110" href="#fn110"><sup>110</sup></a> It expands presidential removal power beyond prior baselines, as noted above.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn111" href="#fn111"><sup>111</sup></a> The Court also underscored the Presidentâs âdirective powerâ over subordinate official actions.

The Courtâs holding about the Presidentâs exclusive control over how the executive branch enforces the law now adds to the Presidentâs removal power in enhancing the Presidentâs vertical control over executive branch action, especially since that vertical control gives the President expanded discretion from the pre-<i>Trump</i> baseline over when and how to enforce (and thus, perhaps, comply with) federal law.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sc2.2"><div id="ac_i13" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i13">B.Â  Functional Immunity for Non-Exclusive Powers</h3><p> The Court followed its formalist analysis of presidential âimmunityâ for exclusive presidential powers with a functional analysis of presidential immunity for non-exclusive presidential powers âshared with Congress.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn113" href="#fn113"><sup>113</sup></a></p><p> The Court resolved this issue by melding the two functionalist <i>Nixon</i> opinions about immunity from judicial review.

It instead ruled that the tentative âpresumptive immunityâ applied to the Presidentâs non-exclusive official acts âunless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no âdangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.ââ<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn117" href="#fn117"><sup>117</sup></a> This âbalancingâ test seems more generous to the President than the <i>Fitzgerald</i> case that it quotes, since it leaves out <i>Fitzgerald</i>âs countervailing consideration of âthe constitutional weight of the interest to be served.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn118" href="#fn118"><sup>118</sup></a> Whatever its scope, the immunity here, as in <i>Fitzgerald</i> itself, did not concern the legality of the Presidentâs underlying acts, but rather shielded the President from adjudication due to the impact on the presidency.</p><p> This functional analysis has a made-up feel and is an analytical mess, though perhaps no more made up and no messier than the functional analyses in the two <i>Nixon</i> decisions on which it relied, or any functional separation of powers analysis.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn119" href="#fn119"><sup>119</sup></a> The Court did not explain why the low chance of high-cost criminal prosecution and punishment âare plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmakingâ than the many magnitudes greater possibility of civil damages liability. One can imagine this calculus cashing out in the opposite way, as the dissent suggested, though in truth there are no metrics here.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn120" href="#fn120"><sup>120</sup></a> Nor did the Court explain why it could not decide at this stage if the Constitution demanded absolute or presumptive immunity in this context.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn121" href="#fn121"><sup>121</sup></a> <i>Nixon v.

But the Court did establish three additional propositionsânone of which were briefedâthat are vital to the scope of the presumptive immunity it recognized.</p><p> First, the Court provided guidance on how to distinguish official from unofficial acts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn124" href="#fn124"><sup>124</sup></a> This is a crucial distinction since many of Trumpâs alleged crimes were not obviously in one camp or the other, and since unofficial acts receive no immunity. <i>Trump</i> ruled that the Presidentâs official acts include everything he is authorized to do and more, since some official acts, like âspeaking to and on behalf of the American people,â are not authorized in any constitutionally conventional sense.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn125" href="#fn125"><sup>125</sup></a> The Court thus concluded that the âouter perimeterâ of official acts includes actions that are ânot manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn126" href="#fn126"><sup>126</sup></a> It further ruled that President Trumpâs communications with Vice President Pence to pressure him to âreject Statesâ legitimate electoral votes or send them back to state legislatures for reviewâ was an official act since the discussions involved their official conduct.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn127" href="#fn127"><sup>127</sup></a> Trump was thus at least presumptively immune against this charge, though the Court remanded on the question whether prosecution would unduly interfere with presidential power.</p><p> Second, the Court stated that âin dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the Presidentâs motives,â since that inquiry would ârisk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn128" href="#fn128"><sup>128</sup></a> The Court borrowed this idea from <i>Fitzgerald</i>, where it was used not as a basis to distinguish official from unofficial acts, but rather as a reason the President warranted absolute immunity for official conduct in a civil suit.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn129" href="#fn129"><sup>129</sup></a></p><p> Third, the Court ruled that in prosecuting a President for crimes committed in an unofficial capacity, the jury could not consider evidence concerning the Presidentâs official acts. Such consideration, the Court explained, âwould permit a prosecutor to do indirectly what he cannot do directlyâinvite the jury to examine acts for which a President is immune from prosecution,â thereby defeating the intended effect of immunity by âheighten[ing] the prospect that the Presidentâs official decisionmaking will be distorted.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn130" href="#fn130"><sup>130</sup></a> Justice Barrett, who joined the rest of the majority opinion, did not join this analysis. She asserted (without further explanation) that the Constitution âdoes not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents <i>can</i> be held liable,â and claimed that the rules of evidence could accommodate any concerns about the impact on the presidency.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn131" href="#fn131"><sup>131</sup></a> It was in this context that Justice Barrett and the Chief Justice had the hard-to-fathom dispute about whether the majority rule would or would not permit the President to be prosecuted for a bribe.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn132" href="#fn132"><sup>132</sup></a></p></div><div class="section" id="sc2.3"><div id="ac_i14" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i14">C.Â  The Denouement, and What Really Matters</h3><p> <i>Trump</i> technically decided very littleâbasically only that the President was immune in connection with the charge related to Justice Department communications, and that his communications with Vice President Pence were official acts for which he might receive immunity. The scope of immunity it conferred was potentially broad but also possibly quite narrow, depending on how the opinionâs ambiguities are resolved. Some critics claimed that the Court effectively immunized Trump from all criminal liability, but that is likely not true.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn133" href="#fn133"><sup>133</sup></a> The governmentâs superseding indictment on remand read <i>Trump</i> to permit every element of the original prosecution save the one involving communications with the Justice Department.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn134" href="#fn134"><sup>134</sup></a> The government was not obviously wrong in its judgment. <i>Trump</i> was open-ended and inconclusive enough that it might well have permitted the government to surmount presidential immunity for all of the remaining charges.</p><p> We may never get clarity on the scope of the presidential immunity announced in <i>Trump</i>. Trump won the presidential election of 2024 and Smith dropped all of the charges. That means that many of the open questions in the opinion about presidential immunity will not be resolved by courts until, if ever, a former President is once against prosecuted.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn135" href="#fn135"><sup>135</sup></a> Such unresolved issues could include the ultimate scope of presumptive immunity for official acts within the Presidentâs non-exclusive power, the related issue of the distinction between official and unofficial acts in this criminal law context, and the actual availability of official acts evidence to prove unofficial acts crimes.</p><p> This does not mean, however, that <i>Trump</i> will be irrelevant. Far from it. The immunity ruling, as uncertain as it is, could impact the calculus of executive branch actors even without further judicial clarification. And entirely independently of the Courtâs rulings about the scope of presidential immunity, the Courtâs discussion of the Presidentâs exclusive presidential power will have a large impact. It is to this issue that I now turn.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sc3"><div id="ac_i15" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i15">III.Â  How <i>Trump</i> Impacts the Presidency</h2><p> Many critics claim that <i>Trump</i> opens the floodgates to a âlawless presidency.â Justice Sotomayor in dissent, for example, said that the majority âeffectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn136" href="#fn136"><sup>136</sup></a> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson similarly argued that the majority opinion alters the âindividual accountability modelâ that had previously guided Presidents and thus âundermines the constraints of the law as a deterrent for future Presidents who might otherwise abuse their power.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn137" href="#fn137"><sup>137</sup></a> Critics of the opinion echoed these themes.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn138" href="#fn138"><sup>138</sup></a> These claims must specifically concern presidential violation of criminal laws, since Presidents since <i>Fitzgerald</i> have had absolute immunity from civil suits over their official acts.</p><p> With so many loose ends in the undisciplined <i>Trump</i> opinion, it is impossible to assess these claims with certainty. They are surely overstated at least to the extent that they assume <i>Trump</i> clearly established a broad presidential criminal immunity. It did not. <i>Trump</i>âs diminishment of the deterrent effect of the criminal law, even on the criticsâ assumptions, is wildly uncertain.</p><p> This Part offers counterpoints to dominant claims about how <i>Trump</i> will impact the presidency. In Section III.A, I offer reasons to doubt that the decision will lead to rampant presidential criminality. The argument here might be unsatisfying to some, since it ultimately rests on the claim that a President had all the tools he needed to achieve rampant criminality long before <i>Trump</i>, to which the decision adds relatively little. In Section III.B, I focus on an area where I think <i>Trump</i> will have a larger impact: in expanding the scope of presidential power vis-Ã -vis Congress, not as a result of the immunity holding <i>per se</i>, but rather as a result of the Courtâs underlying rulings on the removal power, the take care duty, and exclusive presidential power more generally.</p><div class="section" id="sc3.1"><div id="ac_i16" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i16">A.Â  Criminal Law Inside the Executive Branch</h3><div class="section" id="sc3.1.1"><div id="ac_i17" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h4 class="article-section__title" id="_i17">1.Â  Subordinate Liability</h4><p> We do not have a great sense about how much, if at all, past Presidents pondered or might have been deterred by criminal liability in deciding whether to commit crimes. Richard Nixon knowingly committed crimes in his efforts to cover up the Watergate break-in, and he feared exposure and possibly jail even as he continued his criminal ways.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn139" href="#fn139"><sup>139</sup></a> Presidents after Nixon have been accused of acting criminally, but we have little insight into how if at all fear of criminal liability influenced their decisions in office related to these allegations.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn140" href="#fn140"><sup>140</sup></a> And the criminal law violations alleged in the indictment against Trump do not seem to have deterred him even though it was the official view of the executive branch, and widely believed at the time, that he could be prosecuted after office for crimes committed in office.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn141" href="#fn141"><sup>141</sup></a></p><p> Without a firm sense of whether or how much Presidents were deterred by criminal law prior to <i>Trump</i>, it is hard to assess the marginal impact of an uncertain immunity from prosecution on presidential behavior. But I have found no evidence that an âindividual accountability modelâ influenced presidential behavior related to crime.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn142" href="#fn142"><sup>142</sup></a></p><p> Even if one reads <i>Trump</i> to confer a broad presidential immunity, and even if a President is more motivated to commit a crime after <i>Trump</i> than before due to the reduced deterrent effect of criminal law, it does not follow that presidential crimes are easy to pull off. The reason is that normally, and for the vast majority of presidential criminal acts, a President must rely on executive branch subordinates who are not immune from criminal liability even if the President is immune.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn143" href="#fn143"><sup>143</sup></a> The President cannot effectuate a coup or assassinate political rivals (to take two commonly mentioned examples) without the assistance of people who are subject to criminal law. Even issuing a corrupt pardon typically involves executive branch middlemen.</p><p> Subordinate liability is one reason why administrations do not engage in rampant violations of civil law. The President has absolute immunity for official acts, but subordinate officials have only qualified immunity for such acts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn144" href="#fn144"><sup>144</sup></a> Another reason is that various professional norms have (at least historically) constrained executive branch malfeasance to some degree.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn145" href="#fn145"><sup>145</sup></a> For similar reasons, a principle of subordinate criminal liability, combined with associated executive branch norms of right behavior, have likely been the main historical determinants of executive branch compliance with criminal law.</p><p> To see how subordinate liability works, consider Justice Sotomayorâs claim that a President would be immune from criminal liability if he or she ordered the Navyâs Seal Team Six to assassinate a political rival. This does not follow from <i>Trump</i> because the assassination order would almost certainly not be an exclusive presidential power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn146" href="#fn146"><sup>146</sup></a> Thus, if the President ordered this action, and if it were an official act, it would fall at best in the category of presumptively immune and thus possibly be defeated by the balancing test. And even if the President is immune from prosecution for ordering the assassination, the soldiers could be prosecuted by the next President.</p><p> The potential criminal liability for subordinates is an important hurdle for a lawless President to carry out lawless acts. Consider Volume Two of the <i>Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election</i>, known as the âMueller Report.â The Report documented ten instances of then-former President Trump allegedly seeking to obstruct the ongoing FBI investigation into Russiaâs interference in the 2016 presidential election.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn147" href="#fn147"><sup>147</sup></a> What is remarkable about these episodes is that Trumpâs âefforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, â¦ largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn148" href="#fn148"><sup>148</sup></a></p><p> These officials declined to carry out the Presidentâs instructions to impede the investigation in part, perhaps large part, out of fear of violating the criminal obstruction statute even though Trump himself was oblivious to it. The Mueller Report included a White House Counselâs Office note from March 2, 2017.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn149" href="#fn149"><sup>149</sup></a> The note was written soon after Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation in the face of pressure not to recuse from President Trump through White House Counsel Don McGahn.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn150" href="#fn150"><sup>150</sup></a> The note stated: âNo contact w/Sessionsâ and âNo comms / Serious concerns about obstruction.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn151" href="#fn151"><sup>151</sup></a> Journalistic treatments of this period indicate that this obstruction concern permeated the White House Counselâs Office during this period.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn152" href="#fn152"><sup>152</sup></a></p><p> One can read <i>Trump</i> to weaken or possibly eliminate the principle of subordinate liability.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn153" href="#fn153"><sup>153</sup></a> The Court in <i>Zivotofsky</i> ruled that a civil statute that impinged on an exclusive presidential power did not bind State Department subordinates.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn154" href="#fn154"><sup>154</sup></a> The theory seems to be that a statute that prevents a subordinate from exercising an exclusive presidential power in effect prevents the President from exercising the power. On this view, if the Justice Department officials whom Trump tried to influence carried out his allegedly illegal scheme, they would benefit from his immunity because they are, in the words of <i>Trump</i>, âcarry[ing] out his constitutional dutiesâ to faithfully execute the law, an exclusive presidential power for which he received immunity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn155" href="#fn155"><sup>155</sup></a> This conclusion may be bolstered by <i>Trump</i>âs statement that âthe interests that underlie Presidential immunity seek to protect not the President himself, but the institution of the Presidency,â and by its occasional references to the âexclusive authorityâ of âthe Executive Branchâ in its discussion of Trumpâs immunity in connection with Department of Justice communications.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn156" href="#fn156"><sup>156</sup></a></p><p> This is a powerful argument but there are countervailing considerations. <i>Trump</i> nowhere hinted that it was extending immunity to subordinates. The Court emphasized that its decision turned on the unique position of the President in the constitutional scheme and the need to protect presidential decisionmaking, and its holding about immunity concerned only the President. Moreover, <i>Trump</i> emphasized presidential exclusivity in the context of âdiscuss[ing] potential investigations and prosecutions with the Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry outâ his Take Care Clause duties.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn157" href="#fn157"><sup>157</sup></a> It is possible after <i>Trump</i> that Congress cannot apply, say, the obstruction of justice statute to subordinates who advise the President on matters within his exclusive authority but could apply it to subordinates who go beyond advice and carry out a Presidentâs otherwise unlawful order to obstruct.</p><p> More fundamentally, any extension of <i>Trump</i> to eliminate subordinate liability for exclusive presidential actions would be contrary to the care the Court has taken, with respect to other remedies, to preserve subordinate liability even when granting absolute presidential immunity. For example, on the same day that <i>Nixon v. Fitzgerald</i> recognized absolute immunity from civil liability for the President, the Court in <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald</i> rejected absolute immunity for senior executive branch officials for the same conduct and instead gave them only qualified immunity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn158" href="#fn158"><sup>158</sup></a> Similarly, the Court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the President but it is commonplace to enjoin the lower-level officials, including cabinet officials, for the same conduct.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn159" href="#fn159"><sup>159</sup></a> The availability of remedies against presidential subordinates even when the President receives absolute immunity accommodates the Presidentâs special position in the constitutional scheme with the need for government accountability to law.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn160" href="#fn160"><sup>160</sup></a> The same accommodation would serve the same aim in the criminal immunity context as well.</p><p> To the extent that subordinate liability survives <i>Trump</i>, it is, considered in isolation, a check on a lawless President. But it is only a check for a President who already possesses a sense of restraint due to law or norms or politics. If a President is determined to be lawless, then law cannot as a practical matter constrain him or her.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc3.1.2"><div id="ac_i18" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h4 class="article-section__title" id="_i18">2.Â  The Powers of a Bad-Man President</h4><p> Those who think <i>Trump</i> leads to a lawless presidency are implicitly assuming a bad-man President who is oblivious to the norms and other non-legal expectations of the office, and who follows narrow self-interest right up to the point that the effective sanction of law allows it.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn161" href="#fn161"><sup>161</sup></a> With the threatened sanction of criminal law gone, the critics think, the bad-man President is cut loose to do all sorts of awful illegal things that serve the Presidentâs narrow private interests.</p><p> The problem with this argument is that once we are in the world of a bad-man President, law (including the operation of subordinate criminal liability) cannot easily constrain him. Put differently, a bad-man President had the tools to effectuate widespread executive branch criminality with impunity long before <i>Trump</i>. I will focus on two such toolsâthe reliance on a legal interpretation and the pardon powerâbut there are others.</p><div class="section" id="sc3.1.2.1"><div id="ac_i19" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h5 class="article-section__title" id="_i19">a.Â  A Golden Shield</h5><p> Since the beginning of the nation, clauses in Article IIââthe executive Powerâ and the Take Care Clausesâhave been interpreted to give the President the authority to interpret the law definitively for the executive branch. This power can be seen as an incident of the Presidentâs enforcement power: âBefore the President can obey and enforce the laws, he must determine their meaning, what they authorize and prohibit, and how they fit together.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn162" href="#fn162"><sup>162</sup></a> This power of interpretation includes the power âto interpret and apply the Constitutionâ and to disregard statutes that the President determines violates the Constitution.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn163" href="#fn163"><sup>163</sup></a> The President typically delegates the interpretive power to the Attorney General, who in turn typically delegates it to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn164" href="#fn164"><sup>164</sup></a></p><p> The Attorney General and by delegation OLC have an underappreciated superpower. When they write the President or another executive branch official a legal opinion concluding that a course of action is lawful under a criminal statute, that President or executive branch official will not be prosecuted by a subsequent administration. Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) general counsel John Rizzo referred to this immunity-conferring power of the Justice Department legal interpretations as a âgolden shield.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn165" href="#fn165"><sup>165</sup></a> Rizzo was referring specifically to the effect of the notorious OLC opinions ruling that the criminal prohibition on torture did not forbid the CIAâs brutal post-9/11 interrogation techniques. Those opinions were sought by the White House in a distorted process that aimed to greenlight the CIA program. They were badly legally flawed on multiple levels.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn166" href="#fn166"><sup>166</sup></a></p><p> And yet despite these deep flaws in process and substance, the golden shield worked. President Obamaâs Attorney General, Eric Holder, believed that the OLC opinions were appallingly bad and that elements of the CIA program were illegal. But when he ordered an investigation of the Bush-era CIA program, he made clear that he would, in his words, ânot prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn167" href="#fn167"><sup>167</sup></a> There are many reasons why he might have reached this conclusion. But one reason was a legal doctrine called <i>entrapment by estoppel</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn168" href="#fn168"><sup>168</sup></a> Under this doctrine, it is a violation of due process to prosecute anyone who reasonably relies on an authorized government representativeâs claim that an action is lawful.</p><p> Entrapment by estoppel is the most powerful of a cluster of executive branch doctrines that undergird the immunity-conferring power of legal advice related to criminal statutes.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn169" href="#fn169"><sup>169</sup></a> At oral argument in <i>Trump</i>, the governmentâs attorney, Dreeben, held up entrapment by estoppel as an important protection for the President entirely independent of other immunity doctrines. He told the Justices that âit would be a due process problem to prosecute a President who received advice from the Attorney General that his actions were lawful absent the kind of collusion or conspiracy that itself represented a criminal violation, which I donât really see as being a realistic option.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn170" href="#fn170"><sup>170</sup></a> Dreeben mentioned the limit on entrapment by estoppelâcollusion or conspiracyâbut they are uncertain and distant limits.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn171" href="#fn171"><sup>171</sup></a> The permissive OLC torture opinions, to take one notorious example, did not come close to the level of a criminal conspiracy and had full legal effect as a golden shield.</p><p> Entrapment by estoppel in this context has critics. The Justice Department does not offer its legal advice at armâs length to the President so there is a danger of collusion (as mentioned above) or undue influence.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn172" href="#fn172"><sup>172</sup></a> Entrapment by estoppel if too generous threatens to blur into a dispensing power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn173" href="#fn173"><sup>173</sup></a> And it is an odd inversion for the Attorney General, exercising interpretive power delegated from the President, to be able to protect the President from later criminal prosecution in ways that presidential auto-interpretation could not.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn174" href="#fn174"><sup>174</sup></a></p><p> These are all fair points that might be relevant to the contours of an entrapment by estoppel defense to a federal prosecution.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn175" href="#fn175"><sup>175</sup></a> But the real bite of reliance on an approving Justice Department opinion is that the Department likely will not bring such a prosecution absent collusion or conspiracy. This has to do with institutional reasons that transcend the best understanding of what due process requires at trial, including the governmentâs need to promote reliance on authoritative legal opinions within the executive branch and inter-administration comity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn176" href="#fn176"><sup>176</sup></a></p><p> It is easy to imagine a prescient bad-man President getting a golden-shield legal opinion from his Attorney General or OLC prior to January 6 to the effect that none of the statutes that former President Trump is charged with violating in the January 6 prosecution apply to the Presidentâs official acts. Such an opinion would rely on a different executive branch interpretive legal principle that was also discussed in the governmentâs brief: the principle that generally worded criminal statutes that âarguably limit the Presidentâs constitutional roleâ or involve a âpossible conflict with the Presidentâs constitutional prerogativesâ do not apply to the President absent a plain statement.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn177" href="#fn177"><sup>177</sup></a></p><p> We do not have to speculate very much about whether this is a plausible scenario. Trumpâs first-term Attorney General William Barr in 2018, before he came back to office, wrote a famous memo that argued that the plain statement rule precluded Robert Mueller from applying the main obstruction of justice statute to the allegedly obstructing Trump acts he was investigating in the Russian collusion matter, at least as Barr understood those acts at the time.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn178" href="#fn178"><sup>178</sup></a> This is the very same statute that supports two of the four charges against Trump in the January 6 prosecution.</p><p> People can and do disagree about how the OLC plain statement rule <i>best applies</i> to the statutes Trump is charged with violating. The Special Counsel acknowledged the OLC principle in its brief and read it narrowly.

This one is easier to see, so I will be briefer.</p><p> As the Court noted in <i>Trump</i>, the pardon power is broad and exclusive.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn182" href="#fn182"><sup>182</sup></a> âIt extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency or after conviction and judgment.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn183" href="#fn183"><sup>183</sup></a> A bad-man President could pardon subordinates who, for example, carried out an assassination or a coup, just as Trump on the evening of January 6 (or any time before leaving office) could have pardoned everyone involved who was later indicted, thereby precluding the indictments. Also, recall that Trump pardoned cronies who were investigated and convicted by Mueller.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn184" href="#fn184"><sup>184</sup></a> Finally, no one knows if a President can pardon himself, but many commentators believe the President can.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn185" href="#fn185"><sup>185</sup></a></p><p> President Bidenâs recent âpreemptiveâ pardonsâi.e., pardons before charge or indictmentâfor officials whom he worried President Trump might prosecute is perhaps the best example of how pardons can operate to immunize criminal wrongdoing.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn186" href="#fn186"><sup>186</sup></a> I am not suggesting that the government officials Biden pardoned committed crimes. But the same pardon power that Biden exercised can be deployed by a bad-man President to eliminate the criminal liability of subordinate officials who commit (or might have committed) actual crimes.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn187" href="#fn187"><sup>187</sup></a> The pardon power could, for example, wipe out the criminal liability for one who on presidential command assassinates a political opponent. And the pardon power can be used on a very broad scale. Indeed, it does not appear to have limits of scale restricting the numbers of people who could be preemptively pardoned.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn188" href="#fn188"><sup>188</sup></a></p><p> Congress before <i>Trump</i> might have been able to temper these abuses through statutes that criminalize overt presidential pardons used, for example, as bribes or to obstruct justice or as part of a conspiracy to commit a crime. A pardon (or other form of commutation) is âabsoluteâ for the beneficiary of the pardon. As the Court stated in <i>Trump</i>, the âlegislature cannot change <i>the effect</i> of â¦ a pardon.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn189" href="#fn189"><sup>189</sup></a> It might not follow, however, that a pardon affords the President, as grantor of the pardon, freedom from criminalization of bad acts in connection with the Presidentâs granting a pardon.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn190" href="#fn190"><sup>190</sup></a></p><p> The Court has never addressed this issue, though <i>Trump</i> did say, in dicta, that the Presidentâs âauthority to pardon â¦ is âconclusive and preclusive,â âdisabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.ââ<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn191" href="#fn191"><sup>191</sup></a> Given <i>Trump</i>âs broad and formalistic understanding of exclusive presidential powers, any criminal statute that purports to regulate the pardon power, and not just ones that regulate the âeffectâ of the pardon power, may be off limits. And even if Congress could in theory criminalize bad-act pardons in ways that did not limit the âeffectâ of a pardon, a President might well be able to issue blanket preemptive pardons to subordinates without running afoul of such statutes.</p><p> The pardon power, in short, is a massive criminal-law-evading mechanism in the hands of a bad-man President, right there on the face of Article II.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc3.1.2.3"><div id="ac_i21" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h5 class="article-section__title" id="_i21">c.Â  A More Realistic Picture</h5><p> The point of this analysis of a bad-man Presidentâs robust law-skirting tools is to highlight the relative insignificance of the presidential immunity ruling in <i>Trump</i>. I have argued that Presidents were not obviously deterred by criminal law prior to <i>Trump</i> and thus that their decisional calculus in the face of criminal law might not change much after the decision; that executive branch compliance with criminal law to date has mainly been secured by norms and subordinate official liability; that a bad-man President had plenty of ways to weaken or eliminate the effect of norms and subordinate liability prior to <i>Trump</i>, including through golden shield legal opinions and through pardons; and thus, for all of these reasons, that the marginal impact of the uncertain immunity ruling on a bad-man President is unlikely to be significant. This is a different and I believe more realistic picture of presidential compliance with criminal law than one that sees post-presidency enforcement of criminal law against the President as the main check, and a significant one, on presidential criminality.</p><p> I am not claiming that the immunity ruling in <i>Trump</i> will have zero impact on presidential branch adherence to criminal law. Under various assumptions, the ruling could embolden a President to commit more criminal acts than before or to push subordinates harder to do so. One can imagine that a bad-man President who is inclined to pardon all criminality by subordinates, and to pardon himself, and to solicit maximal protective legal opinions, might nonetheless be marginally more inclined to commit a crime in light of the uncertain immunity conferred by <i>Trump</i> than before the decision due to the uncertainties in self-pardons and protective legal opinions and despite the uncertainties in <i>Trump</i>. But something like this analysis, and not a version of the individual accountability model, explains the incentives of the bad-man President.</p><p> I have discussed the bad-man President because I think it is an implicit assumption in the dissents in <i>Trump</i> and because I think it is a useful heuristic to explain the redoubtable power that the executive branch in theory has to engage in lawless criminal behavior if it really wants to, independent of and prior to the Courtâs immunity ruling. The larger lesson here is a sobering one: Criminal law cannot constrain a determined bad-man President. The potentially effective remedies for presidential criminality are impeachment and elections. As we have learned in recent years, those remedies are not terribly effective in checking a law-defying President.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="sc3.2"><div id="ac_i22" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i22">B.Â  trumpâs exclusive power inside the executive branch</h3><p> While I do not think the immunity holding of <i>Trump</i> will have a large impact on the criminality of a bad-man presidency, I do believe that <i>Trump</i>âs analysis of exclusive presidential power vis-Ã -vis Congress will have a large impact on the scope of presidential power in other respects. Some and perhaps many of these implications should be worked out in the months and years ahead in federal courts as a result of the second Trump Administrationâs aggressive assertions of presidential power on a number of fronts, many of which are potentially supported by <i>Trump</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn192" href="#fn192"><sup>192</sup></a> The Court might read the uncertainties in <i>Trump</i> broadly or narrowly, depending on the issues that come up and how they are framed. It is hard to predict.</p><p> But it is not hard to predict how <i>the executive branch</i> will use the <i>Trump</i> rulings, at least until they are later revised by courts. In litigation it will invoke them in support of broad presidential power. It will also invoke them inside the executive branch, in many contexts outside of judicial review, in deciding which executive branch actions are lawful, and in deciding, relatedly, which congressional statutes to disregard as unconstitutional.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn193" href="#fn193"><sup>193</sup></a></p><p> Executive branch lawyers do not interpret the law as courts do. They follow Supreme Court precedents when they are on point, but they also give great weight to executive branch historical practice and executive branch legal opinions, both of which are often more salient.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn194" href="#fn194"><sup>194</sup></a> Executive branch lawyers, and executive branch precedents, tend to view executive power in broader terms, often much broader, than do courts. Especially when there is no strictly controlling judicial precedent, executive branch lawyers âtend[] to rely on general principles embodied in Supreme Court dicta, especially ones that favor presidential power.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn195" href="#fn195"><sup>195</sup></a> And they tend to construe dicta and legal ambiguities in the Presidentâs favor.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn196" href="#fn196"><sup>196</sup></a></p><p> One cannot say precisely how OLC lawyers or other executive branch lawyers will interpret <i>Trump</i> because lawyers across administrations take different interpretive approaches despite a common institutional outlook. As a general matter, Republican executive branch lawyers are more committed to a strong view of the unitary executive and will be more likely on average than their Democratic counterparts to run with <i>Trump</i>. And the lawyers in the Republican Trump Administration are pushing a maximalist version of the unitary executive theory.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn197" href="#fn197"><sup>197</sup></a> There is no way to know the range of issues to which <i>Trump</i> may be relevant inside the executive branch.

Many elements of its immunity analysis were not briefed or addressed by the courts below, or by petitioner Trump in the Supreme Court. <i>Trump</i> also made entirely new law on the Presidentâs exclusive removal power and the Presidentâs exclusive power of investigation and prosecution. None of the issues addressed in the Courtâs exclusive power analysis were briefed or addressed by the courts below or briefed or discussed at oral argument by either party in the Supreme Court. The Court ruled on massively important issues of first impression about the nature and scope of presidential power in a short time frame and basically without any outside assistance.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn220" href="#fn220"><sup>220</sup></a> The results of these unusual and possibly unprecedented circumstances, I have tried to show, were a confused mess.</p><p> Most of the concern about <i>Trump</i> has focused on the implications of its immunity rulings. I have argued that the generative element of the opinion is not the immunity ruling <i>per se</i>, but rather the exclusive power analysis that underlies the absolute immunity ruling. The Court has traditionally proceeded cautiously and carefully when marking out exclusive presidential power because the President is known to run hard when the Court recognizes such power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn221" href="#fn221"><sup>221</sup></a> But it did the opposite in <i>Trump</i>.

But this speculation is implausible since, as explained above, the Trump team raised many other issues in the motions to dismiss that were clearly defenses and could clearly be appealed only after trial. In addition, as Justice Barrett wrote in her concurrence, there was a powerful argument that the separation of powers claim, even if a defense, was still subject to interlocutory review. <i>See</i> Trump v.
