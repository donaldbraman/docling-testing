This skepticism has produced far-ranging effects: most recently, it has undergirded the Supreme Court’s invalidation of privacy rights. Many others have contested the presumption against unenumerated law, including a recent wave of scholarship which criticizes “enumerationism.” These efforts have been hampered, however, by the fact that they are unable to point to a concrete example of a tacit power or right that is entirely independent from and coequal with an enumerated power or right.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This Article demonstrates—for the first time—that at least one such power exists: the power to charter corporations. Trillions of dollars circulate through the federal corporate form. Yet scholars often assume that the Constitution has nothing to say about corporations. The doctrine of federal incorporation, meanwhile, is confused: courts analogize federal corporations to state corporations or federal agencies, despite obvious inconsistencies, or avoid them altogether. As this Article demonstrates, however, the Framers understood the power to charter corporations as an independent power with its own prerogatives and limits, and there was little doubt about the power’s constitutionality following ratification. In fact, as this Article shows, the Marshall Court constructed doctrine defining this preexisting power across three cases—</em>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward<em>, </em>McCulloch v. Maryland<em>, and </em>Osborn v. Bank of the United States<em>— establishing an independent threshold for the creation of federal corporations: “constitutional” purpose. Congress has effectively relied on this tacit, but independent, legal power for over two centuries.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This Article provides the first comprehensive account of the doctrine of federal incorporation and its current use, as well as an index of all federal corporations from the Founding to the present. In addition, this Article makes two important interventions. First, by clarifying the legal basis of federal incorporation, the existence of the charter power may offer alternative rationales for the constitutionality of federal legislation, alternatives to existing constructions of administrative law, and a coherent way to analyze large transactions which currently defy categorization. Second, as the current Court considers whether to invalidate existing jurisprudence which endorses “implied” rights, the existence of the charter power cuts against the theoretical case for doing so. Challenging the presumption against the legitimacy of unenumerated powers and rights, the charter power demonstrates that, in at least one case, a “silent” power is concrete, constrained, and original.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Article shows that Congress has an independent constitutional power to charter corporations. Because the word “corporation” is not in the Constitution, scholars have generally overlooked this power.<sup class="footnote" data-id="64"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-64" href="#post-4396-footnote-64">1&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-64" data-id="64"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>1.</span>See Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law 120–21, 155, 1846 (6th ed. 2020) (discussing <em>McCulloch v.

Maryland</em>, Chief Justice Marshall “decided . . . that Congress possesses the power . . . [of] chartering corporations” on bases other than the Necessary and Proper Clause. Charles L. Black, Jr., Structure and Relationship in Constitutional Law 14 (1969). Recently, scholars have stated that the corporate power exists and is constitutional but have not developed the point further. See, e.g., Nikolas Bowie, Corporate Personhood v. Corporate Statehood, 132 Harv. L. Rev. 2009, 2015 (2019) (reviewing Adam Winkler, We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights (2018)) (“Even though the U.S. Constitution didn’t mention corporations, members of all three of the federal government’s branches considered the power of incorporation such an inherent feature of sovereignty that they authorized Congress to charter corporations as the Constitution’s first implied power.”); see also Jonathan Gienapp, The Lost Constitution: The Rise and Fall of James Wilson’s and Gouverneur Morris’s Constitutionalism at the Founding 46 n.146 (Mar. 4, 2020) [hereinafter Gienapp, Lost Constitution] (unpublished manuscript) (on file with author) (“The real question . . . was whether it was politically useful to reinforce the already vested [incorporation] power through enumeration or not.” (citation omitted)); Robert J. Kaczorowski, Inherent National Sovereignty Constitutionalism: An Original Understanding of the U.S. Constitution, 101 Minn. L. Rev. 699, 701–02, 706 (2016) (describing incorporation as “one of [Congress’s] inherent sovereign powers”—evidence of a broader theory of constitutional understanding he argues existed in the early republic called “inherent national sovereignty constitutionalism”—but leaving ambiguous the scope, nature, number, independence, or possible contemporary applications of the powers that flow from this theory).As I discuss in Part II, a broad “sovereignty” argument is, on its own, insufficient to clear the hurdle of proving federal incorporation’s status as an autonomous constitutional power, not least because sovereignty itself was transformed by the change from the British to the American Constitution. Along similar lines, as I explain in Part III, the power was not “vested,” in the sense that it simply continued unabated, but had to be constructed by the Marshall Court. For the enumerated/unenumerated debate at the Founding generally, see Richard Primus, “The Essential Characteristic”: Enumerated Powers and the Bank of the United States, 117 Mich. L. Rev. 415, 417–26 (2018) [hereinafter Primus, Essential Characteristic].<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> Some go so far as to erroneously claim that “[a]s best we can tell, the people who wrote and ratified the Constitution simply never considered whether the Constitution applied to corporations.”<sup class="footnote" data-id="66"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-66" href="#post-4396-footnote-66">3&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-66" data-id="66"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>3.</span>Winkler, supra note 2, at 3; see also Jack N.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The legal costs of leaving the law of federal incorporation incoherent are wide-ranging and systemically significant. Among other problems, this incoherence contributed to the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis: not only did federal incorporation imply federal backing which, in turn, encouraged financial institutions to incorrectly price mortgage-backed securities, but the lack of clear legal rules governing this area of law also exacerbated the failure of public confidence in government that followed.<sup class="footnote" data-id="71"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-4396-footnote-71">8&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-71" data-id="71"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>8.</span>Additional problems are discussed later in the Introduction and in Section I.B.

It is important to note that federal incorporation was on both sides of the financial crisis: the federal takeover of General Motors transformed General Motors into a federal corporation because over fifty percent of the stock was held by the federal government. See 28 U.S.C. § 1349. For a discussion of the problems associated with the legality of the bailout, see Dennis K.

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a matter of constitutional theory, the costs are arguably even greater. In overturning <em>Roe v.

Bork to Be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: Hearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 100th Cong. 249 (1987) [hereinafter Bork Nomination] (statement of Hon. Robert H. Bork). The Ninth Amendment, of course, expressly contemplates unenumerated rights. U.S. Const. amend. IX. Importantly, powers are less limited by constitutional text than scholars often assume: Congress overwhelmingly voted against attaching “expressly” to “delegated” in the Tenth Amendment, clearly rejecting the Articles of Confederation’s prior restriction, by a vote of 32-17. U.S. Const. amend. X; 1 Annals of Cong. 797 (1789) (Joseph Gales ed., 1834); see also John Mikhail, Fixing Implied Constitutional Powers in the Founding Era, 34 Const.

They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013).Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan & Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power).

This Article does not highlight recent criticism of Chief Justice Marshall to the same extent as it does with Madison, however, because a chorus of historians agree that Madison was inconsistent both about enumeration and the Bank question—each of which directly affects how scholars have understood federal incorporation in particular. E.g., Mary Sarah Bilder, Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention 2 (2015) [hereinafter Bilder, Madison’s Hand]. By contrast, while there is no question Chief Justice Marshall was a Federalist, Witt, supra, there is also no clear evidence that he was judging in bad faith when he wrote <em>McCulloch</em>. See David S. Schwartz, Misreading <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, 18 U. Pa. J. Const.

Maryland</em> for its holding that the Bank of the United States was constitutional. In doing so, they treat <em>McCulloch</em> as a singular case: the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States is a stand-alone issue—not about the legal form of federal incorporation which created the Bank, but about the Bank as a <em>sui generis</em> creation—and the constitutionality of the question ultimately turns on the Necessary and Proper Clause, more or less alone.<sup class="footnote" data-id="95"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-95" href="#post-4396-footnote-95">32&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-95" data-id="95"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>32.</span>See, e.g., Chemerinsky, supra note 1, at 120–21, 155; Stone et al., supra note 1, at 66–68; Jeff Neal, McCulloch v.

<p style="text-align: justify;">But as Part III shows, <em>McCulloch</em> was only one pillar on which the early “canonical” case law of federal incorporation rested. More importantly, in constructing the corporate power, the Court was not inventing the law of federal incorporation or simply resolving the question of the Bank’s constitutionality. To the contrary, the Court was solving secondary problems related to the preexisting constitutional power of incorporation. Offering new readings of <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, <em>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</em>, and <em>Osborn v. Bank of the United States</em>, this Article shows how these cases operated as a trinity in which the Marshall Court organized how the national government’s power to create corporations—generally, not just the Bank specifically—would operate in the new federal system.<sup class="footnote" data-id="96"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-96" href="#post-4396-footnote-96">33&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-96" data-id="96"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>33.</span>See infra Part III. <em>Dartmouth</em> has, of course, long been read for the origins of the “private,” presumptively state-chartered, corporation.

Serv., RL30533, The Quasi Government: Hybrid Organizations with Both Government and Private Sector Legal Characteristics 1–10 (2011) (classifying forms of “hybrid organizations,” which are federal entities that have been assigned legal characteristics of both governmental and private sectors).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> This survey appears in Part I, thereby setting the stage for Parts II and III. As Part I demonstrates, the use of federal incorporation by both Congress and the executive has been important and continuous: in relying on the corporate power to this extent, Congress and the executive have demonstrated its constitutional existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simultaneously, however, in the absence of a clear understanding of the corporate power, judicial efforts to address federal incorporation have been incoherent. Part I shows why—despite the continuous reliance on the federal corporate form by Congress and the executive—existing legal understandings of that activity are inadequate. As Part I explains, the legal uncertainty that has defined federal incorporation in its modern form has, at times, made this device more valuable, not less. This Part shows how, as administrative- and private-law regimes grew increasingly organized and regulated in the twentieth century, the existence of a legal device which remained comparatively murky offered Congress and the executive branch valuable legal and financial flexibility. Not inconsequentially, this meant that a range of actors had little incentive to clarify this field of law.<sup class="footnote" data-id="106"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-106" href="#post-4396-footnote-106">43&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-106" data-id="106"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>43.</span>See infra Subsection I.A.1. For instance, federal incorporation can allow Congress to engage in off-budget accounting. See United States ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. McCarl, 275 U.S. 1, 8 (1927) (“[A]n important if not the chief reason for employing these incorporated agencies was to enable them to employ commercial methods and to conduct their operations with a freedom supposed to be inconsistent with accountability to the Treasury under its established procedure of audit and control over the financial transactions of the United States.” (citation omitted)).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs of leaving the corporate power inchoate counsel against leaving it as it stands. As Part I argues, the legal ambiguity around federal incorporation in the aggregate has come at a cost to constitutional coherence and legitimacy, outweighing the legal and financial flexibility that the uncertainty of the corporate power has sometimes enabled. Part I outlines those costs. First, the corporate power’s indeterminacy encourages large actors to use privatization or public backing to escape the constraints of either public or private law—encouraging financial boom-bust cycles and corroding public trust.<sup class="footnote" data-id="107"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-107" href="#post-4396-footnote-107">44&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-107" data-id="107"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>44.</span>Metzger, supra note 5, at 1370–71; Government by Contract, supra note 5, at 3; Berman, supra note 8; Zaring, supra note 8, at 1406–08; see infra Subsection I.B.2.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> Second, confusion about the status of federal incorporation may lead the current Court to mistake legitimate federal corporate activity for “illegitimate” administrative action as it continues to redefine various aspects of administrative law.<sup class="footnote" data-id="108"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-108" href="#post-4396-footnote-108">45&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-108" data-id="108"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>45.</span>See infra Paragraph I.B.2.ii.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> Third, in the twenty-first century, Congress has increasingly engaged in large transactions, which are difficult to reconcile with and may disrupt existing fields of law, ranging from the 2008 financial bailout to the Puerto Rican debt crisis to the recent Oxycontin settlement.<sup class="footnote" data-id="109"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-109" href="#post-4396-footnote-109">46&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-109" data-id="109"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>46.</span>Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, 12 U.S.C. §§ 4501–4642; Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”), 48 U.S.C. §§ 2101–2241; Press Release, Off. of Pub.

Part I argues that these transactions are the latest “generation” in federal corporate activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the charter power thus established in Parts I, II, and III, Part IV makes two interventions. Section IV.A shows how we might develop an understanding of federal incorporation as positive law, independent from the administrative-, legislative-, and private-law categories scholars have previously struggled to reconcile out of necessity. Once we recognize that the corporate power is a stand-alone constitutional power, we can begin to describe its legal particulars, just like any other independent power or right. Federal corporations differ from state corporations and federal agencies in important ways. Among other things, federal corporations allow the federal government to craft a corporate form that includes the kind of substantive, not economic, rules that regulatory agencies are currently prohibited from imposing on state-chartered corporations.<sup class="footnote" data-id="110"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-110" href="#post-4396-footnote-110">47&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-110" data-id="110"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>47.</span>E.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs. v.

See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 161–62 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Marcel Kahan & Edward B. Rock, When the Government Is the Controlling Shareholder, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 1293, 1295 (2011); Steven M. Davidoff & David Zaring, Regulation by Deal: The Government’s Response to the Financial Crisis, 61 Admin. L. Rev. 463, 465 (2009). Also, forced consolidation resulted in the Railway Express Agency. See infra Appendix. This Article leaves these questions for future work to discuss in full.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drawing on Parts II and III, Section IV.A also offers three new tools for courts and scholars focused on contemporary doctrine: (1) clarity with respect to threshold questions such as when a federal corporation has “private” status; (2) an alternative justification for federal legislation that engages in financial activity, broadly defined;<sup class="footnote" data-id="113"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-113" href="#post-4396-footnote-113">50&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-113" data-id="113"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>50.</span>For example, rather than relying on the Commerce Clause, the spending power, or the tax power, courts might find legislation like the Affordable Care Act constitutional because this legislation creates a federal corporation. See infra Paragraph I.B.2.iii.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> and (3) a category of analysis which remains bounded by constitutional restrictions but rests outside of usual administrative-law rules. As Part I details, the Court has signaled that it may revisit federal corporation law as part of its general reconsideration of administrative law.<sup class="footnote" data-id="114"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-114" href="#post-4396-footnote-114">51&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-114" data-id="114"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>51.</span>See infra Paragraph I.B.2.ii.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> A clear understanding of federal incorporation may prove important if it does so, not least because federal corporate activity may intersect with the rapidly changing landscape of Appointments Clause jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Section IV.B discusses the theoretical implications of the corporate power, or where we might go “beyond” enumerationism. It is beyond the scope of this Article to answer whether or not there are more silent powers or rights in the Constitution. This Article also does not contend that the mere presence of one unenumerated power means that all other unenumerated rights or powers are suddenly doctrinally unimpeachable. Nevertheless, the fact of the corporate power has several important methodological implications for how we think about constitutional interpretation generally—and for how we address “silent” rights and powers in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The corporate power’s existence challenges the current supremacy of certain styles of textualism and originalism, not least because the fact of the corporate power demonstrates how ineffective these approaches have been at ensuring either legal stability or democratic transparency. Even as Congress has become so reliant on this “silent” power that our economy is systemically interwoven with it, our law has been unable to effectively cognize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This oversight is, in part, due to a long textualist tradition of equating constitutional rights and powers with single-clause labels. This tradition has venerable roots: among other sources, it sprang from the transformative mid-century First Amendment fundamentalism of Justice Black.<sup class="footnote" data-id="115"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-115" href="#post-4396-footnote-115">52&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-115" data-id="115"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>52.</span>See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 508–09 (1965) (Black, J., dissenting). Justice Black’s dissent was based on his opposition to the resurrection of the “ordered liberty” test that <em>Dobbs</em> relies on. Id. at 526 n.21 (“[C]ases applying specific Bill of Rights provisions to the States do not in my view stand for the proposition that this Court can rely on its own concept of ‘ordered liberty’ or ‘shocking the conscience’ or natural law to decide what laws it will permit state legislatures to enact.” (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963))). Justice Black’s worry about “ordered liberty” stemmed from not only his commitment to the hard-won First Amendment rights his fundamentalism protected, id. at 509 (“One of the most effective ways of diluting . . . a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning.”), but also the possibility that incorporation—extending federal constitutional rights to protect Americans against state overreach, which he supported—would be diluted if it were conflated with the “ordered liberty” test. Id. In short, he appears to have feared that <em>Griswold</em>’s embrace of unenumerated rights would require legal logic that would, in turn, call into question the incorporation of First Amendment rights he had made his life’s work.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> But the corporate power demonstrates that textualism—and indeed, interpretation that, like Black’s, takes rights and powers seriously—must be distinguished from mere taxonomy to remain coherent. Specifically, this Article shows that the tradition of unenumerated interpretation which the corporate power demonstrates cuts against the presumption against unenumerated rights that the Court relied on, for example, in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>.<sup class="footnote" data-id="116"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-116" href="#post-4396-footnote-116">53&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-116" data-id="116"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>53.</span>See infra Subsection IV.B.2.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> The corporate power also suggests that there is firmer existing interpretive ground for unenumerated law than we have previously considered possible. The drafting approaches of the Framers detailed here—what is usually referred to as the “structuralism” of the Marshall Court, and what we might term the “interprovision interpretation” of the Warren Court—indicate as much.<sup class="footnote" data-id="117"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-117" href="#post-4396-footnote-117">54&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-117" data-id="117"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>54.</span>For the canonical statement of “structural interpretation,” see Black, supra note 2, at 7.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> This interpretive unity transcends disagreements about Federalist politics and the particular legal climate of the 1960s and deserves further attention on its own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Article also contributes to debate over how we should think about the relationship between history and law today. In part because of the increasingly long shadow originalism casts, legal scholars have recently tended in either originalist or realist directions when engaging with the history of the Constitution.<sup class="footnote" data-id="118"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-118" href="#post-4396-footnote-118">55&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-118" data-id="118"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>55.</span>For a helpful survey of originalism, see Gregory Ablavsky, Akhil Amar’s Unusable Past, 121 Mich. L. Rev. 1119, 1119–27 (2023) (reviewing Akhil Reed Amar, The Words That Made Us: America’s Constitutional Conversation, 1760–1840 (2021)). For an example of realism, see, e.g., Ryan D. Doerfler & Samuel Moyn, The Constitution Is Broken and Should Not Be Reclaimed, N.Y. Times (Aug. 19, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/opinion/liber‌als-constitution.html (urging a shift away from constitutional law and toward “ordinary expressions of popular will”); Sanford Levinson, What Is This Project, Anyway?, Democracy J., Summer 2021, https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/61/what-is-this-project-anyway/ [https://perma.cc/9R2S-C8DM] (describing the Constitution as “a clear and present danger” and proposing significant reforms).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> This has had the side effect of causing legal scholarship to address the distinction between law and politics in one of two ways. Both approaches elide the law-politics distinction. Original meaning attempts to “democratize” originalism by assuming that there is no distinction between the two in a positive manner.<sup class="footnote" data-id="119"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-119" href="#post-4396-footnote-119">56&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-119" data-id="119"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>56.</span>See infra Subsection IV.B.1. This effort is not limited to the Founding: renewed interest in “popular constitutionalism” has encouraged scholars to search for public-legal fusion across American history. For a recent example, see Joseph Fishkin & William E. Forbath, The Anti-Oligarchy Constitution: Reconstructing the Economic Foundations of American Democracy 484–87 (2022).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> Conversely, those favoring a realist approach—rightly refusing to ignore evidence of political disagreement in the past—often conclude from this disagreement that no clear legal meaning can be found.<sup class="footnote" data-id="120"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-120" href="#post-4396-footnote-120">57&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-120" data-id="120"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>57.</span>See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., The Chimerical Concept of Original Public Meaning, 107 Va. L. Rev. 1421, 1427 (2021) (positing that original public meanings “are insufficient to resolve any historically contested or otherwise reasonably disputable issue”); Gienapp, Second Creation, supra note 10, at 1–12 (arguing against the concept of a “fixed” Constitution).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> What is lost is the reality of historical friction between law and politics. This, in turn, endangers the possibility that accurate historical work might coexist with positive legal argument.<sup class="footnote" data-id="121"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-121" href="#post-4396-footnote-121">58&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-121" data-id="121"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>58.</span>For a discussion of further implications, see infra Subsection IV.B.1.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> The corporate power is evidence of the kind of collateral damage that can occur when we are limited to realist or originalist perspectives: if we fully commit to either at the expense of contradictory evidence, we would be unable to explain its presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond the remit of these methodological considerations, contemporary doctrine and legal theory alike have important interpretive conventions which presume against the possibility that legal meaning might be hidden in some sense.<sup class="footnote" data-id="122"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-122" href="#post-4396-footnote-122">59&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-122" data-id="122"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>59.</span>These interpretive conventions fall into roughly two groups: interpretive conventions about legibility, such as statutory canons and constitutional interpretation, and statutory disclosure rules.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> These conventions spring from a deep-rooted understanding, shared by both the public and experts, that the legitimacy of American law depends upon it remaining democratically accountable.<sup class="footnote" data-id="123"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-123" href="#post-4396-footnote-123">60&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-123" data-id="123"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>60.</span>The Constitution’s brevity, textual nature, and pre-ratification discussion in the press, usually framed in contrast to British constitutional law, have long been taken to mean that we should understand the Constitution as animated by values of legibility. In <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, Chief Justice Marshall himself argues that the Constitution does not exhibit the “prolixity of a legal code” because if it did “[i]t would probably never be understood by the public.” 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407 (1819). Importantly, however, Chief Justice Marshall relies on this lack of prolixity as one of several reasons that the corporate power is clearly in the Constitution. See id. at 410–24.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> For this reason, more than any other, it may be tempting to assume that there cannot be a “silent” constitutional power. Part IV addresses possible criticisms of the interpretation this Article lays out, explaining how the fact that the corporate power exists does not legitimate “secret deals” or find “elephants in mouseholes.”<sup class="footnote" data-id="124"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-124" href="#post-4396-footnote-124">61&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-left note-124" data-id="124"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>61.</span>Among other things, statutory conventions which require clarity in specific ways do not automatically apply to constitutional law. Scholars have, for other reasons, suggested we see the ways in which constitutional law is similar to legislation. See, e.g., Farah Peterson, Expounding the Constitution, 130 Yale L.J. 2, 7 (2020). But in important ways, constitutional law is also a distinct topic—with its own rules of interpretation as a result. For one example of constitutional law’s singularity, see David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 886 (2016).<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> To the contrary, it is not by recognizing, but by continuing to overlook the corporate power that legal analysis has failed to constrain it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In sum, this Article offers important evidence that an interpretive approach focused on discrete, individual, yet unnamed powers (or rights) might lead to more robust and actionable insights than we have previously thought. It calls into question the ongoing presumption that unenumerated rights and powers are inherently suspect or political.<sup class="footnote" data-id="125"><a id="post-4396-footnote-ref-125" href="#post-4396-footnote-125">62&nbsp;</a></sup><span class="foot-ref note-right note-125" data-id="125"><span class="foot-ref-inner"><span>62.</span>As discussed in Part IV, there are, of course, important doctrinal distinctions that may be made between different unenumerated rights and powers. In this sense, the corporate power stands on its own.<a href="#" class="show-more">Show More</a></span></span> And most importantly, it shows that such rights and powers are not merely “aspirational”—nor do they live only as lost historical alternatives. They are present in the law right now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Article proceeds in four parts. Part I lays out the existing law of federal incorporation, explains how transactions may also be understood as corporations, and shows how the indeterminacy created by the current law’s contradictions undermines the legitimacy of federal corporate activity, resulting in significant legal costs, not just political and financial costs. Part II describes the original drafting of the charter power, addressing the debate over whether the corporate power was originally in the Constitution and on what basis. Part III describes the Marshall Court doctrine that constructed the power: <em>McCulloch</em>, <em>Dartmouth</em>, and <em>Osborn</em>. Part IV first details what implications a revived corporate power has for both considering and constructing federal corporations today; second, it explains how understanding the corporate power affects wider constitutional debates about implied powers and rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Article also provides a list of existing chartered corporations in the Appendix, something that has not been attempted in several decades. Due to the nature of existing records and legal ambiguity, this list cannot be definitive; it errs on the side of inclusivity. This list is a “living” one, designed to be updated periodically.</p>

Black, Jr., Structure and Relationship in Constitutional Law 14 (1969). Recently, scholars have stated that the corporate power exists and is constitutional but have not developed the point further. See, e.g., Nikolas Bowie, Corporate Personhood v. Corporate Statehood, 132 Harv. L. Rev. 2009, 2015 (2019) (reviewing Adam Winkler, We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights (2018)) (“Even though the U.S. Constitution didn’t mention corporations, members of all three of the federal government’s branches considered the power of incorporation such an inherent feature of sovereignty that they authorized Congress to charter corporations as the Constitution’s first implied power.”); see also Jonathan Gienapp, The Lost Constitution: The Rise and Fall of James Wilson’s and Gouverneur Morris’s Constitutionalism at the Founding 46 n.146 (Mar. 4, 2020) [hereinafter Gienapp, Lost Constitution] (unpublished manuscript) (on file with author) (“The real question . . . was whether it was politically useful to reinforce the already vested [incorporation] power through enumeration or not.” (citation omitted)); Robert J.

<p>As I discuss in Part II, a broad “sovereignty” argument is, on its own, insufficient to clear the hurdle of proving federal incorporation’s status as an autonomous constitutional power, not least because sovereignty itself was transformed by the change from the British to the American Constitution. Along similar lines, as I explain in Part III, the power was not “vested,” in the sense that it simply continued unabated, but had to be constructed by the Marshall Court.

<li id="post-4396-footnote-17" style="text-align: justify;"> “Constructions” or “conventions” refer to authoritative ideas and lenses which solve for constitutional confusion and may have become law-like over time. They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013).
<p>Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan &amp; Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power). See also Jonathan Gienapp, The Myth of the Constitutional Given: Enumeration and National Power at the Founding, 69 Am. U. L. Rev. F. 183, 193, 207 (2020) [hereinafter Gienapp, Myth] (arguing that the General Welfare Clause and the Preamble were meant to be active clauses as part of a “Wilsonian” understanding of the Constitution). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-17">↑</a></li>

This Article argues in Parts II and III that, whether or not this was the case, the legally predictable outcome of this approach—one which would have been clear to most lawyers at the time—was that the corporate power was enforceable.

This Article does not highlight recent criticism of Chief Justice Marshall to the same extent as it does with Madison, however, because a chorus of historians agree that Madison was inconsistent both about enumeration and the Bank question—each of which directly affects how scholars have understood federal incorporation in particular. E.g., Mary Sarah Bilder, Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention 2 (2015) [hereinafter Bilder, Madison’s Hand]. By contrast, while there is no question Chief Justice Marshall was a Federalist, Witt, supra, there is also no clear evidence that he was judging in bad faith when he wrote <em>McCulloch</em>.

(forthcoming) (manuscript at 26–27), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4869528 [https://perma.cc/Y‌Q2N-BCJB] (describing institutional design through the courts but driven by private litigants that defies existing categories, similar to that analyzed here). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-46">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-47" style="text-align: justify;"> E.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs. v. SEC, 800 F.3d 518, 520–22 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) cannot require companies to adhere to certain disclosure requirements). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-47">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-48" style="text-align: justify;"> See infra Appendix. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-48">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-49" style="text-align: justify;"> There are also important questions about when and whether federal corporations (or the federal government) can take over existing corporations as well and what occurs when they do. See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 161–62 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Marcel Kahan &amp; Edward B. Rock, When the Government Is the Controlling Shareholder, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 1293, 1295 (2011); Steven M. Davidoff &amp; David Zaring, Regulation by Deal: The Government’s Response to the Financial Crisis, 61 Admin. L. Rev. 463, 465 (2009). Also, forced consolidation resulted in the Railway Express Agency. See infra Appendix. This Article leaves these questions for future work to discuss in full. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-49">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-50" style="text-align: justify;"> For example, rather than relying on the Commerce Clause, the spending power, or the tax power, courts might find legislation like the Affordable Care Act constitutional because this legislation creates a federal corporation. See infra Paragraph I.B.2.iii. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-50">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-51" style="text-align: justify;"> See infra Paragraph I.B.2.ii. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-51">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-52" style="text-align: justify;"> See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 508–09 (1965) (Black, J., dissenting). Justice Black’s dissent was based on his opposition to the resurrection of the “ordered liberty” test that <em>Dobbs</em> relies on. Id. at 526 n.21 (“[C]ases applying specific Bill of Rights provisions to the States do not in my view stand for the proposition that this Court can rely on its own concept of ‘ordered liberty’ or ‘shocking the conscience’ or natural law to decide what laws it will permit state legislatures to enact.” (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963))). Justice Black’s worry about “ordered liberty” stemmed from not only his commitment to the hard-won First Amendment rights his fundamentalism protected, id. at 509 (“One of the most effective ways of diluting . . . a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning.”), but also the possibility that incorporation—extending federal constitutional rights to protect Americans against state overreach, which he supported—would be diluted if it were conflated with the “ordered liberty” test. Id. In short, he appears to have feared that <em>Griswold</em>’s embrace of unenumerated rights would require legal logic that would, in turn, call into question the incorporation of First Amendment rights he had made his life’s work. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-52">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-53" style="text-align: justify;"> See infra Subsection IV.B.2. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-53">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-54" style="text-align: justify;"> For the canonical statement of “structural interpretation,” see Black, supra note 2, at 7. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-54">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-55" style="text-align: justify;"> For a helpful survey of originalism, see Gregory Ablavsky, Akhil Amar’s Unusable Past, 121 Mich. L. Rev. 1119, 1119–27 (2023) (reviewing Akhil Reed Amar, The Words That Made Us: America’s Constitutional Conversation, 1760–1840 (2021)). For an example of realism, see, e.g., Ryan D. Doerfler &amp; Samuel Moyn, The Constitution Is Broken and Should Not Be Reclaimed, N.Y. Times (Aug. 19, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/opinion/liber‌als-constitution.html (urging a shift away from constitutional law and toward “ordinary expressions of popular will”); Sanford Levinson, What Is This Project, Anyway?, Democracy J., Summer 2021, https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/61/what-is-this-project-anyway/ [https://perma.cc/9R2S-C8DM] (describing the Constitution as “a clear and present danger” and proposing significant reforms). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-55">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-56" style="text-align: justify;"> See infra Subsection IV.B.1. This effort is not limited to the Founding: renewed interest in “popular constitutionalism” has encouraged scholars to search for public-legal fusion across American history. For a recent example, see Joseph Fishkin &amp; William E. Forbath, The Anti-Oligarchy Constitution: Reconstructing the Economic Foundations of American Democracy 484–87 (2022). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-56">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-57" style="text-align: justify;"> See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., The Chimerical Concept of Original Public Meaning, 107 Va. L. Rev. 1421, 1427 (2021) (positing that original public meanings “are insufficient to resolve any historically contested or otherwise reasonably disputable issue”); Gienapp, Second Creation, supra note 10, at 1–12 (arguing against the concept of a “fixed” Constitution). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-57">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-58" style="text-align: justify;"> For a discussion of further implications, see infra Subsection IV.B.1. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-58">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-59" style="text-align: justify;"> These interpretive conventions fall into roughly two groups: interpretive conventions about legibility, such as statutory canons and constitutional interpretation, and statutory disclosure rules. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-59">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-60" style="text-align: justify;"> The Constitution’s brevity, textual nature, and pre-ratification discussion in the press, usually framed in contrast to British constitutional law, have long been taken to mean that we should understand the Constitution as animated by values of legibility. In <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, Chief Justice Marshall himself argues that the Constitution does not exhibit the “prolixity of a legal code” because if it did “[i]t would probably never be understood by the public.” 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407 (1819). Importantly, however, Chief Justice Marshall relies on this lack of prolixity as one of several reasons that the corporate power is clearly in the Constitution. See id. at 410–24. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-60">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-61" style="text-align: justify;"> Among other things, statutory conventions which require clarity in specific ways do not automatically apply to constitutional law. Scholars have, for other reasons, suggested we see the ways in which constitutional law is similar to legislation. See, e.g., Farah Peterson, Expounding the Constitution, 130 Yale L.J. 2, 7 (2020). But in important ways, constitutional law is also a distinct topic—with its own rules of interpretation as a result. For one example of constitutional law’s singularity, see David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 886 (2016). <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-61">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-4396-footnote-62">
<p style="text-align: justify;"> As discussed in Part IV, there are, of course, important doctrinal distinctions that may be made between different unenumerated rights and powers. In this sense, the corporate power stands on its own. <a href="#post-4396-footnote-ref-62">↑</a></p>
