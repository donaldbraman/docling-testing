Marriage equality has swept America. Numerous federal judges, including Western District of Wisconsin Judge Barbara Crabb, have invalidated state proscriptions on same-sex marriage. This paper scrutinizes U.S. litigation, Crabb’s opinion, Seventh Circuit affirmance, and Supreme Court resolution. Finding that Wisconsin shows how to efficaciously institute full marriage equality, even as other states have not, the piece affords future suggestions." />

<p>Marriage equality has swept America. Numerous federal judges, including Western District of Wisconsin Judge Barbara Crabb, have invalidated state proscriptions on same-sex marriage. This paper scrutinizes U.S. litigation, Crabb’s opinion, Seventh Circuit affirmance, and Supreme Court resolution. Finding that Wisconsin shows how to efficaciously institute full marriage equality, even as other states have not, the piece affords future suggestions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">II. Wisconsin Litigation</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><em>A. District Court</em></h3>
<p>In February 2014, plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin’s laws, and that June, Judge Barbara Crabb invalidated them in <em>Wolf v. Walker</em>. <a id="ref-14" href="#note-14"><sup title="986 F. Supp. 2d 982 (W.D. Wis. 2014).">14</sup></a> The parties agreed that marriage is central to society, which she linked with “our sense of self, personal autonomy and public dignity.” <a id="ref-15" href="#note-15"><sup title=" Id. at 987.">15</sup></a> This required scrutiny to ascertain whether the bans violated constitutional guarantees, which prompted her conclusion that “defendants are . . . denying equal citizenship to plaintiffs” by not allowing their marriage. <a id="ref-16" href="#note-16"><sup title="Id. (“[M]arriage is not merely an accumulation of benefits. It is a fundamental mark of citizenship.” (quoting Andrew Sullivan, State of the Union, New Republic (May 8, 2000), http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/75716/state-the-union)).">16</sup></a> When the state deprives a whole “class of citizens of a right as fundamental as marriage,” it must at least show that this advances a legitimate interest apart from a desire to maintain the status quo. <a id="ref-17" href="#note-17"><sup title="Id. at 987–88 (“[P]ersonal beliefs, anxiety about change and discomfort about an unfamiliar way of life must give way to a respect for the constitutional rights of individuals . . . .”).">17</sup></a></p>
<p>Crabb found “[un]persuasive” arguments to immunize the ban from review. <em>Baker v. Nelson </em><a id="ref-18" href="#note-18"><sup title="409 U.S. 810 (1972) (summarily dismissing “for want of a substantial federal question”).">18</sup></a> was not controlling when later doctrinal developments made it suspect, <a id="ref-19" href="#note-19"><sup title="Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 988–91.">19</sup></a> as the Court “has denounced the view implicit in cases such as <em>Baker</em> that gay persons are ‘strangers to the law.’” <a id="ref-20" href="#note-20"><sup title="Id. at 990–91 (citing United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003); Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996)). “To the extent Romer and Lawrence left any room for doubt whether the claims in this case raise a substantial federal question, that doubt was resolved in United States v. Windsor . . . .” Id. at 990 (citation omitted).">20</sup></a> She analyzed the idea that judges should not question state voters’ decisions about whether and when to permit same-sex marriage <a id="ref-21" href="#note-21"><sup title="Id. at 993–97. Wisconsin based this on federalism and marriage regulation as a traditional state matter. Id. at 994.">21</sup></a> but decided that a general federalism interest, although important, could not trump the Fourteenth Amendment, <a id="ref-22" href="#note-22"><sup title="Id. “States may not ‘experiment’ with different social policies by violating constitutional rights.” Id.">22</sup></a> which grants federal courts well-established power to determine whether state laws violate individuals’ constitutional rights. <a id="ref-23" href="#note-23"><sup title="Id. She said that the Court in Windsor used “DOMA’s encroachment on state authority as evidence that the law was unconstitutional,” id. at 997, and Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 134 S. Ct. 1623 (2014), “said nothing about state laws . . . that require discrimination.” Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 996.">23</sup></a></p>
<p>Crabb assessed the review standard for whether bans denied a fundamental due process right to marry and equal protection by discriminating against plaintiffs on “the basis of sex and sexual orientation.” <a id="ref-24" href="#note-24"><sup title="Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 997. Each clause poses review standard issues, and the rights that each insures “frequently overlap.” Id. at 997 (quoting Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 953 (Mass. 2003)).">24</sup></a> She asserted, “The ‘liberty’ protected by the due process clause . . . includes the ‘fundamental right’ to marry, a conclusion that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed many times.” <a id="ref-25" href="#note-25"><sup title="Id. at 997–98 (collecting cases).">25</sup></a> The Justices have stated that “‘[w]hen a statutory classification significantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right’ . . . the law ‘cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.’” <a id="ref-26" href="#note-26"><sup title="Id. at 998 (first alteration in original) (quoting Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 388 (1978)).">26</sup></a> Crabb analyzed the right’s scope, asking whether the “wish to marry someone of the same-sex falls within the right to marry already firmly established in Supreme Court precedent,” finding it does. <a id="ref-27" href="#note-27"><sup title="Id. at 998–99.">27</sup></a> She treated marriage’s purposes, rejecting procreation as the sole reason for constitutional protection, since the Supreme Court has never made this a requirement. <a id="ref-28" href="#note-28"><sup title="Id. at 999.">28</sup></a> Because the state offered no reason that same-sex couples cannot fulfill marriage’s purposes “just as well as opposite-sex couples,” Crabb interpreted the right to include same-sex marriage <a id="ref-29" href="#note-29"><sup title="Id. at 1000.">29</sup></a> and concluded the issue is whether a right exists “from which same-sex couples can be excluded.” <a id="ref-30" href="#note-30"><sup title="Id. at 1001.">30</sup></a></p>
<p>She addressed the claim that same-sex marriage’s inclusion would contradict <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em>, <a id="ref-31" href="#note-31"><sup title="521 U.S. 702 (1997).">31</sup></a> in which the Court “stated that its substantive-due-process jurisprudence . . . has been a process whereby the outlines of the liberty specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . . . have . . . been carefully refined by concrete examples involving fundamental rights found to be deeply rooted in our legal tradition.” <a id="ref-32" href="#note-32"><sup title="Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 1001–02 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722) (internal quotation marks omitted).">32</sup></a> Crabb had difficulty squaring that case with two in which the “Court recognized . . . rights . . . [not] ‘deeply rooted’ in the country’s legal tradition at the time.” <a id="ref-33" href="#note-33"><sup title="Id. at 1002 (citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)).">33</sup></a> She found that <em>Glucksberg</em> “involved the question whether a right to engage in certain conduct . . . should be expanded to include a right to engage in different conduct,” <a id="ref-34" href="#note-34"><sup title="Id.">34</sup></a> whereas “the conduct at issue [in <em>Wolf</em>] [wa]s exactly the same as that already protected: getting married.” <a id="ref-35" href="#note-35"><sup title="Id.">35</sup></a> Crabb said two major cases show “that the state cannot rely on a history of exclusion to narrow the scope of [a] right,” <a id="ref-36" href="#note-36"><sup title="Id. (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)).">36</sup></a> which “must be framed in neutral terms to prevent arbitrary exclusions of entire classes of people,” <a id="ref-37" href="#note-37"><sup title="Id. at 1003.">37</sup></a> and history is not determinative, especially given more recent legal and societal changes. <a id="ref-38" href="#note-38"><sup title="Id.; see Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 572 (“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.” (alteration in original) (quoting Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 857 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring))).">38</sup></a> She concluded that Wisconsin laws interfere significantly with the right to marry, so they required support in “sufficiently important state interests . . . closely tailored to effectuate only these interests.” <a id="ref-39" href="#note-39"><sup title="Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 1006 (quoting Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 388 (1978)).">39</sup></a></p>
<p>Crabb treated the equal protection claim, <a id="ref-40" href="#note-40"><sup title="She did so because defendants would probably appeal. Id.">40</sup></a> saying that “[m]ost classifications must be upheld against [an] equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.” <a id="ref-41" href="#note-41"><sup title="Id. at 1007 (quoting FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted).">41</sup></a> However, elevated review may apply. <a id="ref-42" href="#note-42"><sup title="Id.">42</sup></a> For a “suspect” classification, the Supreme Court uses “strict scrutiny,” which requires that states show the classification is “narrowly tailored” to attain a “compelling” interest. <a id="ref-43" href="#note-43"><sup title=" Id. (quoting Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007); Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976)).">43</sup></a> For others, namely gender, the Justices employ “intermediate scrutiny,” so “classifications must be substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective.” <a id="ref-44" href="#note-44"><sup title="Id. (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 524 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).">44</sup></a></p>
<p>Plaintiffs argued for elevated scrutiny, as the ban discriminates based on sex and sexual orientation. <a id="ref-45" href="#note-45"><sup title="Id.">45</sup></a> Because the Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit had not endorsed the first, Crabb eschewed it. <a id="ref-46" href="#note-46"><sup title="Id. at 1007–09.">46</sup></a> As to sexual orientation discrimination, she found that the Supreme Court has never explicitly applied heightened review, but some assert that two cases show it uses elevated review. <a id="ref-47" href="#note-47"><sup title="Id. at 1009–10. Absent clearer guidance, it was difficult to rely on Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), or United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), to apply that scrutiny. Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 1010–11.">47</sup></a> Crabb, thus, assessed the criteria that the Justices apply: “(1) whether the class has been subjected to a history of discrimination; (2) whether individuals in the class are able to contribute to society to the same extent as others; (3) whether the characteristic defining the class is immutable; and (4) whether the class is politically powerless.” <a id="ref-48" href="#note-48"><sup title="Wolf, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 1012 (citations omitted) (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440–41 (1985); Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313). She said all courts considering the issue since Windsor found that each “applies to sexual orientation discrimination.” Id. at 1012 (citations omitted). Defendants did not contest the first two. Id.">48</sup></a> She analyzed immutability, deeming sexual orientation basic to a person’s identity, even if not immutable. <a id="ref-49" href="#note-49"><sup title="Id. at 1013.">49</sup></a> Crabb found that the last criterion was not relevant; <a id="ref-50" href="#note-50"><sup title="Id. at 1013–14.">50</sup></a> the idea “would be challenging to apply” and “it is difficult to understand why a group’s political power should be determinative.” <a id="ref-51" href="#note-51"><sup title="Id. at 1014.">51</sup></a> Insofar as the concept is pertinent, she thought it best stated “as whether the class is inherently vulnerable in the context of the ordinary political process, either because of its size or history of disenfranchisement.” <a id="ref-52" href="#note-52"><sup title="Id.">52</sup></a> Given “that gay persons make up only a small percentage of the population and that there is no dispute that they have been subjected to a history of discrimination,” Crabb easily concluded that this factor was met. <a id="ref-53" href="#note-53"><sup title="Id.">53</sup></a></p>
<p>In short, sexual orientation discrimination received elevated scrutiny but was most akin to sex among the classifications with this protection. <a id="ref-54" href="#note-54"><sup title="Id. (“The Supreme Court has not explained how to distinguish a ‘suspect’ classification from a ‘quasi-suspect’ classification, but sexual orientation is most similar to sex among the different classifications that receive heightened protection.” (citation omitted)).">54</sup></a> “Because sex discrimination receives intermediate scrutiny and the difference between intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny is not dispositive,” she used intermediate scrutiny, so Wisconsin had to show that its ban was substantially related to attaining an important state goal. <a id="ref-55" href="#note-55"><sup title="Id.">55</sup></a> Crabb, thus, assessed whether the state had shown that the ban furthers a legitimate purpose and found that the interests advanced were like those urged by jurisdictions in other ban cases and the DOMA defenders <a id="ref-56" href="#note-56"><sup title="Id. at 1017.">56</sup></a> in <em>Windsor </em>that the Supreme Court did not credit. <a id="ref-57" href="#note-57"><sup title="Id. “[T]he Court stated that ‘no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2696 (2013)).">57</sup></a> However, deciding whether <em>Windsor</em> controlled was unnecessary because defendants “failed to show that the ban furthers a legitimate state interest.” <a id="ref-58" href="#note-58"><sup title="Id. at 1018. Similarly, the level of scrutiny applied did not matter because Crabb concluded that the marriage ban failed constitutional review under the equal protection clause regardless of what level of scrutiny she applied. Id. at 1016.">58</sup></a></p>
<p>She then reviewed Wisconsin’s interests. Crabb first explored tradition, which “can be important because it often reflects lessons of experience,” <a id="ref-59" href="#note-59"><sup title="Id. at 1018 (quoting Brief of Amici Curiae Julaine K. Appling, Jo Egelhoff, Jaren E. Hiller, Richard Kessenich &amp; Edmund L. Webster at 7, Wolf v. Walker, 986 F. Supp. 2d 982 (W.D. Wis. 2014) (No. 14-cv-64)) (internal quotation marks omitted).">59</sup></a> but deemed critical the reasons underlying traditions and that courts must decide whether they satisfy equal protection. <a id="ref-60" href="#note-60"><sup title="Id. The U.S. has rejected “darker traditions,” namely slavery, as denials of equality. Id. at 1019.">60</sup></a> Traditions also “may endure because of unexamined assumptions about a particular class of people rather than because the laws serve the community as a whole,” <a id="ref-61" href="#note-61"><sup title=" Id.">61</sup></a> prompting the Supreme Court to say that the “[a]ncient lineage of a legal concept does not give it immunity from attack for lacking a rational basis.” <a id="ref-62" href="#note-62"><sup title=" Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 326 (1993)).">62</sup></a> “Thus, if blind adherence to the past is the only justification for the law, it must fail.” <a id="ref-63" href="#note-63"><sup title="Id. at 1020 (citing O.

<p>The third was optimal child rearing, which the judge found experts and jurists have seriously questioned and conflicts with the second. <a id="ref-67" href="#note-67"><sup title="Id. at 1022.">67</sup></a> Even if courts “assume that children fare better with two biological parents,” four reasons undercut the idea. <a id="ref-68" href="#note-68"><sup title="Id. at 1023.">68</sup></a> First, it was “another incredibly underinclusive argument.” <a id="ref-69" href="#note-69"><sup title="Id.">69</sup></a> “Second, even if being raised by two biological parents provides the ‘optimal’ environment on average, this would not necessarily justify a discriminatory law.” <a id="ref-70" href="#note-70"><sup title="Id.

<p>The major focus was “the states’ arguments, which [we]re based largely on the assertion that banning same-sex marriage is justified by the state’s interest in channeling procreative sex into (necessarily heterosexual) marriage,” and he engaged the “arguments on their own terms,” <a id="ref-88" href="#note-88"><sup title="Id. at 655.

<p>Some are concerned that marriage equality could violate ban proponents’ religious liberty.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, and Wisconsin figured prominently in that effort. Judge Crabb’s careful invalidation of the state’s constitutional ban, her decision’s affirmance by the Seventh Circuit, and <em>Obergefell</em> brought full marriage equality to Wisconsin before numerous states. Thus, jurisdictions that have not experienced comprehensive equality should implement it by consulting Wisconsin’s example.</p>
