      "text": "This  essay  examines  the  structural  inequalities  in  academic  freedom protections between faculty and students at private universities, highlighted by  the  2023  Gaza-related  campus  protests.  While  faculty  members  enjoy multiple layers of protection through tenure, contracts, and legal precedents, students must rely solely on discretionary university policies interpreted by the  administrators  who  restrict  their  speech.  Through  analysis  of  recent campus conflicts, this essay argues that current frameworks for protecting student academic freedom in private universities are fundamentally inadequate and proposes establishing institutional oversight boards inspired by  social  media  governance  models.  Unlike  temporary  committees,  these boards  would  provide  consistent,  transparent  adjudication  processes  while building precedent for future cases. This essay demonstrates why university implementation of such oversight mechanisms offers distinct advantages over social  media  models,  including  manageable  case  volumes  and  clearer contextual  standards.  By  creating  institutional  separation  of  powers,  these reforms would help align administrative actions with stated commitments to academic freedom while maintaining necessary operational control.",

When facing disciplinary decisions, students must rely primarily on internal university procedures to  address  speech-related  grievances. 10 These  procedures  often  grant broad  discretion  to  the  same  administrators  who  initiated  the  original restrictions, creating an inherent conflict of interest. The consequences of speech-related sanctions also weigh more heavily on students. While the  contract  relationship  between  the  private  university  and  student permits legal action, 11 students rarely succeed because courts typically defer to institutional policy interpretations. Also, while faculty members dismissed from one institution can often secure positions elsewhere based on their established reputations and credentials, students face potentially career-ending consequences from expulsions or disciplinary actions that permanently mark their academic records.",

Student  speech  on  campus  faces  various  interferences,  from  prior restraints to ongoing shutdowns  and  post-event discipline.  While discipline  activates  remedy  procedures,  speech  shutdowns  and  prior restraints rarely trigger review processes. The recent Gaza protests at universities  demonstrate  this  gap  perfectly.  Without  formal  sanctions, administrators bypass reviewing their interventions. Furthermore, even when  sanctions follow 'disruptive' speech, no independent body evaluates whether these actions serve educational purposes or align with institutional principles. Reviews focus solely on disciplinary correctness, ignoring  speech  intervention  legitimacy.  Critical  questions  about  the necessity and proportionality of university responses remain unanswered, lost in a void of administrative discretion.",
