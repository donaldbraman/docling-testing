Christopher Walsh, Alabama Releases Annual List of Minor NCAA Infractions, Sports Illustrated (July 1, 2022), http://si.com/college/alabama/bamacentral/alabama-releases-annual-list-of-minor-ncaa-infractions. Among them was a coach sending a text message to a prospective student-athlete prior to the first permissible date to send recruiting materials to the prospect. Id. The university self-imposed penalties for the violation including prohibiting the women’s basketball staff from sending the prospect additional recruiting materials for the first 30 days when it becomes permissible to do so. Id. Because compliance administrators at times impose penalties on sport programs and coaches, both their colleagues in the athletics department and individuals outside of it may blame them for costly penalties or view the compliance staff as disloyal. Potuto, supra note 110, at 91. Compliance administrators’ work, therefore, can be both grudging and grudge-making.
