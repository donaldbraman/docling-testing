4,"It speaks to the persuasiveness with which Professor Hasbrouck prosecutes the case in the first half of his Article-that the Constitution has served as a tool of white supremacy-that I, for one, found myself resisting the defense he offers in the second half-that the Constitution can also be used as an instrument for 'an  abolitionist  constitutional  movement  sufficient  to  complete  the  work  of Reconstruction.' 40 And to be clear, my resistance to the claim of an antiracist Constitution is not because Professor Hasbrouck  is anything less than meticulous in advancing his vision. Indeed, to the extent that the heart of his argument is the recognition that from the moment our constitutional democracy proclaimed 'We the People' Black people always understood the Constitution as an instrument of their liberation, Professor Hasbrouck is undoubtedly correct. From Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, from the first corps of Black legislators  elected  to  Congress  after  the  War  to  members  of  the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, from Black soldiers who enlisted with the United States Colored Troops in the fight to save the Union to Black parents who sent their children in harm's way to integrate segregated schools, Black people always understood the Constitution as the key to freedom and equality in ways that the drafters themselves never fully appreciated. More to the point, Professor Hasbrouck demonstrates how this radical abolitionist view of both the 1789  and  Reconstruction  constitutions  was  not-is  not-a  mere  strategic rhetorical device, but rather can form the basis of what he calls a new antiracist Constitution.",text,body_text,I.,,100.0,matched

[7] In making his case for how we may hold in the mind these two seemingly contradictory ideas, Professor Hasbrouck manages to bring together two Black intellectual traditions that I had until now thought impossible to reconcile: the Black liberation jurisprudence of Justice Thurgood Marshall and the critical race theory scholarship of Professor Derrick Bell. I am not certain I am fully convinced that the work of the man who litigated Brown v. Board of Education [8] can in fact peacefully coexist with that of the man who insisted that Brown was made possible only because it did not threaten “the superior societal status of middle and upper class whites.” [9] But my skepticism in believing that it is within our reach to “enact a radical vision” [10] of the Constitution perhaps speaks more to the limits of my own moral imagination than it does to Professor Hasbrouck’s persuasiveness.

By itself, this statement is such commonplace that it hardly seems worth bothering to offer evidence to prove it. But it is still extraordinary to read collected in a single place—as Professor Hasbrouck does in his Article—the catalog of what he calls “a multidisc boxed set of racist decisions hits.” [11]",,0,html_body_unmatched

Davis [14] that the Equal Protection Clause does not prevent government from adopting policies that harm Black people so long as these policies are clothed in neutral garb; [15] here it is in 1876, holding in United States v. Cruikshank [16] that the federal government has no business prosecuting a white mob who set fire to a Louisiana Courthouse to prevent the Black freedmen gathered inside from exercising political power; [17] here it is in 1987, holding in McCleskey v. Kemp [18] that it is constitutional for a state to disproportionally impose the death penalty on Black people; [19] here it is in 1857, holding in Dred Scott v. Sandford [20] that Black people and their children, for all the generations to come, can never be people under the Constitution; [21] here it is in 2013, holding in Shelby County v. Holder [22] that the election of a lone Black President in more than two centuries means the end of racial discrimination in voting; [23] here it is in 1896, holding in Plessy v. Ferguson [24] that a Black man has no rights a white man is bound to respect; [25] here it is in 1974, holding in Milliken v. Bradley [26] that the random lines drawn on map to demarcate school districts are more important than providing a good education to Black children; [27] here it is in 1883, holding in the Civil Rights Cases [28] that Black people asking for a seat on a train or a table at a restaurant is akin to demanding special treatment; [29] here it is in 1906, holding in Hodges v. United States [30] that lynching black people is not a federal crime; [31] here it is in 2003, holding in Grutter v. Bollinger [32] that fifty years of half-hearted half measures are more than enough to remedy centuries of racial discrimination in higher education against Black people; [33] here it is in 1908, holding in Berea College v. Kentucky [34] that it is well within the power of a state to force a private university to stop educating Blacks and whites together; [35] here it is in 1981, holding in City of Memphis v. Greene [36] that white residents can wall off a Black neighborhood so long as they don’t explicitly say they are doing so in order to keep Black people out; [37] here it is in 1872, holding in Blyew v. United States [38] that the federal government has no power to prosecute two white supremacists for the ax murder of a Black family; [39] and on and on.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"It speaks to the persuasiveness with which Professor Hasbrouck prosecutes the case in the first half of his Article—that the Constitution has served as a tool of white supremacy—that I, for one, found myself resisting the defense he offers in the second half—that the Constitution can also be used as an instrument for “an abolitionist constitutional movement sufficient to complete the work of Reconstruction.” [40] And to be clear, my resistance to the claim of an antiracist Constitution is not because Professor Hasbrouck is anything less than meticulous in advancing his vision. Indeed, to the extent that the heart of his argument is the recognition that from the moment our constitutional democracy proclaimed “We the People” Black people always understood the Constitution as an instrument of their liberation, Professor Hasbrouck is undoubtedly correct. From Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, from the first corps of Black legislators elected to Congress after the War to members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, from Black soldiers who enlisted with the United States Colored Troops in the fight to save the Union to Black parents who sent their children in harm’s way to integrate segregated schools, Black people always understood the Constitution as the key to freedom and equality in ways that the drafters themselves never fully appreciated. More to the point, Professor Hasbrouck demonstrates how this radical abolitionist view of both the 1789 and Reconstruction constitutions was not—is not—a mere strategic rhetorical device, but rather can form the basis of what he calls a new antiracist Constitution.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Ironically, Professor Hasbrouck’s antiracist Constitution owes an intellectual debt to Justice John Harlan, whose dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson —proclaiming that court constitution is color blind—was in fact a thinly veiled endorsement of white supremacy. [41] For, while Justice Harlan’s dissent is often cited with great, if misguided, reverence, his earlier dissent in the Civil Rights Cases is the one deserving of respect because it articulated a vision of an antiracist Constitution. There, Justice Harlan explained that, if the 1787 Constitution, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, [42] the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, [43] and the Court’s own decisions in Prigg , Ableman v. Booth , [44] and Dred Scott , enlisted Federal government authority to enforce human subjugation, [45] the Reconstruction Amendments and accompanying Federal legislation were “adopted in the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, . . . rights inhering in the state of freedom, and belonging to American citizenship.” [46] According to Justice Harlan’s reading, the Reconstruction Amendments “did something more than to prohibit slavery as an institution . . . [they] established and decreed universal civil freedom throughout the United States.” [47] Justice Harlan’s interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments drew a crucial link between the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant, in Section 1, of birthright citizenship. According to Harlan, this interplay between the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments meant that Congress had full power to protect those rights “fundamental to citizenship in a free government.” [48] The Reconstruction Amendments and acts designed to enforce them were meant “to compel a recognition of the legal right of the black race to take that rank of citizens, and to secure the enjoyment of privileges belonging, under the law, to them as a component of the people for whose welfare and happiness government is ordained .” [49] What Professor Hasbrouck does is give substance to Justice Harlan’s theory of a new right to civil freedom, to show how, when read together and in the spirit in which they were drafted, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments may yet and finally remove the remaining badges of slavery and racial caste and return Congress to its rightful role of protecting freedom and equality for all.

,,,,"Bell had started his career as a civil rights litigator, first in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and then as counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (“LDF”). There, working with Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and Robert Carter, among others, Bell spent a decade trying to enforce Brown v. Board of Education while litigating hundreds of school desegregation cases in Mississippi. But, barely ten years after leaving the LDF, Bell would write that his own work on these cases had “helped to precipitate a rise in militant white opposition and . . . seriously eroded carefully cultivated judicial support,” [52] and that “the hoped-for improvement in schooling for black children that might have justified the sacrifice and risk . . . prove[d] minimal at best.” [53] Bell was clear-eyed in recognizing that political, economic, and social conditions contributed to the lack of meaningful progress for Black children. And yet, he also insisted, seemingly more in sadness than anger, that the generation of civil rights lawyers who won Brown had tried unsuccessfully to serve two masters: the need to obtain a good education for the children of Black parents who were their putative clients, and the desire to enforce Brown ’s equal protection principle of maximum desegregation of public schools. And, unable to serve these two masters, lawyers, such as Bell, had sacrificed the practical interests of Black parents to obtain a good education for their children in service of a “single-minded commitment to racial balance, a goal which, standing alone, is increasingly inaccessible and all too often educationally impotent.” [54]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But whatever disillusionment Bell may have experienced for the failure of civil rights lawyers to serve the needs of Black children paled in comparison to his acknowledgment a few years later that school desegregation in large part failed Black children because it was never in the interest of the white majority for it to succeed. Looking back over twenty-five years of litigation, Bell came to believe that Brown could not “be understood without some consideration of the decision’s value to whites, not simply those concerned about the immorality of racial inequality, but also those whites in policymaking positions able to see the economic and political advances at home and abroad that would follow abandonment of segregation.” [55] As Bell put it, “[t]he interest of blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of whites.” [56]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Bell’s interest-convergence theory represents an intellectual waystation in his career—between the starting line litigating school desegregation in Mississippi and the last stop arguing that “racism is permanent no matter what we do.” [57] For all of his critique of the decision, Bell admitted that few cases were as historically and constitutionally significant as Brown , and that, as numerous legal scholars and historians noted, the decision remained “perhaps the most important judgment ever handed down by an American Supreme Court,” [58] “the single most honored opinion in the Supreme Court’s corpus,” [59] and “nothing short of a reconsecration of American ideals.” [60] But, as seemingly sacrosanct as the decision had become, Bell and others have shown that as ultimately implemented, the decision failed in its stated purpose to achieve racial integration in public schools; [61] and second, that as originally conceived, the decision sacrificed the practical outcome of educational equality for the symbolic goal of racial integration with whites. [62] Or, as one scholar would later put it: “ Brown is of continuing significance mostly as a triumphal narrative that, ironically, serves as rhetorical support for the racial status quo and, only occasionally, as a dim reminder of a constitutional world that might have been.” [63]",,0,html_body_unmatched

All such hopes faded by the time he urged those in the fight for Black liberation to “recognize and acknowledge (at least to ourselves) that our actions are not likely to lead to transcendent change and may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help.” [64]",,0,html_body_unmatched

He may have insisted that “racism is permanent no matter what we do,” [77] but to the last he also believed that we had an obligation to fight against racism because, even when we fail, the fight itself brings meaning to our existence. [78] As for Justice Marshall, it is hard to imagine that in his own late years he remained convinced that we were capable of achieving true lasting miracles, particularly when he must have realized as he retired that much his work would very likely be undone by his successor.

,,,,"James Baldwin died in November 1987 at his home in Saint Paul de Vence, a small medieval walled hilltop village on the French Riviera, a world away from the ruined streets of Harlem, through which he drove to his father’s funeral forty-four years earlier. Like Justice Marshall’s jurisprudence and Professor Bell’s scholarship, Baldwin’s writing cataloged the historical record of what he called “the Negro’s past, of rope, fire, torture, castration, infanticide, rape; death and humiliation.” [80] But, while Baldwin would end up spending his dying days in a final exile away from the country of his birth, the place he called “the gaudiest, most valuable, and most improbable water wheel the world has ever seen,” [81] the sermon he spent a lifetime preaching came to this: “I do not for an instant doubt, and I will go to my grave believing that we can build Jerusalem, if we will.” [82]",,0,html_body_unmatched

In Booth , a number of Wisconsin state officials and private citizens openly defied federal authorities’ attempts to recapture a slave by the name of Joshua Glover. Abolitionists who assisted Glover to escape were prosecuted in the United States District Court for Wisconsin. See Robert J.
