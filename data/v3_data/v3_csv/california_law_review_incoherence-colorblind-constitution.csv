1,"The Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v.

Yet the  Court's  exception  for  race-based  essays  violates  each  of  these requirements. Rather than banish race from admissions decisions, the opinion merely channels race consciousness into the consideration of essays.

4,"This emphasis on colorblindness threatens to mislead readers, including lower  courts  and  students  applying  to  college.  The  colorblindness  debate obscures  a  gap  between  rhetoric  and  reality.  At  the  tail  end  of  the  majority opinion, the Court authorized race consciousness, even as it claimed to vindicate colorblindness.  The  Court  invalidated  the  race-conscious  admissions  policies before it, but it also ruled that equal protection does not prevent universities from admitting students based on essays that discuss their lived experiences with race. By juxtaposing the main rule 16 with  the  underexamined and undersung essay exception, 17 I reveal the majority opinion's fundamental incoherence. The Court asserted that equal protection requires that a student's race may never be used as a 'negative,' policies may not 'stereotype' students based on race, and policies must have a fixed endpoint.

A series of distortions facilitated his claim to be enforcingGrutter, rather than revising it. First, Roberts inverted one ofGrutter’s central holdings. Roberts stated that “[b]ecause “[r]acial discrimination [is] invidious in all contexts,”[60]any compelling interest in the context of affirmative action must be “sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review] under the rubric of strict scrutiny.”[61]Roberts built this measurability requirement on a snippet from theFishercase. After its remark about measurability,Fisherwent on to say that “the University articulated concrete and precise goals.”[62]The goals of the Harvard and UNC policies strongly resembled the goals of the University of Texas policy inFisher. Roberts’s citation is sleight of hand. It gives the impression that Roberts is enforcingFisherwhile he is actually reversing its finding that diversity is a compelling governmental interest. LikeFisher, theGruttermajority dismissed concerns about the vagueness of “critical mass,” deferred at least some extent to the university’s judgment, and found that diversity is a compelling governmental interest.[63]TheSFFACourt invented a new measurability test out of whole cloth. It effectively erasedGrutter’s finding of a compelling interest; required the universities to relitigate the question from scratch; and then imposed a new, heightened test. Yet the majority opinion never acknowledged this deviation fromGrutterandFisher. Nor did it engage the stare decisis analysis that should have guided its consideration of whether to overturn a (recently re-affirmed) precedent.",,84.21052631578947,matched

They filed amicus briefs and faced off against progressive Asian American groups, which filed briefs in support of race conscious admissions.[182]Professor Kim argued that the concepts of “White supremacy” and “people of color” obscure the reality of anti-Blackness; they wrongly imply that all non-White people are equivalent, as if Black people and Asian Americans are similarly situated.[183]Kim summed up the U.S. racial hierarchy as follows: “White is best but the most important thing is not-Blackness, and its corollary,Better Asians than Blacks.”[184]Asian Americans are “simultaneouslypushed down by white supremacy and lifted up by anti-Blackness. They are located, that is, at the turbulent juncture where the two forces meet.”[185]Scholars such as Professors Kim and Vinay Harpalani have argued that certain segments of the Asian American community are more susceptible than others to anti-affirmative action politics.[186]Given their liminal position between Whiteness and Blackness, Asian Americans and other non-Black people of color may be seduced into trying to align themselves with White people and thus partake in the many benefits of Whiteness.

It encourages students to write race-conscious essays and permits universities to admit students based on their lived experiences with race. This means thatGrutter’s authorization of race-conscious individualized consideration lives on in the context of essays.[208]As Jonathan Feingold has suggested, “colorblindness” should be understood as a heuristic that conceals multiple assumptions about whether race does and should matter in law and society.[209]Accordingly, I urge judges and scholars to unpack and deconstruct assertions of colorblindness. Close scrutiny reveals that claims about “colorblindness,” “preferences,” “race neutrality,” and “merit” often turn on a fictional baseline in which race does not matter.[210]Race has always mattered in America, and the 2024 election suggests that it will continue to do so at least for our lifetimes. When liberals acquiesce to colorblind discourses, they ignore racially-forged realities and cede the moral high ground.[211]",,95.97156398104265,matched
