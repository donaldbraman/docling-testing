1,Access Without the ADA: The Implications of the Federal Judiciary's Exemption from Following the Disability Rights Statute It Upholds,section_header,body_text,"Disability rights activist Judy Heumann, who played an instrumental role in passing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, once said: “Disability only becomes a tragedy when society fails to provide the things we need to lead our lives—job opportunities or barrier-free buildings, for example.”[199]The federal judiciary’s exemption from following the disability rights statutes it upholds is not only increasingly hypocritical, but also tragic. Disabled judicial employees should not have to subject themselves to unequal treatment, and disabled litigants, like George Lane, should not have to crawl up stairs to access the justice system.",,77.44360902255639,matched

1,"For over thirty years, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has  been  the  main  federal  protection  against  discrimination  for disabled people. Although ADA protections are ensured in the federal legislative  branch  and  in  state  courthouses,  this  pivotal  disability rights  statute  does  not  cover  the  federal  judiciary.

First, this Note describes the importance of the ADA and the current lack of disability protections in the federal judiciary. Second, it delves into the ramifications of the federal judiciary’s exemption from compliance with the ADA. Without ADA protections, disabled people do not have recourse when faced with discrimination and inaccessible spaces, threatening disabled people’s access to justice, access to the workplace, and representation on juries and within the federal judiciary itself. Finally, given these concerns, this Note argues that the federal judiciary should adopt ADA protections to align with its stated goal to provide “the strongest presumption of open access to all levels of the judicial system”[11]and to “reflect[] the diversity of the public it serves.”[12]More than thirty years after the passage of the ADA, it is past time to have an informed conversation with all relevant constituencies about applying ADA protections to the federal judiciary.",,91.78082191780823,matched
