3,"This Essay explores the implications of the Muñoz decision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The  Court  took  an  unnecessarily  maximalist  approach  in  Muñoz, undermining  the practical value of the right to marriage  for individuals married to noncitizens.

Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades  of  constitutional  case  law  by  denying  courts  a  role  in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches.

11,III.,section_header,body_text,"This Essay explores the implications of theMuñozdecision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The Court took an unnecessarily maximalist approach inMuñoz, undermining the practical value of the right to marriage for individuals married to noncitizens. Part II argues that the Court did so through one of its frequently used moves: namely, denying rights protections to a U.S. resident (here, a citizen by birth and resident of California) through a sleight of hand that reducedMuñoz’s constitutional rights and interests to those of a constitutional “outsider.”[9]This aspect of the case foreshadows the continued erosion of constitutional protections for the members of historically subordinated groups. Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades of constitutional case law by denying courts a role in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court’s substantive due process analysis in Muñoz.[10]Invidious discrimination drove, and was manifested in, the Court’s reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent. Part V critiques the historical errors of the Court’s purportedly originalist account and its selected level of generality. The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications ofMuñozfor the Constitution’s promise of equal protection.Muñoz’s limited reading of the “right to marriage” obviously shrinks the protective scope of the Constitution’s due process protections. But in so doing, it also legitimates familiar patterns of subordination along lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, and citizenship.",,100.0,matched
