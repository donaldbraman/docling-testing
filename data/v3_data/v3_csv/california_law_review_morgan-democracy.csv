1,Preemption Test,section_header,body_text,"Fortunately, such a change in the doctrine is possible. The current preemption test, which the California Supreme Court articulated inCity of Morgan Hill, allows the state to impliedly preempt local direct democracy if (1) the state statute deals with a statewide concern and (2) there is a “definite indication” or “clear showing” that the legislature intended to preempt the initiative or referendum power.[18]That “definite indication” exists when either (a) the legislature has created a system of regulation so pervasive that the local government’s action is considered administrative or (b) the state’s legislative authority is delegated “exclusively to the local legislative body,” as shown by the statutory text.[19]To resolve the issue of local governments stalling development, all the California Supreme Court would have to do is combine both parts of the “definite indication“ prong into one comprehensive test. In essence, this means that the court should (1) look for a statewide concern and (2) consider the size and scope of the state regulation. This is not a particularly novel approach: The late California Supreme Court Justice Armand Arabian contemplated a more expansive exclusive delegation test while dissenting inDeVita v. County of Napa.[20]Following Justice Arabian’s model, my proposed test eliminates the administrative-legislative inquiry and instead incorporates a new procedural component into the exclusive delegation test.",,100.0,matched

The statewide RHNA process is plainly incompatible with the exercise of local direct democracy powers. From the outset, the entire RHNA process takes two years to complete: HCD tells the COGs how much housing they need to plan for two years before the housing elements are due, and the COGs are required to tell local governments their respective allocations no later than a year before the housing elements are due.[139]This allows at most a year for an initiative to pass and even less for a referendum to reject a proposed housing element. The initiative process takes significant time: an unspecified amount of time to prepare the petition, 15 days after submission to receive a title and summary from the city attorney,[140]no more than 180 days to collect signatures,[141]and an additional 30 days (excluding weekends and holidays) for the local elections official to certify that the petition had sufficient signatures.[142]In sum, that is 225 days just to get a viable petition. From there, the city council has 10 days to adopt the petition, order a report (which could add 30 more days), or submit the petition to a vote.[143]That is a maximum of 265 days after the petition was submitted before voters even get a look at the initiative.[144]It is hard to reconcile the time required to submit a petition to vote with the year-long deadline the State has imposed upon local governments to adopt a housing element.[145]",,90.9090909090909,matched

Take, for instance,Yost v. Thomas, 685 P.2d 1152 (Cal. 1984), andDeVita v. County of Napa, 889 P.2d 1019 (Cal. 1995).Yostrelied upon the administrative-legislative test, whileDeVitarelied upon theCOSTexclusive delegation test. Changing theCOSTtest to incorporate the administrative-legislative test allows for both theYostandDeVitaholdings to stand, avoiding even more litigation about whether those two cases (and their progeny) are still good law.",96.47577092511013,matched

Charter cities may have more expansive initiative powers than general law cities, but because those vary city by city, this Note focuses on general law initiative powers for the sake of convenience.SeeHous. Auth. of Eureka v. Superior Ct., 219 P.2d 457, 461 (Cal. 1950) (overruled on other grounds). Despite this distinction, the initiative power of charter cities would still be preempted with regard to housing element laws under this Note’s proposed test.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
