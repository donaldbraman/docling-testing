1,"This  Note  explores  the  idea  of  paying  Americans  to  cast  their ballots  as  a  mechanism  to  increase  electoral  participation  among lower  income  voters  and  rebalance  the  influence that  wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal  literature  to  argue  that  subsidizing  the  franchise  could  help rebalance elected officials'  perception  of  the  'median  voter'  away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and  constitutionality  of  paying  the  voter.  When  President  Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United  States.  Nevertheless,  this  Note  argues  that,  based  on  the legislative  history  of  the  Act,  a  government  program  to  incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",text,body_text,"This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes.

2,I NTRODUCTION,section_header,body_text,"Level-up thinking is highly relevant to a voter incentive program. The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in cities and states that have significantly reduced barriers to voting. Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for small-dollar donors.[26]Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors.[27]Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result in greater progress towards achieving a representative electorate and ultimately addressing democratic imbalance. A great policy proposal that leverages this type of level-up thinking to address electoral imbalance is the Mobilization Matching Fund, proposed by Professor Bertrall Ross II.[28]This policy would use federal dollars to match campaign expenditures used to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent electoral participation, commonly referred to as “low-propensity voters.”[29]",,76.92307692307692,matched

Following that, the government must ensure each check makes it to the right household. In 2020 and 2021, the IRS and Treasury issued over $900 billion in direct payments to individuals as part of COVID-19 stimulus programs; in doing so the government ran into a lot of problems, including improper payments and getting funds to first-time tax filers and those experiencing homelessness.[243]Cities have developed tools to serve unhoused populations,[244]low-income tax filers,[245]and other hard-to-reach communities,[246]but if a highly resourced federal agency like the IRS faced challenges operationalizing a direct payment program, local governments might as well.

29,1. The Fourteenth Amendment,section_header,body_text,"This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials’ perception of the “median voter” away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",,92.5925925925926,matched

State of Maryland, the Fourth Circuit considered the constitutionality of a law requiring the state to purge those who had not voted in the prior five years from voter rolls.[146]The petitioners argued that the law compelled them to vote once every five years, thus burdening their right not to vote. The district court reasoned that “[t]he right not to vote—and to have one’s nonvote recorded—must be viewed in the same light. In that context, the right to vote includes the right not to vote.”[147]But the Fourth Circuit distanced itself from that rationale, stating that it “need not and do[es] not decide the correctness of the comparison because, even if there is a right not to vote of constitutional significance, it is not infringed upon by” the statute.[148]The district court’s analysis was paltry at best, and the Fourth Circuit never affirmatively held that the right to vote encompasses its opposite; rather, the panel assumed so for the purpose of holding that Maryland’s statute did not burden such a right.[149]",,100.0,matched

45,3. Allow Voters to Cast a Blank Ballot,section_header,body_text,"This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials’ perception of the “median voter” away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",,86.8421052631579,matched
