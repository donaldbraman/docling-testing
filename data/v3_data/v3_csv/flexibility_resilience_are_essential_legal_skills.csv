1,"The legal profession is facing an era of change driven by technological advancements, environmental crises, shifting client expectations, and evolving societal norms. This article argues that flexibility and resilience are not  just  positive  personality  traits  but  essential  legal  skills  that  should  be intentionally cultivated in law school curricula. By integrating adaptability into  legal  education-through  emphasizing  the  evolving  nature  of  law, incorporating interdisciplinary approaches, reshaping assessments, and fostering  collaborative  learning-law  schools  can  better  equip  students  to navigate  an  unpredictable  future.  Encouraging  law  students  to  embrace flexibility and resilience as a professional skill will not only enhance their long-term success but also strengthen the legal profession's ability to lead in times of transformation.",text,text,,,50.0,unmatched
