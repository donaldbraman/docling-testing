1,"The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, it must compensate  the  property  owner. 1     One  exception  to  this  rule,  the  'background principles' exception, establishes that 'the government does not take a property interest when it merely asserts a 'pre-existing limitation upon the land owner's title.'' 2   For instance, if a landowner is creating a nuisance on his property, the government owes him no compensation for forcing him to stop, 'because he never had the right to engage in the nuisance  in  the  first  place.' 3     The  concept  is  simple:  One  cannot  lose what was never his. 4",text,footnote,,^ Id.,100.0,matched

Roth , 75 “[p]roperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.” 76 Professor Stewart Sterk traces this reliance on state law (as opposed to general law) as far back as Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon 77 — the first case to recognize a regulatory taking. 78 Pennsylvania Coal , Sterk argues, emphasized state law’s importance for regulatory takings analysis by identifying specific property interests enshrined in state common law and legislation. 79 And by the late twentieth century, the Supreme Court routinely relied on state law to define property rights in cases challenging actions by state governments. 80 By “defer[ring] to state-specific property principles,” federal courts upheld property federalism and the accompanying “belief that property is an inherently local matter and that different states might opt to recognize and regulate property interests differently.” 81",,98.03149606299213,matched

14,III.  DANGERS OF GENERAL LAW BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES,section_header,body_text,"Because the Court’s jurisdictionless approach to background principles was not cemented until Cedar Point , and because the general law method itself did not gain a strong foothold until Tyler , jurisdictionless background principles remain nascent in both theory and practice. In this context, Baker and Slaybaugh serve as valuable early examples of how general law background principles function, foreshadowing how the general law method — which some have mistakenly understood to be limited to protecting property in gamesmanship cases 165 — can be used to deny takings claims. 166 They do so not only as mere data points, but also as illustrations of a few features of the general law approach to background principles that could systematically undercut property protections.",,82.0,matched
14,"In practice, however, the general law method seems unlikely to function as a one-way ratchet increasing property rights.  This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support  expansive  property  protections.    Specifically,  property  interests could be underprotected by general property law's interaction with the background principles exception.  To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims.  These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to  be over inclusive  of background principles,  as  it  necessitates  a  high level  of  generality.    Second,  placing  the  burden  on  plaintiffs  to  preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor. Third, general law approaches are incompatible with the requirement that background limitations inhere in a property owner's title itself.",text,footnote,,^ Id.,100.0,matched

The Supreme Court has yet to opine on this question, despite a growing circuit split. 123     The Fifth and Sixth Circuits recently weighed in, both denying the homeowners' claims for compensation. 124   In each case, the court  relied  on  the  general  law  approach  of Tyler and Cedar Point to identify background principles that absolved the government of liability.",text,footnote,,^ Id.,100.0,matched

Under the traditional state-law-only  approach, a  lack  of  controlling  law  would  theoretically always result  in  the  government  losing  its  background  principles defense - 'no-law' cannot operate in the background to limit a plaintiff's  property  right.

,,,,"The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, it must compensate the property owner. 1 One exception to this rule, the “background principles” exception, establishes that “the government does not take a property interest when it merely asserts a ‘pre-existing limitation upon the land owner’s title.’” 2 For instance, if a landowner is creating a nuisance on his property, the government owes him no compensation for forcing him to stop, “because he never had the right to engage in the nuisance in the first place.” 3 The concept is simple: One cannot lose what was never his. 4",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Background principles are a strong medicine. 5 When a court analyzes a takings claim, it must first identify the property interest at issue before deciding the more complex, discretionary question of whether that property was “taken.” 6 Background principles are “logically antecedent” to this analysis, 7 meaning that they can foreclose an aggrieved property owner’s claim before the first step. 8 If the court determines that, pursuant to a background principle, a plaintiff had no property interest to begin with, the government will completely evade takings liability for its interference with the plaintiff’s property. 9 Judges, too, can use background principles to avoid difficult legal and factual questions that may arise later in the takings analysis. 10",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But despite its potential, background principles jurisprudence has long remained underdetermined. 16 Scholars and courts have struggled with questions as basic as what counts as a background principle 17 and what rationale justifies the exception. 18 Notwithstanding these open questions, one deeply rooted feature of takings law has provided some degree of determinacy for the exception over the last several decades: the courts’ consistent use of state-specific law to define property interests. 19 But recently, even this fixture has come into flux.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This Part starts by providing a brief overview of the law of takings. After establishing that context, it discusses the development of the background principles exception.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Supreme Court has responded to these concerns with several efforts to guide judicial discretion in regulatory takings cases. 37 The first major effort arrived in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City , 38 which instructed courts to use a three-factor balancing test to analyze regulatory takings claims. 39 But even with Penn Central ’s added guidance, the law of regulatory takings continued to be criticized as being unduly vague. 40 Indeed, the Supreme Court has “generally eschewed any ‘set formula’ for determining how far is too far,” instead “preferring to ‘engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.’” 41 Still, continuing its effort to bring certainty to regulatory takings law, the Court has developed two types of categorical, or “per se,” takings — instances where a court could hold a regulation to be a taking without resorting to the unpredictable Penn Central analysis. 42",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Second, regulations resulting in “a physical ‘invasion’ of . . . property” are categorical takings. 47 This rule traces back to Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. , 48 which held that permanent physical invasions through regulations — for example, the required installation of cable equipment in an apartment building 49 — are categorical takings. 50 Recently, in Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid , 51 the Court broadened Loretto by establishing that “it is a per se taking whenever the government authorizes an involuntary entry to land,” regardless of whether that invasion is permanent or temporary. 52",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Cedar Point had the potential to provide greater clarity to the law of takings by expanding per se takings rules and therefore limiting the reach of Penn Central ’s ad hoc balancing test. To this end, the Cedar Point Court swept some regulations into the realm of physical takings, bringing a greater class of legislation into the ambit of categorical rules. 53 An access-permitting regulation can now be a per se taking regardless of whether it is partial or absolute, temporary or permanent, minute or substantial. 54",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A few years later, Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Cedar Point majority, applied a general law approach. 95 To justify Cedar Point ’s expansive rule that any physical invasion effectuated through a regulation constitutes a taking, Chief Justice Roberts first concluded that “property” entails the absolute “right to exclude,” 96 which “cannot be balanced away.” 97 Because “the right to exclude is ‘universally held to be a fundamental element of the property right,’” 98 a regulation burdening this right categorically creates a Fifth Amendment taking. 99 The Court’s exaltation of the right to exclude, and its subsequent holding that the California access regulation was a taking, rested on Blackstone’s Commentaries , a law review article, and Supreme Court precedents. 100 In fact, the Court effectively prioritized general law over state law. As Professor Maureen Brady observes, “the Court used a selective general-law approach to elide the question whether the longstanding California access regulation should constitute a background principle limiting agricultural owners’ title.” 101",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Cedar Point ’s general law approach is particularly striking because the majority itself acknowledged that “property rights . . . are creatures of state law.” 102 Yet the Court nonetheless declined to apply the traditional state-law approach to defining the property interest by reiterating its fears of gamesmanship: The state, it said, “cannot absolve itself of takings liability” by manipulating property rights. 103",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Addressing the question of whether Tyler had a property interest in the surplus, the Court’s historical analysis spanned from the Magna Carta to the present. 110 The Court held that the 1935 statute was invalid in part because Minnesota’s rule allowing state retention of surplus equity “remains the minority rule today: Thirty-six states and the Federal Government” maintain the opposite rule. 111 This holding reversed the Eighth Circuit, which had considered a wider breadth of Minnesota law to conclude that the foreclosure statute had not impermissibly abrogated a constitutional right to the surplus. 112",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Along these lines, Professor Eric Claeys argues that Murr , Tyler , Cedar Point , and other cases show that the Court primarily departs from state-law definitions of property when “claimants are . . . gaming state law” or when “state legislators and regulators are . . . trying to convert state rights into dead letters.” 115 Tyler ’s general law approach “makes a considerable amount of sense normatively and practically,” 116 argues Claeys, in part because it allows federal courts to step in “when state law does not seem to specify the relevant [property] rights reliably.” 117",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Given the suggestion that the general law method functions to protect property rights, those who favor increased property protections might celebrate Cedar Point and Tyler for their pro-property outcomes. 118 This fact should come as no surprise. For those who fear that modern regulatory-takings jurisprudence protects too little property, 119 Cedar Point was a victory over earlier cases like PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins , 120 which held, under the ad hoc Penn Central test, that the government did not owe private property owners compensation when it created an access right similar to the one in Cedar Point . 121 Similarly, some viewed Minnesota’s practice in Tyler as “home equity theft,” such that deciding for the State would have “set a dangerous precedent.” 122 Given the Court’s general law interventions against anti-property government actions in Cedar Point and Tyler , some observers might develop the impression that federal courts use general property law only to protect, rather than undermine, property rights.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In practice, however, the general law method seems unlikely to function as a one-way ratchet increasing property rights. This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support expansive property protections. Specifically, property interests could be underprotected by general property law’s interaction with the background principles exception. To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler ’s general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners’ takings claims. These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to be over inclusive of background principles, as it necessitates a high level of generality. Second, placing the burden on plaintiffs to preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government’s favor. Third, general law approaches are incompatible with the requirement that background limitations inhere in a property owner’s title itself.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Both cases that this Part analyzes follow a pattern: In order to stop an emergency or make an arrest, the police destroy private property. In these scenarios, when (if ever) is the government liable for a taking? The Supreme Court has yet to opine on this question, despite a growing circuit split. 123 The Fifth and Sixth Circuits recently weighed in, both denying the homeowners’ claims for compensation. 124 In each case, the court relied on the general law approach of Tyler and Cedar Point to identify background principles that absolved the government of liability.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Baker cited only one Texas case, Steele v. City of Houston , 132 for the proposition that, in Texas, “[u]ncompensated destruction of property has been occasionally justified by reason of war, riot, pestilence or other great public calamity.” 133 But Steele on its face does not justify the expansive necessity principle that Baker established. Among other things, the Steele court explained that, according to a ninetheenth-century remedial statute, Texas municipalities could “destr[oy] a dwelling to prevent a public calamity,” 134 such as a rapidly spreading fire, 135 subject to several procedural requirements pertinent to “[t]he decision to destroy” the home. 136 The statute gave the property owner the right to seek compensation after the fact before an administrative body. 137",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Baker court made no effort to test its rule’s compatibility with Steele or Texas state law generally. Instead, it plucked a quotation from Steele and refrained from any nuanced discussion of state-specific law. 146 If the court had engaged with Texas law, however, it may have found that, at the very least, Baker’s case deserved a remand to the trial court for further proceedings on the necessity issue. 147 It also could have certified the question to Texas courts for more guidance.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Baker thus wielded a background principle found in general law to limit property rights, potentially overriding a tradition in Texas limiting necessity to certain extreme circumstances. Considering that the necessity exception is not recognized by every state, 148 though it is deeply rooted in the general common law, 149 champions of property protections should be concerned that a general law approach could similarly abrogate other states’ attempts to protect private property. For example, in Pennsylvania Coal , “[Justice] Holmes’s determination that constitutionally protected property existed” relied upon Pennsylvania’s unique recognition of an innovative property interest called a “support estate.” 150 Had the Pennsylvania Coal Court applied a general law conception of property — or had it found an applicable jurisdictionless background principle to undercut the support estate property right — it could have effectively overridden Pennsylvania’s choice to protect a new form of property.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Sixth Circuit, once again guided by Tyler , held that the Slaybaughs could not recover under the Takings Clause because the police action was covered by the “search-and-arrest privilege,” which exempts the state from liability for “police use of force when carrying out a lawful arrest.” 154 Because of this privilege — one of the “background limitations” alluded to in Cedar Point 155 — “the Slaybaughs had no right to exclude law enforcement’s privileged actions in the first place, [so] police . . . [could not] be said to have ‘taken’ any of their . . . property interests.” 156",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Slaybaugh court, understanding background principles through the general law approach, reasoned that “[t]he Supreme Court instructs us to look to common law privileges on property rights” in adjudicating a takings claim. 157 Acting on this guidance, the court based its holding on: (1) the search-and-arrest exception’s recognition in the Second Restatement of Torts; 158 (2) early English common law precedents showing that “English courts repeatedly recognized that officers were not liable for certain property damage resulting from their lawful entries”; 159 (3) “early state and federal court decisions . . . [that] held that a police officer who used force to carry out a search or arrest was not liable for any damage resulting from his lawful actions”; 160 and (4) recent decisions of courts in Washington, New York, and Louisiana recognizing the search-and-arrest exception. 161 But what happened to Tennessee state law?",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Perhaps the Sixth Circuit did not address Tennessee law because Tennessee courts have taken no position on the search-and-arrest privilege. That Tennessee has not taken a position on the availability of the privilege, however, does not absolve the Sixth Circuit of its responsibility under Lucas to consult “State[] law.” 162 Moreover, allowing federal courts to fill in state law’s silence with general law background principles could systematically underprotect property. Under the traditional state-law-only approach, a lack of controlling law would theoretically always result in the government losing its background principles defense — “no-law” cannot operate in the background to limit a plaintiff’s property right. But where courts can reach out to general law, they can find background limitations absolving the government of Takings Clause liability, even where state law would have required compensation.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In Baker and Slaybaugh , the courts denied innocent homeowners’ claims when the government destroyed their homes. In doing so, the Baker court recognized this outcome’s manifest injustice, disserving ‘‘[t]he Fifth Amendment’s guarantee . . . [that prevents the] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” 185 It only increases the sense of injustice in Baker and Slaybaugh that the homeowners were denied compensation based on sources of law that they could not have known about, like customs recognized in feudal England and New York. And because the general law is not bound to any jurisdiction, these cases will set a nationwide precedent for uncompensated property destruction, leaving the foundational requirement that a background principle “inhere in the title itself” uninterrogated. 186",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Background principles, like constitutional property itself, have long been rooted in state-specific law. Recently, however, the Supreme Court’s turn to jurisdictionless property law has collided with its background principles jurisprudence. The result is a model of background principles based on an unbounded source of general property law that spans centuries and continents. These ascendant general law background principles threaten to systematically undermine property rights while disserving the fundamental premise that those rights derive from social expectations. As the constitutional definition of property continues to evolve, courts and scholars should recognize the potential for general law background principles to dilute property protections.",,0,html_body_unmatched
