,,,,"How should the law respond to intentionally useless objects that are constructed from scarce materials and thrust into an overcrowded world?Approximately sixty million tons of electronic waste, or “e-waste” — for example, discarded iPhones, refrigerators, desktop computers — is produced each year. This annual pile of electronic rubbish represents sixty-two billion dollars’ worth of tangible raw materials (such as gold and other scarce metals) that has been rendered useless. In addition to wasting raw materials, e-waste clogs our landfills, poisons the groundwater, and taxes our capacity to store it. Worst of all, much of this waste is intentionally created by electronics manufacturers through the profit-maximizing strategy of planned obsolescence.Planned obsolescence is a strategy by which manufacturers intentionally limit the utility of their products so that consumers are forced to discard them and buy new products. Planned obsolescence creates intentionally useless objects and imposes significant social costs. While some of the costs of planned obsolescence are felt within the manufacturer-purchaser transaction (a purchaser must consider whether a product will last long enough to justify its price), the most significant social costs of the strategy remain external to that transaction.This Article offers three principal contributions. First, a normative thesis: More of the social costs of intentionally useless objects should be borne by the manufacturers that profit from the strategy. Second, a theoretical insight: Avoiding waste is a central commitment of property law. In fact, many of the rules of property law are rendered more coherent when they are understood as a series of instantiations of an antiwaste imperative. Often confused with an efficiency principle, property law’s antiwaste commitment best explains doctrinal choices that otherwise would seem inconsistent. Finally, a doctrinal analysis: The antiwaste imperative (when applied to the existing rules of property) disallows the conveyance of a fee simple in an intentionally useless object. Recognizing an antiwaste imperative in this context would mean that manufacturers can only convey a defeasible interest in the object, retaining a reversionary interest that serves to correct some of the negative externalities associated with the strategy of planned obsolescence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In 2020, Apple “agreed to pay up to $500 million” in a consumer-fraud lawsuit that alleged that it had issued a software update to intentionally slow down older phones. 1 The suit alleged that the slowdown was intended to frustrate consumers into discarding their existing phones and purchasing new phones rather than simply replacing the phone battery. 2",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"If the allegations in the suit were accurate, then Apple was engaged in a strategy of planned obsolescence. 3 Planned obsolescence is a business strategy where a product is intentionally designed to have a limited lifespan and to become obsolete within a designated time frame. 4 This strategy encourages (or in some cases, forces) consumers to replace their existing products with newer models, leading to repeat purchases and increased income for the manufacturer. 5 In designing products to fail within a designated time frame, manufacturers are engaged in the mass production of intentionally useless objects.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Unsurprisingly, planned obsolescence strategies also generate enormous amounts of physical waste in the form of discarded objects. 6 Electronic waste is one of the most harmful forms of this waste. 7 Electronic waste is generated when consumers discard obsolete refrigerators, laptops, smartphones, gaming consoles, microwaves, cameras, printers, and so forth. 8 These electronic objects contain toxic materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that leach into the surrounding environment, poisoning water supplies and wildlife and posing grave risks to human health. 9",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Nearly sixty million tons of electronic waste is discarded annually, much of it produced by planned obsolescence, representing a substantial form of resource depletion. 10 Intentionally useless objects require enormous amounts of energy and raw material, including rare and precious metals. 11 As of 2019, electronic waste represented approximately sixty-two billion dollars’ worth of tangible raw materials (such as gold and other scarce metals) that have been intentionally rendered useless. 12",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Electronic waste also accounts for seventy percent of our toxic waste production. 13 Only about twenty percent of electronic waste is recycled. 14 The remaining eighty percent ends up in landfills and other waste repositories. 15 Not only does this impose land use and other environmental costs, but it also imposes significant costs on human health, environmental justice, and community wellbeing. 16",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A great challenge posed by planned obsolescence is that most of the costs imposed by the practice are not borne by the manufacturers who profit from it. 17 From the perspective of manufacturers, planned obsolescence is an extremely profitable strategy. 18 In other words, planned obsolescence produces excessive negative externalities in the form of resource depletion and the proliferation of useless, toxic objects. 19",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"To some degree, consumer protection law has attempted to address the issue (as evidenced by the Apple case), but consumer protection law has not succeeded in causing manufacturers to bear enough of the costs associated with planned obsolescence to disincentivize the practice. 20 Legislation that specifically addresses planned obsolescence could potentially force manufacturers to internalize more of the social costs associated with the strategy. 21 Indeed, the European Union has adopted a legislative model known as “extended producer responsibility” that requires manufacturers to take economic (and in some cases, physical) responsibility for the electronic waste generated by planned obsolescence. 22 However, a successful legislative response to planned obsolescence has not been forthcoming in the United States. 23 Fortunately, a legislative response is not the only means of correcting the negative externalities associated with planned obsolescence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This Article demonstrates that common law property rules — as currently constituted and consistently applied — are capable of correcting some of the negative externalities of planned obsolescence. Property rules — when viewed through the lens of an antiwaste principle — limit manufacturers’ capacity to convey title to an object that has been intentionally rendered useless. When a manufacturer creates an object with an intentionally limited lifespan, the object has a defeasible condition 24 built into the thing itself. Because the manufacturer has intentionally equipped the object with a utility time bomb, the manufacturer cannot convey title beyond the point in time of the planned obsolescence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For example, if the object is a phone, it will only be a phone until the point of intentional obsolescence at which point it no longer functions as a phone and will transition into an intentionally useless object. In that scenario, the manufacturer cannot convey title to the phone in fee simple. 25 Fee simple title means ownership of the object could potentially extend into infinity. 26 It is impossible to own a phone indefinitely if it will — by design — cease existing as a functional phone within a predetermined period of time. 27 Consequently, the manufacturer can only convey a defeasible title 28 : title until the intended obsolescence. 29 Because the manufacturer can only convey a defeasible title, the manufacturer necessarily retains a reversionary interest 30 in the object. 31 The reversionary interest requires the manufacturer to assume responsibility for disposing of the intentionally useless object when it becomes obsolete. 32",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The idea that a fee simple cannot be conveyed in an object of planned obsolescence is consistent with property law’s broader commitment to an antiwaste principle. 33 Antiwaste is a fundamental commitment of property law, although the relationship between common law property rules and antiwaste principles has been both misunderstood and undertheorized. 34 In fact, many of the rules of property are rendered more coherent when we understand them as a series of instantiations of the Lockean imperative against waste. 35 Often confused with a consequentialist efficiency imperative, the Lockean imperative against waste is a deontological proposition that it is wrong to intentionally (or negligently) destroy objects of property. 36",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Regardless of whether Locke gets this right (that is, whether the content of the proposition is true), this imperative against waste forms a central commitment of property doctrine as it is currently constituted. 37 Central to the Lockean imperative against waste is the understanding that the right of ownership simply does not extend to the power to destroy. 38 Insofar as we intentionally destroy an object, we lose the right to own it — and thereby the power to convey it. 39",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A consistent application of property law’s existing commitment to an antiwaste principle reveals that property law is already positioned to prompt manufacturers to bear more of the social costs of planned obsolescence. The existing rules of property, when consistently applied, prohibit the conveyance of a fee simple in an intentionally useless object. 40 Applying the Lockean antiwaste imperative in this context would mean that manufacturers can only convey a defeasible interest in the object, retaining a reversionary interest that serves to correct some of the negative externalities associated with the strategy of planned obsolescence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,These arguments are presented in the following format. Part I of this piece offers an overview of the problem of intentionally useless objects. Part II describes the relationship between property law and the imperative against waste.

,,,,,"^ A defeasible title, or a “defeasible estate,” is a more limited form of ownership than a fee simple in that a defeasible estate will end if a particular condition comes to pass. See 1 Restatement (First) of Prop. § 16 cmt. b, at 43 ( Am. L. Inst. 1936). An example of a defeasible estate might be: “Blackacre to A , until A goes to prison.” This conveyance would create a type of defeasible estate known as a “fee simple determinable,” and “going to prison” is a defeasible condition that could trigger the end of A ’s estate. See id. § 44, at 121. In this example, O (the original owner and grantor of this estate) has a “reversionary interest” in the estate. If A goes to prison, Blackacre will automatically return to O , and O will be the owner in fee simple again. “Reversionary interest” is a broad term that roughly describes an interest retained by O in a conveyance. 1 Restatement (Second) of Prop.: Donative Transfers § 1.4 cmt. c, at 49 ( Am. L. Inst. 1983) (“A reversionary interest is what remains in a transferor who owns a vested interest and has made a transfer that does not exhaust the transferor’s interest in the property transferred, so that an interest in the transferred property may return to the transferor at some future date.”). Here, O ’s “reversionary interest” is technically a “possibility of reverter.” See Dukeminier et al., supra note 25, at 296. Other reversionary interests that can be retained by O include a “reversion” and a “right of entry.” Id. For a discussion of defeasible estates and their corresponding future interests, see 1 Restatement (First) of Prop. § 16, at 43 ( Am. L. Inst. 1936): “An estate in fee simple defeasible is an estate in fee simple which is subject to a special limitation (defined in § 23), a condition subsequent (defined in § 24), an executory limitation (defined in § 25) or a combination of such restrictions.”",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,"^ This is both a descriptive point and a normative point. It describes an understanding of property law’s existing commitment to an antiwaste principle that disallows the destruction of property in the absence of use and enjoyment. See John Locke, Two Treatises of Government 249 (London, Awnsham Churchill 1690). Applying this preexisting commitment in the context of planned obsolescence compels this result. However, it is reasonable to also characterize this as a normative point: that the antiwaste principle should be recognized to extend to this context. Some scholars might question whether a defeasible interest can be created in personal property, given the restriction of numerus clausus . See, e.g. , Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, Optimal Standardization in the Law of Property: The Numerus Clausus Principle , 110 Yale L.J. 1, 17–18 (2000) (“A number of standard reference works state that personal property is subject to the same elaborate structure of forms that applies to estates in land (including future interests). Yet the case law does not fully support this broad proposition. It is reasonably well established that one can create a life estate in personal property. But there are few if any cases that address the question of whether more exotic interests, such as defeasible fees and executory interests, can be created in personal property.” (footnotes omitted)). However, in terms of the values that are supported by the rule of numerus clausus (for example, controlling complexity, lowering information costs, increasing certainty, and so forth, see id. at 8), there is little (if any) difference between the creation of a life estate in personal property (which is well established by case law) and a defeasible estate in personal property given that the defining characteristic in each estate is a future interest created in someone other than the present interest holder. In fact, a defeasible interest may serve to better control complexity, lower information costs, and increase certainty as compared to a life estate given that the termination date of a life estate is inherently unknowable, while a defeasible condition could potentially arise at a predictable point in time. Without a contrary directive from the courts, it is reasonable to assume that estates that exist in real property likewise exist in personal property. See Meredith M. Render, The Law of the Body , 62 Emory L.J. 549, 563 (2013) (“[I]n real and personal property the principal forms of ownership interest are the fee simple, fee simple defeasible, life estate, and leasehold.”); 96 C.J.S.
