I am immensely grateful to my Symposium Committee—Chris Aranda, Susie Emerson, Abigail George, Aimee Grainer, Alexa Iraheta Sousa, Nikhil Mahadeva, Nicole Morote, Alice Park, Juan Ramon Riojas, and Charles Simonds. Without their tireless effort and dedication, hosting this conference and publishing this Issue would not have been possible.

Christensen’s Symposium piece, The Right to Protest in Indian Country , asserts that between the three potential sovereigns impli­cated by protests on indigenous lands—the tribe, the state govern­ment, and the federal government—tribal governments should be the sole regu­lator of these protests. 41 41 See Grant Christensen, The Right to Protest in Indian Country, 125 Colum.

Columbia still utilized internal disciplinary processes against student activ­ists between 1968 and 2024. See id. (“Some of these [post-1968] protests led to disciplinary code charges. None elicited a criminal law enforcement response.”); see also Sarah Huddleston & Maya Stahl, Inside Columbia’s Surveillance and Disciplinary Operation for Student Protesters, Colum.
