2,TABLE OF CONTENTS,section_header,body_text,"Given these inhospitable conditions for developing economies, IIAs have the potential to create regulatory chill where states may otherwise act in protection of their populations’ human rights. 56 See sources cited supra note 22. For the purposes of this Note, human rights are not amorphous, vaguely defined principles. Instead, when referring to “human rights,” the author means those rights enshrined in widely ratified treaties and conventions and often also adopted into corresponding domestic law. For some examples of widely recognized human rights obligations please see those contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, opened for signature Dec. 19, 1966, 993 U.N.T.S. 3 (entered into force Jan. 3, 1976); International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, opened for signature Mar. 7, 1966, 660 U.N.T.S. 195 (entered into force Jan. 4, 1969); International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, opened for signature Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 (entered into force Mar. 23, 1976); and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, opened for signature Mar. 30, 2007, 2515 U.N.T.S. 3 (entered into force May 3, 2008). For example, many countries have increased environmental regulations in the face of a dire climate crisis. These regulations will have a particular financial impact on the extractive and energy sectors, which accounted for 47% of all new ICSID cases in 2021. 57 ICSID Releases 2021 Caseload Statistics , ICSID (Feb. 7, 2022), https://icsid.worldbank.org/news-and-events/comunicados/icsid-releases-2021-caseload-statistics [ perma.cc/H2RL-YE6A ]. Indeed, some experts estimate that state action across the globe in response to climate change could generate $340 billion in state liability. 58 Kyla Tienhaara, Rachel Thrasher, B.

3,"International investment law provides stability for investors, helps capital flow across the globe, and can be a critical tool for sustainable development. This regime, however, has become increasingly controversial, in part due to its inability to reconcile investor obligations with competing human rights obligations. International investment treaties provide substantive guarantees to investors, including submission to binding arbitration in the event of breach. When found in breach of one of these guarantees, international investment arbitral tribunal awards are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially creating 'regulatory chill' for states that may otherwise take affirmative action to protect human rights out of concern that regulation may run afoul of their treaties' international investment provisions.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
3,"Some legal scholars have posited a fiduciary theory of statehood, whereby a state owes a fiduciary duty to its people, much like that in domestic corporate law. This Note proposes looking to the fiduciary theory of statehood for a path forward. It then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders). The fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime. This framework offers a timely, pragmatic solution as the international community actively reconsiders the balance between investor protection and state sovereignty.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

As mentioned earlier in the context of the contractual approach, a state may consider adding reciprocal obligations on investors to better dispatch its duty as a fiduciary. 153 See supra Section III.A. A fiduciary duty is affirmative, requiring the state to act as a protector of its beneficiaries.

Parents 'cannot destroy their child . . . since they have brought . . . a citizen of the world into a condition which cannot now be indifferent to them even just according to concepts of Right.' 79 Children have an innate right to their parents' care stemming from their intrinsic dignity as people. 80",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

This Note proposes looking to the fiduciary theory of statehood for a path forward. It then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders). The fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime. This framework offers a timely, pragmatic solution as the international community actively reconsiders the balance between investor protection and state sovereignty.",,75.67567567567568,matched
15,"In addition to its philosophical underpinning, the fiduciary theory of sovereignty can be understood by analogy to fiduciary duties in domestic corporate law. A corporation is defined by its separation of ownership and management. 84 The paradigmatic publicly held corporate entity has two key governing actors: directors and shareholders. 85 Shareholders are the owners of the company, while the board of directors oversees the corporation's overall operations and exercises management power. A typical public company has millions of outstanding shares, if not billions. 86 Thus, like a population, shareholders' ownership power is often diffuse and difficult to exercise in coordinated and collective ways. 87 Thus, left unchecked, directors' management power can present an agency problem where the agent (directors) engages in opportunistic behavior at the expense of its principals (shareholders). 88 Corporate law remedies this by placing fiduciary duties on directors. This safeguard includes a duty of good faith, whereby directors must act in the best interests of the corporation's shareholders. 89",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

A court in the United States would consider this behavior a breach of the executive's fiduciary duty and could invalidate the agreement altogether. 92 The fiduciary theory thus clarifies the nature of the state's authority and serves as a theoretical framework to understand the affirmative role that a state must play in protecting its population's human rights.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace.

Arbitrators not beholden to certain types of parties will be more free to consider the public policy implications of their decisions. The adoption of the atmospheric approach by these arbitrators during this lead-up period will be transformative.

Thus, concepts such as proxy advisory firms and controlling stakes will not be discussed here. Thus, left unchecked, directors’ management power can present an agency problem where the agent (directors) engages in opportunistic behavior at the expense of its principals (shareholders). 88 Michael C. Jensen, Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow, Corporate Finance, and Takeovers , 76 Am. Econ. Rev. 323 (1986). As an example of a paradigmatic agency problem, imagine a director at Company A who, on the side, owns his own consulting firm. When Company A needs consulting services, this director may use his management power to ensure that his firm wins the consulting contract, perhaps even charging Company A above-market consulting fees. To do so would be in the director’s best interest but not that of the shareholders. While shareholders bear the consequences of such decisions, they themselves cannot exercise managerial control to vindicate their own interests. Corporate law remedies this by placing fiduciary duties on directors. This safeguard includes a duty of good faith, whereby directors must act in the best interests of the corporation’s shareholders. 89 See, e.g. , In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litig., 907 A.2d 693, 753–56 (Del. Ch. 2005), aff’d , 906 A.2d 27 (Del. 2006).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Such is the case for the state. Sovereign power derives from a diffuse population but must be exercised and operationalized by a governmental entity. A government may, in theory, run the same risks of an agency problem as a corporate board. Government officials can have interests that differ from the citizenry that they represent—they could be courted by lobbyists, have financial stakes in certain industries, or have political aspirations such that they use their governing power to act in ways that are not to their constituency’s direct benefit. The constraint of fiduciary duties is thus as applicable to the state as it is to the corporation. Fiduciary duties are one way to solve the agency problem in a corporate context; constraining state sovereignty with fiduciary duties can solve the problem in a government context as well.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The fiduciary theory provides a clarifying alternative to the status quo for understanding the state’s obligations in the international investment context. The state can be understood as an agent, empowered on behalf of its principal—the population subject to its jurisdiction. When states enter IIAs, they act as agents on behalf of their citizenry. Just as a company’s board of directors may enter a contract on behalf of the company to benefit shareholders, states enter into IIAs with each other for the economic benefit of their respective populations. 90 For a discussion of the idea that an investment can fall under an IIA only if it is for the explicit development of the host state, see generally Dai Tamada, Must Investments Contribute to the Development of the Host State? The Salini Test Scrutinised , in Law and Development: Balancing Principles and Values 95 (Piotr Szwedo, Richard Peltz-Steele & Dai Tamada eds ., 2019).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In negotiating IIAs, the state is contracting for the benefit of its people. Entering into IIAs can invite foreign investment to stimulate the local economy, create jobs, and set clear expectations on both sides of the transaction. 91 See supra Section I.A. Thus, states enter into these agreements to further the best interests of their beneficiary population. But difficulties arise when human rights obligations come into conflict with investors’ rights. This issue can be remedied by using the fiduciary theory of sovereignty as a guiding framework both in interpreting the IIA in question and in understanding a state’s authority to negotiate the agreement in the first place.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"When a state enters into an IIA, it negotiates in its capacity as a fiduciary. A tribunal cannot understand the state to have negotiated purely for the government’s own benefit or with any intention to undermine its population’s human rights. To contract away the ability to protect its population’s human rights would require an authority or power that does not belong to the state. To draw another parallel to the private domestic law context, when a director signs documents for their company, they are not authorized to negotiate to the company’s detriment or for their own interest. A court in the United States would consider this behavior a breach of the executive’s fiduciary duty and could invalidate the agreement altogether. 92 See, e.g. , Tornetta v. Musk, 250 A.3d 793 (Del. Ch. 2019); Coggins v. New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., 492 N.E.2d 1112 (Mass. 1986). The fiduciary theory thus clarifies the nature of the state’s authority and serves as a theoretical framework to understand the affirmative role that a state must play in protecting its population’s human rights.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The fiduciary theory has numerous potential means of adoption. It can be implemented through the contractual approach, which informs how specific treaty provisions in next-generation IIAs are drafted. This approach suggests that states should explicitly incorporate the fiduciary theory into new IIAs going forward. The fiduciary theory can also be incorporated into the judicial approach, which focuses on the interpretation of existing treaties. The judicial approach advocates for arbitrators to consider the fiduciary theory when interpreting IIAs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues—from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace. As already discussed, this regime is adrift when it comes to reconciling this fundamental tension. The fiduciary theory provides not only a theoretical framework, but also an actionable path forward to lend legitimacy to an increasingly controversial legal regime.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,The contractual approach is the most concrete and direct way for states to implement the fiduciary theory of sovereignty in constructing IIAs. The premise is simple: Insert specific provisions into new IIAs that better enables a state to regulate in protection of its population’s human rights.,,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Specific treaty provisions could incorporate the fiduciary theory into IIAs. This approach fits well within current trends in international investment law, with some reformers pinning their hopes on new IIAs entering into force. 96 UNCTAD, Trends in the Investment Treaty Regime and a Reform Toolbox for the Energy Transition , supra note 65, at 4. The fiduciary theory could serve as a guiding framework for treaty drafting, even if the treaty does not explicitly incorporate the theory. Exceptions clauses in new-generation IIAs specify situations where the IIA could apply but does not. By contrast, treaty provisions enacting the fiduciary theory of sovereignty would specify situations where a state’s obligations to its people prevent it from contracting at all.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"These provisions would be a redundancy measure, or a “belt and suspenders” approach, given that an explicit provision would merely affirm rather than create the state’s fiduciary duty to its people. Redundancy measures, however, are used in both international and domestic law. 97 For an example in the domestic administrative law context, see Ethan J. Leib & James J. Brudney, The Belt-and-Suspenders Canon , 105 Iowa L. Rev. 735 (2020). Often, treaties merely codify existing international law and obligations that previously existed only through customary international law. 98 Greenwood , supra note 36, at 3–4. To include such a provision in IIAs, which reflect an existing notion of sovereignty, would be in line with the logic of treaties in general—memorializing obligations, preexisting or otherwise, to ensure that states receive the benefits of their bargains.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The contractual approach is helpful because it can constrain arbitrators and give clearer effect to a state’s intention in negotiating IIAs. If states are better able to give effect to their rights and intentions at the treaty-drafting phase, there is lower risk of those intentions being distorted through the obtuse process of judicial interpretation. Furthermore, when negotiating new-generation IIAs, states may consider imposing reciprocal obligations on investors, especially as they concern the protection of human and environmental rights. 102 Indeed, in recent years some states have already incorporated investor obligations in their IIAs. See Increasing Dichotomy , supra note 94, at 5. For an example of these obligations in current agreements, see Supplementary Act A/SA.3/12/08 Adopting Community Rules on Investment and the Modalities for their Implementation with ECOWAS, Dec. 18, 2008, https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/international-investment-agreements/treaty-files/3266/download [ perma.cc/3KC9-ABYZ ].

,,,,"While the contractual approach can empower states to give more concrete effect to their intended bargains, tribunals may still find ways to interpret them narrowly or even in apparent contradiction of their express terms. Grounding the provisions in the fiduciary theory may help resolve some of these weaknesses. By fortifying these exception-style clauses with the fiduciary theory’s familiar philosophical thrust, arbitrators may be able to better understand the state’s intent to protect its population’s human rights. Exceptions clauses do not typically give background information as to why a certain sector or measure is being excepted or excluded. 110 See, e.g. , Free Trade Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People’s Republic of China , June 17, 2015, [2015] ATS 15 (entered into force 20 Dec. 2015) art 9.8.

A preamble or chapeau provides much-needed context, especially where exceptions clauses have had comparatively little to ground their meaning.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The contractual approach also requires negotiating parties to agree to the insertion of these provisions. It is difficult to imagine a state that is not interested in confirming its ability to comply with its international human rights obligations. But as noted above, certain countries are predominantly home to claimants; accordingly, these states may have different incentives and interests to vindicate than states that serve as repeat respondents. 111 See supra Section I.B. Nonetheless, claimant home states are still periodically targets of ISDS.

As the only plenary subjects under international law, 113 See Damrosch, Murphy & Arato, supra note 101, at 259–60. the state owes a protectorate duty to its population, and this approach accordingly prioritizes the state.

Tribunals have hewed to the notion that FET clauses protect a foreign investor’s “legitimate expectations.” 117 Ratner, supra note 29, at 572–73. Put differently, if an investor had a legitimate reason to expect one course of action and the state takes another, the investor may have a valid claim under the constituent treaty’s FET clause. 118 Ugale Anastasiya & Knoll-Tudor Ioana, Legitimate Expectations , Jus Mundi (July 25, 2025), https://jusmundi.com/en/document/publication/en-legitimate-expectations [ perma.cc/ N3QT-E6WM ].

Some arbitral tribunals require a clear promise from a government official to establish a legitimate expectation. 119 Id.

,,,,"Given that international investment law is a legal regime meant to encourage international investment, some might hesitate to embrace an interpretation of IIAs based on the fiduciary theory. Yet the fear that the fiduciary framing of IIAs will chill foreign investment is misplaced. The importance of IIAs to investors rests in their resulting stability and predictability, rather than the particular substantive guarantees that a state provides. For example, some IIAs specify a much more robust definition of FET than others, offering higher standards of protection. 165 Compare Agreement Between Australia and Japan for an Economic Partnership , signed July 8, 2014, [2015] ATS 2 (entered into force Jan. 15, 2015) art. 14.5 (offering the minimum standard of treatment of aliens from customary international law as the benchmark for FET offered to investors) with Agreement Between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Albania on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments , Feb. 13, 1993, art. 3.1, Alb.-‍China, Tiaoyue Ji (providing an unqualified reference to FET).

,,,,"As states increasingly question international investment law’s legitimacy and abandon the regime, it is preferable to investors for the regime to adapt and survive rather than remain rigid and risk collapse. In addition to providing substantive guarantees and stability to investors, IIAs can be win-win policy tools. New-generation IIAs often help to open foreign markets, facilitate investment, promote cooperation, and advance sustainable development goals. 169 See Increasing Dichotomy , supra note 94, at 5. For example, transparency provisions are becoming increasingly common, whereby states commit to the publication and easy access of all laws and regulations potentially relevant to foreign investors. 170 UNCTAD, Investment Facilitation in International Investment Agreements: Trends and Policy Options , IIA Issues Notes , Sep. 2023, at 1, 4, https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcbinf2023d5_en.pdf [perma.cc/TP6X-G7FF].

Int’l Disp. Settlement 24, 25 (2023). Typically, three arbitrators are selected: one by the claimant, one by the respondent, and a chair agreed upon by the two selected arbitrators. Thus, arbitrators are in some ways beholden to their litigants. To be selected for the next arbitration in a system with repeat players, arbitrators may be incentivized to signal sympathies one way or another. 173 Dafina Atanasova, Vincent Beyer & Josef Ostransky, IISD , Compensation and Damages in Investor-State Dispute Settlement 9–10 (2024), https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2024-09/compensation-damages-isds-reform.pdf [ perma.cc/VYR3-7QUP ].",,0,html_body_unmatched

Some scholars and practitioners believe that the remedy to this crisis is to reform the constituent treaties; a viewpoint into which the contractual approach falls. 180 See, e.g. , UNCTAD, Towards a New Generation of International Investment Policies , supra note 93.

Instead, it appears increasingly clear that this system must transform to survive. The latter two vehicles for the fiduciary theory, the judicial and atmospheric frameworks, would particularly complement this change in regime. All the judiciary approach requires to become actionable is amenable arbitrators, which will be more readily available with a standing court of arbitration. Arbitrators not beholden to certain types of parties will be more free to consider the public policy implications of their decisions. The adoption of the atmospheric approach by these arbitrators during this lead-up period will be transformative.
