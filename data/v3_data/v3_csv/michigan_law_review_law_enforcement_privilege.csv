This Article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: The policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege.

This evidentiary privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while concealing how those methods work from the defendants against whom they are used. The privilege is designed to apply to methods that would become ineffective if generally known. It is a qualified privilege, meaning that courts first decide whether the privilege applies and then balance the competing interests in secrecy and disclosure in any given case. 5 Though not always invoked and not always upheld, the privilege has been cited in over eleven hundred federal opinions in the past forty years and has almost certainly successfully concealed police conduct in many more discovery disputes that did not culminate in written opinions. 6",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 In all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

This Article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: The policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure.

38,C. Private-Sector Information,section_header,body_text,"While superficially appealing, a public/private constraint on the privilege is ultimately unpersuasive. The security value of a secret does not depend on whether the government or a private entity possesses it. A leak can destroy a malware exploit regardless of whether law enforcement purchased it or developed it in house. Related doctrines recognize this reality and extend government secrecy powers to shield private-sector information. Information in an investigative file can be privileged even if it came from a private informant. 270 See, e.g. , Capitol Vending Co. v. Baker, 35 F.R.D. 510, 510–11 (D.D.C. 1964) (privilege for “documents that the government is using in connection with an investigation of possible violations of criminal laws” without limitation as to the origins of the documents); Gilbertson v. State, 236 N.W. 539, 540 (Wis. 1931) (privilege for reports and notes of investigations, including “testimony of all persons taken in investigations conducted by the state fire marshal or his deputies”); see also Note, Discovery of Government Documents and the Official Information Privilege , 76 Colum. L. Rev. 142, 158–59 (1976) (discussing courts’ reluctance to order disclosure of law enforcement files while investigations are ongoing). The state secrets privilege extends to military and diplomatic secrets possessed by private contractors. 271 See, e.g. , Crater Corp. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 423 F.3d 1260, 1265–66 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Most federal circuits have held that the FOIA exemption for inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda shields information possessed by private consultants who are working for the government. 272 See Rojas v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 989 F.3d 666 (9th Cir. 2021) (en banc). The Invention Secrecy Act permits the United States Patent and Trademark Office to bar disclosures of private sector inventions that might be “detrimental to the national security.” 273 35 U.S.C. § 181. And under the Atomic Energy Act, information is famously “born secret” 274 Peter Galison, Removing Knowledge , 31 Critical Inquiry 229, 232 (2004). ; the Act automatically classifies nuclear discoveries at inception, even if made by private entities with no government aid or involvement. 275 See Laura K.

Vladeck, eds., forthcoming 2021) (manuscript at 13), http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3450806 . Relatedly, privatization scholars considering whether other (non-secrecy) governmental immunities and constraints should extend to private contractors have repeatedly argued that the dividing line should track the nature of the activity, not the nature of the actor. 276 See, e.g. , Kate Sablosky Elengold & Jonathan D. Glater, The Sovereign in Commerce , 73 Stan. L. Rev. 1101, 1108 (2021); Gillian E. Metzger, Privatization as Delegation , 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1367, 1371 (2003).",,93.10344827586206,matched

Alternately, it could be even riskier to disclose to law enforcement insiders, for whom punishment may be limited to loss of employment and civil liability for breach of contract, than to defense counsel outsiders under a protective order that can be enforced through threat of criminal contempt.

55,"Economics literature helps to explain the significance of such costs. According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals' incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their postdispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article's reform proposal will offer no benefit.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy.

57,CONCLUSION,section_header,body_text,"Of course, the Bishop Atterbury ruling was not binding on United States courts. 217 The fact that an eighteenth-century English treason trial recognized a privilege to withhold relevant evidence based on a “public safety” rationale does not establish that a similar privilege existed in the United States—or even, for that matter, in England in routine law enforcement cases as opposed to national security or treason cases. See 26 Wright, Graham & Murphy , supra note 72, § 5663. But see Russell L. Weaver & James T.R. Jones, The Deliberative Process Privilege , 54 Mo. L. Rev. 279, 284 & n.29 (1989). Atterbury’s case was especially far from binding precedent because it was a Bill of Attainder proceeding in which the standard rules of evidence did not apply, see 16 How. St. Tr. at 560, and the United States Constitution prohibits Bills of Attainder, U.S. Const. art. I, §§ 9–10. Thank you to Judge Stephen Smith for pointing out these facts. Notably, Atterbury’s defense cited “Coleman’s Case” as a precedent in which the government purportedly disclosed a deciphering key, Bishop Atterbury’s Trial (1723) 16 How. St. Tr. at 672–73, and permitted the accused to employ defense experts to challenge the deciphering method, id. at 505. This citation appears to have been mistaken. The reference is most likely to Edward Coleman’s 1678 treason trial before the King’s Bench, in which the prosecution introduced multiple letters as evidence. However, other than translating letters from French to English, there is no indication in the transcript of Coleman’s trial that deciphering was ever at issue. See Edward Coleman’s Trial (1678) 7 How. St. Tr. 1 (KB) (Eng. & Wales). However, it would be a mistake to assume that the privilege recognized there was sui generis . On the contrary, Atterbury’s case shows how very old the policy concerns are that underly the privilege and how improbable that no United States court would have adopted a similar ruling before the mid-twentieth century. Gaps in the archival record make trial court privilege rulings exceedingly challenging to find, both historically and today, and appellate courts appear to have been silent on this issue for most of United States history. Yet it is far more likely that this silence reflected a general acceptance of at least some form of privilege for law enforcement methods than a universal refutation of the same. The clues from historical treatises, early evidence codes, and what case law is available all support the former conclusion.",,100.0,matched

Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties-such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges-require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that 'originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.' 369 That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist. 370",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

There are many other cases with similar results. 49 For instance, in United States v. Clements , a federal district court denied a criminal defendant access to an executable copy of a surveillance software program for testing after the government opposed the defendant’s discovery motion by asserting the law enforcement privilege. The district court reached this finding even though outputs from the software formed the sole evidence of guilt for multiple criminal charges in the case. United States v.

,,,,"Similar issues arise when the prosecution relies on the results of surveillance or forensic technologies as evidence of guilt. This happens even with technologies that police generally use solely for investigative leads. 98 The boundary between surveillance, investigative, and forensic methods is blurry. When the results of a method are introduced as evidence of guilt, the use becomes forensic. See Ferguson, supra note 41, at 837. For instance, consider police use of internet monitoring software to identify computers that appear to be sharing digital contraband. Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect’s home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 See, e.g. , Motion to Compel Discovery at 9, United States v. Clements, No. 15-cr-00275 (N.D. Ohio Jan. 18, 2016), ECF No. 17. When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 See, e.g. , Defendant’s Response to the Government’s Motion in Limine at 3–4, United States v. Chiaradio, No. 09-cr-00069 (D.R.I. Oct. 19, 2010), ECF No. 74. Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 Cf. State v. Pickett, 246 A.3d 279, 298–99 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2021). In all of these circumstances, defendants’ rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102 Cf.

,,,,"Instead, a combination of baseline criminal procedure rules and privilege law mitigate the graymail risk. The baseline criminal procedure rules do so in part by placing strict limits on defendants’ affirmative rights to compel access to information. Importantly, defendants cannot compel access to irrelevant information. Criminal discovery rules require defendants to show that any documents or data they seek from the government are “material to preparing the defense,” 106 Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E); Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 advisory committee’s note to 1966 amend. meaning the information has “more than . . . some abstract logical relationship to the issues in the case” and would enable them “significantly to alter the quantum of proof in [their] favor.” 107 United States v. Ross, 511 F.2d 757, 762–63 (5th Cir. 1975). Criminal subpoenas require defendants to identify information with specificity and to establish in advance that the information is likely to be both relevant and admissible at trial. 108 See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699–700 (1974). And judges have broad discretion to deny harassing or frivolous discovery motions. 109 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 advisory committee’s note to 1966 amendment; Nixon , 418 U.S. at 699–700. If these rules function correctly, defendants will only ever be able to compel access to information about law enforcement investigative methods that is likely to be relevant to their case—even if no privilege applies.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Finally, for certain limited categories of information deemed especially sensitive, privilege law provides additional protections against disclosure, and thereby against graymail as well. These heightened protections impose well-recognized costs on the accuracy and fairness of adjudicatory outcomes because they necessarily suppress relevant evidence from the opposing party, judge, and jury alike. In the Supreme Court’s oft-repeated words, privileges “are in derogation of the search for truth.” 115 United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 710 (1974).

For instance, courts have declined to categorically refute claims that the privilege shields the type of batteries used in an audio recording device, 131 See, e.g. , United States v. Farha, No. 11-CR-115-T-30, 2012 WL 12964913, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 27, 2012). or “the charts, graphs, and raw data” generated during a polygraph examination. 132 Shah v. Dep’t of Just., 714 Fed. App’x. 657, 658 (9th Cir. 2017). Shielding this type of information from adversarial scrutiny can enable tragic misconduct. Consider that, in July 2023, the Third Circuit found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a detective fabricated polygraph evidence, which led to an innocent man’s wrongful eleven-year prison sentence. 133 Mervilus v. Union County, 73 F.4th 185, 192, 195 (3d Cir. 2023). A privilege sweeping enough to encompass polygraph data can prevent that type of misconduct from ever coming to light. Yet critics have complained that courts “apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,” 134 Manes, supra note 13, at 553. and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion. 135 Jonathan Manes has argued that courts evaluating law enforcement privilege claims “often require little if any demonstration that disclosure of the information sought would create a significant risk of circumvention.” Id. at 554.

For instance, the initial Second Circuit case to recognize a distinct law enforcement privilege by that name, In re Department of Investigation , explained that the privilege’s purpose is “to prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures,” 174 In re Dep’t of Investigation, 856 F.2d 481, 483–84 (2d Cir. 1988). but provided no further subject-matter requirements for the privilege to attach and no procedural requirements for claimants to assert it. 175 Id.

Judge Smith provides strong examples in support. For instance, in one case from 1959, Williamson v. United States , the Fifth Circuit considered the location of hidden serial numbers that the FBI used to identify stolen cars. 199 Williamson v. United States, 272 F.2d 495, 496 (5th Cir. 1959). The court held that no prejudice resulted from keeping the location secret, reasoning that there was “nothing to indicate that the location of the serial number would be material” or helpful for impeachment. 200 Id. at 497.

The historical record contains some support for this view.

,,,,"Early cases developed a similar construction of governmental privilege that could easily have applied to law enforcement investigative methods alongside other sensitive information. For instance, in 1903, a federal court for the Western District of Arkansas upheld a privilege for IRS officers’ observations made while discharging official duties. 224 In re Lamberton, 124 F. 446, 451 (W.D. Ark. 1903). In 1931, the Wisconsin Supreme Court recognized a privilege for “such matters as may form the result” of an arson investigation. 225 Gilbertson v. State, 236 N.W. 539, 541 (Wisc. 1931). And in the 1950 case United States v. Coplon , Judge Learned Hand recognized a privilege for concealed FBI wiretap records. 226 United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629, 638 (2d Cir. 1950). Although this well-known case is frequently misread for the questionable proposition that government privileges should always yield in criminal prosecutions, rigorous scrutiny shows that it actually states the opposite and acknowledges governmental privilege in criminal cases despite the harm. He identified the privilege as that for “the names or statements of informers,” and described it as “an instance” of the state secrets privilege. 227 Id. Labels aside, the privilege that Judge Hand recognized applied to a domestic law enforcement method, namely wiretaps. 228 Coplon ultimately held that the prosecution had waived the privilege in that case by submitting the privileged information to the judge to satisfy its burden of proof on a suppression motion, which, in turn, triggered the defendant’s Confrontation Clause right. Id. (“It is, however, one thing to allow the privileged person to suppress the evidence, and, toto coelo , another thing to allow him to fill a gap in his own evidence by recourse to what he suppresses.”). Readers of Coplon may be thrown by Judge Hand’s reference to his prior opinion in United States v. Andolschek , in which he stated that: [s]o far as [privileged documents] directly touch the criminal dealings, the prosecution necessarily ends any confidential character the documents may possess . . . . The government must choose; either it must leave the transactions in the obscurity from which a trial will draw them, or it must expose them fully. 142 F.2d 503, 506 (2d Cir. 1944). The documents at issue in Andolschek would arguably qualify as Brady material today because the criminal prosecution in that case was “founded upon those very dealings to which the [privileged] documents relate, and whose criminality they will, or may, tend to exculpate.” Id. at 506. The fact that privileges must yield to countervailing constitutional rights such as Brady or the Confrontation Clause does not negate their existence or force in other circumstances. To be sure, Judge Hand conceded that “[t]his privilege will often impose a grievous hardship, for it may deprive parties . . . to criminal prosecutions of power to assert their rights or to defend themselves.” 229 Coplon , 185 F.2d at 638.

,,,,"Even the case about hidden vehicle serial numbers on which Judge Smith relies, Williamson v. United States , contains contrary evidence of a privilege. Judge Smith is correct that the Fifth Circuit relied on immateriality to shield the numbers’ secret location. Yet the trial court transcript from the National Archives tells a different story. The prosecution’s objection at the 1959 trial was that “it would be against public policy to require the public disclosure of the location of an automobile’s confidential serial number, since the purpose of a confidential number is to make it difficult for car thieves to conceal thefts by altering these numbers.” 231 Brief for the United States in Opposition at 6, Williamson v. United States, 362 U.S. 920 (1960) (No. 698) (emphasis added). Once again, privileges are public policy based rules for excluding evidence, so the prosecution’s objection was implicitly a privilege claim. 232 While a party’s objection at trial does not carry precedential weight, it reflects litigants’ presumptions about the existence of privileges and suggests that the trial court may have ruled based on a privilege rationale. Since evidence practice exists primarily in the trial courts, the perspectives of litigants and trial judges are an indication of common practice. Indeed, California courts have protected the same hidden vehicle serial numbers under the state’s statutory “official information privilege” since at least 1976. 233 People v.

Vagueness invites law enforcement to overclaim the privilege, whether to conceal mistakes and negligence, to hide unlawful and unconstitutional conduct, or simply to avoid the hassle and inconvenience of having investigative methods challenged in court. As one federal judge opined, “[i]n a society where government is supposed to be open, where it is supposed to be the servant of and responsive to the people . . . does it make sense for courts to create a body of privilege doctrine that sweeps so broadly[?]” 279 Kelly v.

Second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access. Here is a simple procedure to do so. Courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford.

While both post-dispute courtroom testimony and pre-dispute conduct can be falsified, the motive to falsify is likely to increase once litigation begins. Institutionally, relying on the pre-dispute conduct would leverage law enforcement’s security expertise to assist judicial review, transforming a comparative weakness of the courts into a boon. Procedurally, evidence about the conduct could be adjudicated publicly in fully adversarial hearings without revealing the allegedly privileged information. Parties could create more robust records for appeal. Courts could develop common-law reasoning about how best to evaluate this type of evidence. Legislative, regulatory, and civilian oversight commissions could learn more about police practices. 306 See generally Sharon R.

,,,,"Normatively, this approach would discourage courts from presuming defense counsel and their experts are untrustworthy while giving police and prosecutors the benefit of the doubt. To be sure, defense attorneys have leaked information in some cases. 307 See, e.g. , United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 109–10 (2d Cir. 2009); Bob Egelko, Lawyer Admits Leaking Balco Testimony / He Agrees to Plead Guilty—Prosecutors Say They’ll End Effort to Jail Reporters , SFGate (Feb. 14, 2007), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/LAWYER-ADMITS-LEAKING-BALCO-TESTIMONY-He-agrees-2617522.php [ perma.cc/UX2K-B88J ].

Fortunately, these known incidents are few and far between. 309 If defense counsel regularly breached protective orders, one would expect prosecutors to produce evidence of that fact whenever they argue against disclosure. They do not. And while defense counsel’s duty of zealous advocacy might indicate a higher risk compared to law enforcement’s more generalized duties to the public, 310 Compare Eric S. Fish, Against Adversary Prosecution , 103 Iowa L. Rev. 1419, 1467 (2018), with Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., Beyond Justifications: Seeking Motivations to Sustain Public Defenders , 106 Harv. L. Rev. 1239, 1246–47 (1993). other facts suggest the risks may be equivalent: Both law enforcement and defense counsel can be subject to disciplinary sanction, both operate within a range of institutional structures and oversight mechanisms, and many defense counsel, like law enforcement, are public employees. Alternately, it could be even riskier to disclose to law enforcement insiders, for whom punishment may be limited to loss of employment and civil liability for breach of contract, than to defense counsel outsiders under a protective order that can be enforced through threat of criminal contempt. Without empirical evidence establishing that defense counsel and their experts are less trustworthy than law enforcement and their contractors, there is no good reason for courts to categorically favor one over the other without consideration of individual factors on a case-by-case basis.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Although law enforcement privilege doctrine has thus far failed to focus on pre-dispute confidentiality, doing so would be far from unprecedented. One cannot generally share information willy-nilly and then turn around and claim that it is privileged in court. On the contrary, a pre-dispute “reasonable expectation of confidentiality” is an essential element of many nongovernmental privileges, such as the attorney-client, spousal, clergy-penitent, and psychotherapist-patient privileges. 320 Edward J. Imwinkelried, The Dangerous Trend Blurring the Distinction Between a Reasonable Expectation of Confidentiality in Privilege Law and a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Fourth Amendment Jurisprudence , 57 Loy. L. Rev. 1, 3 (2011). Scholars have theorized certain aspects of this requirement. Prominently, Wigmore characterized it as an incentive for people in privileged relationships to communicate. 321 See, e.g. , Edward J. Imwinkelried, The New Wigmore: An Essay on Rethinking the Foundation of Evidentiary Privileges , 83 B.U. L. Rev. 315, 319–20 (2003). More recently, scholars have questioned whether it valuably limits the scope of privilege protections 322 E.g. , Melanie B. Leslie, The Costs of Confidentiality and the Purpose of Privilege , 2000 Wis. L. Rev . 31 (2001). or conflicts with peoples’ actual perceptions about their communications (and should thus be abolished). 323 E.g. , Paul R. Rice, A Bad Idea Dying Hard: A Reply to Professor Leslie’s Defense of the Indefensible , 2001 Wis. L. Rev. 187 (2001); Paul R. Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege: The Eroding Concept of Confidentiality Should be Abolished , 47 Duke L.J. 853 (1998). Still other scholars have untangled its relationship to the reasonable expectations of privacy test in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. 324 E.g. , Imwinkelreid, supra note 320; Robert P. Mosteller & Kenneth S. Broun, The Danger to Confidential Communications in the Mismatch Between the Fourth Amendment’s “Reasonable Expectation of Privacy” and the Confidentiality of Evidentiary Privileges , 32 Campbell L.

,,,,"There is another explanation: The confidentiality requirement is an information-forcing function; it serves as a signal for the value of secrecy that can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without exposing the allegedly privileged information. 325 Whether communicants spoke in a room with others present, closed a door or window, used encrypted email, or otherwise undertook reasonable efforts to block eavesdroppers, can often be determined without revealing the contents of the communications themselves.

,,,,"Similarly, trade secret claimants must show that, pre-dispute, they undertook reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of their alleged intellectual property. 326 Trade secret claims brought under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Uniform Trade Secret Act must establish that trade secret holders undertook reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of their alleged trade secrets. Defend Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3); Unif. Trade Secrets Act , § 1(4) (amended 1985), 14 U.L.A. 437 (1990). For instance, the Ninth Circuit invalidated a trade secret because a company failed to take reasonable secrecy precautions when it permitted employees to remove information from the premises and to retain possession after their employment ended. 327 See Buffets, Inc., v. Klinke, 73 F.3d 965, 969–70 (9th Cir. 1996). (Compare that ruling to Budziak , in which no court considered the FBI’s similar conduct when assessing its claim to the law enforcement privilege. 328 See supra notes 142–148 and accompanying text. ) Scholars have debated various justifications for this “reasonable efforts” component of trade secret law. 329 Theories range from characterizing the requirement as a vestige of common-law property rights, to a notice mechanism to avoid unintentional misappropriation, to a means of balancing the costs and benefits of protecting intellectual property versus disseminating knowledge. See Robert G. Bone, Trade Secrecy, Innovation and the Requirement of Reasonable Secrecy Precautions , in The Law and Theory of Trade Secrets: A Handbook of Contemporary Research 46, 52 (Rochelle C.

To name just a few, in a well-developed analysis of the distinction between deep and shallow secrecy, David Pozen observes that “how many people know of [the secret], what sorts of people know, how much they know, and [when] they know” can help to “describe, assess, and compare secrets, without having to judge what they conceal.” 331 David E. Pozen, Deep Secrecy , 62 Stan. L. Rev . 257, 257, 267 (2010).

When courts review law enforcement secrets in camera, the government sometimes imposes onerous confidentiality requirements on the judge. 347 See generally Robert Timothy Reagan , Fed. Jud.

Papers might be delivered to a judge by a special agent handcuffed to their briefcase. The judge might be required to close the window shades before viewing documents. Alternately, the judge might have to travel to a secure location to view the records. These types of requirements can intimidate a judge who is considering ordering disclosure. Knowing whether law enforcement has previously imposed the same conditions on its own officers could help judges distinguish genuine security concerns from security theater that might unduly sway their decisions.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"Alternately, what if information is not truly sensitive, and law enforcement has unnecessarily secured it? Officers engaged in knowing fraud or misconduct already have incentives to conceal. Meanwhile, this Article’s proposed reform could incentivize greater secrecy among well-meaning officers as well. Law enforcement agencies might respond to the reform by routinely making everything extra confidential.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Once again, there are a few responses. To start, law enforcement’s conduct should set a floor, not a ceiling, for transparency. That is how most nongovernmental privileges and trade secret laws already work. One must show a reasonable expectation of confidentiality to claim the attorney-client, spousal, clergy-penitent, or psychotherapist-patient privilege. But doing so does not guarantee privilege protection. 353 See, e.g. , Imwinkelreid, supra note 320, at 4, 14. So too, showing reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy is necessary but not sufficient for a trade secret claim. 354 See supra note 326 and accompanying text. Similar logic should apply to law enforcement secrecy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Next, to the extent that law enforcement’s institutional incentives lean toward secrecy, using law enforcement’s pre-dispute conduct as a proxy will offer a conservative estimate of an acceptable risk of leaks. Courts should thus feel more confident about ordering disclosure under protective-order safeguards that match or exceed what law enforcement previously imposed. Of course, this practice may result in unnecessarily burdensome protective orders. 355 Cf. State v. Pickett, 246 A.3d, 279, 290–91 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2021) (holding that a protective order making defendant’s source code available for independent review was unnecessary where the state did not intend to review it). Even so, it would improve over the total nondisclosure that often happens today.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Meanwhile, maintaining confidentiality has costs of its own that will predictably discourage law enforcement from adopting excessive precautions. Maintaining confidentiality may require limiting the number of people who can use an investigative technique or otherwise constraining the circumstances of its use. It may present obstacles for collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners. It may require routine tracking of sensitive information, demanding the return or destruction of information following use, or independent investigations and disciplinary actions to enforce against unauthorized disclosures. Cumulatively, such costs could be substantial.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Economics literature helps to explain the significance of such costs. According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 Michael Spence, Signaling in Retrospect and the Informational Structure of Markets , 92 Amer. Econ. Rev . 434, 436–37 (2002). To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 Id. at 437. For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement’s pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence’s theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Concededly, officers engaged in knowing fraud or misconduct present the most challenging case because these individuals will find ex ante secrecy so valuable. Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals’ incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their post-dispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article’s reform proposal will offer no benefit.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Each of these reasons may well help to account for the current state of law enforcement privilege doctrine. Vagueness in the doctrine provides cover for deference. Deference, in turn, enables judges to avoid uncomfortable and time-consuming decisions. By maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes. Put succinctly, secrecy can forestall entire lines of motion practice that would otherwise clog dockets and force difficult rulings. 360 Cf. Aziz Z. Huq, Judicial Independence and the Rationing of Constitutional Remedies , 65 Duke L.J. 1, 67–68 (2015).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to conclude that there is no hope for judge-made doctrine to bound the law enforcement privilege more reasonably.

Rev . 505, 540–42 (2001). Secrecy concerning law enforcement investigative techniques does not entirely eliminate docket-clogging motions or thorny legal and constitutional issues. Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy. Even if investigative methods are disclosed under a strict protective order, the judge’s conclusions as to their lawfulness and reliability need not be. Regardless of the overarching institutional incentives of the judiciary, some individual judges will wish to engage in a more probing review of law enforcement secrecy claims.

Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties—such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges—require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 See, e.g. , Imwinkelried, supra note 321, at 319–20. He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that “originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.” 369 8 John Henry Wigmore , Evidence in Trials at Common Law § 2285 (McNaughton rev. 1961) (emphasis omitted).
