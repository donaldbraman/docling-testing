That is, until now, the Supreme Court has never had an opportunity to consider Spending Clause and state standing jurisprudence together. And for good reason: In cases applying Pennhurst ’s clear-notice requirement, nongovernmental plaintiffs (who were not involved in the grant of federal funds) were actively bringing suit and the defendants (recipients of federal funds) used the clear-notice rule as a defense to their liability. 158 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.

Furthermore, in Dole and Sebelius , there was no question that the relevant legislation’s spending conditions directly affected and injured the state plaintiffs. 159 See Vladeck, supra note 25, at 862–63. The Eleventh Circuit opinion in the broader Sebelius litigation did consider a challenge to the state-plaintiffs’ standing, but not on the Spending Clause issue. Florida ex rel. Att’y Gen. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 648 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2011).

4,"Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). 1 The $1.9 trillion ARPA was meant to do more than stop the bleeding-it contained unemployment insurance, food assistance, child tax credit funding, and more programs meant to usher in a new era of robust public spending. 2 One such ARPA program, the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF), provided certain non-federal government entities almost $220 billion to 'mitigate the fiscal effects' of the pandemic. 3 The CSLFRF empowered states and local governments to spend on programs of their own choosing 4 -granting recipients wide discretion, but not a blank check. Indeed, the program contained one key limitation: the tax 'Offset Provision.' Recipients could spend the new money on nearly anything, but they could not use it to 'directly or indirectly offset' their taxes. 5 If they did, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) could 'recoup' the impermissibly spent funds. 6",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something-anything-'sovereign' enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on 'dubious' and 'lawless' standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them.

Instead, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries should adhere to the touchstones of other standing injuries-in-fact, requiring objective imminence and concreteness, respectively. As standing doctrine is theoretically supposed to ensure, the Spending Clause has historically been free from federal courts’ excessive meddling in highly sensitive political areas. 251 Gould, supra note 24, at 269. Instead, with the Offset Provision cases, the majority of the circuit courts hearing those cases have welcomed the crushing weight of “juristocracy” to yet another policy vehicle, inviting disruptive judicial activism to infect another Article I power. 252 See Moyn, supra note 27. Although the merits (or existence) of judicial activism is subject to academic debate, modern judicial involvement in these kinds of federalist disputes tends to bias conservative policymakers.

Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a 'sovereign' policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
21,II. THE OFFSET PROVISION CASES,section_header,body_text,"The Offset Provision cases were the perfect storm for a messy circuit split. ARPA was a highly political bill, the Offset Provision was complicated, and $200 billion were on the line. One legal doctrine at issue—standing—is inundated with inconsistency. The other—spending—is bereft of case law: a nascent jurisprudence likely to develop as Congress continues to rely on it. The Offset Provision cases were an intricate first attempt at conceptualizing together the two previously unwed doctrines. The fruits of the courts’ analyses, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearly every case—regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments. The sovereign Spending Clause injuries are powerful tools: pleading strategies for ambitious states to destroy the federal policies they oppose. Spending Clause standing must have a higher standard, and special solicitude must not become a renewed red carpet for state plaintiffs.",,96.66666666666667,matched

One legal doctrine at issue-standing-is inundated with inconsistency. The other-spending-is bereft of case law: a nascent jurisprudence likely to develop as Congress continues to rely on it. The Offset Provision cases were an intricate first attempt at conceptualizing together the two previously unwed doctrines. The fruits of the courts' analyses, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearly every case-regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments. The sovereign Spending Clause injuries are powerful tools: pleading strategies for ambitious states to destroy the federal policies they oppose.

The CSLFRF empowered states and local governments to spend on programs of their own choosing 4 42 U.S.C. §§ 802–806. —granting recipients wide discretion, but not a blank check. Indeed, the program contained one key limitation: the tax “Offset Provision.” Recipients could spend the new money on nearly anything, but they could not use it to “directly or indirectly offset” their taxes. 5 42 U.S.C. § 802(c)(2)(A).

,,,,"Although it is true that states suffer some form of sovereign injury when Congress exceeds its spending power, most of the Offset Provision decisions are simply too broad. An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something—anything—“sovereign” enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on “dubious” and “lawless” standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 See Vladeck, supra note 15; Steve Vladeck, Bonus 35: The Lawlessness of Missouri’s Standing in Biden v.

For example, a state could not cut its property taxes and use the CSLFRF funds to make up the difference. As professors Conor Clarke and Edward Fox explain, the Offset Provision is a variation on “maintenance-of-effort” provisions common in federal education programs designed to ensure that federal money “supplements and not supplants” state spending. 45 See Conor Clarke & Edward Fox, No New Tax Cuts? Examining the Rescue Plan’s New State Tax Limits , 103 Tax Notes State 1361, 1362 (2022). Interestingly enough, unlike other maintenance-of-effort provisions, Clarke and Fox argue that the Offset Provision is a far more flexible constraint than those in prior versions of the provision, ensuring that more federal dollars are used to support state and local governments than an equivalent “earmarked” spending program. 46 See id. at 1364–66.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Halderman , courts evaluate the second prong according to the “clear notice” canon of statutory interpretation. 75 See Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17; see also Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 300 (2006). The solution is not for courts to entirely strike down ambiguous provisions. 76 Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985) (holding that the federal government simply cannot “prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity” in the structure of a grant program). Instead, when interpreting relevant spending conditions, a court must fill the shoes of the funds’ recipient (here, a state) at the time it chose to accept the deal and ask whether the state “would clearly understand” its statutory obligations and liabilities. 77 Arlington , 548 U.S. at 296. The spending condition is still enforced but in a way that the states could have fairly anticipated. The Court’s clear notice rule for the second prong helps facilitate federalism by ensuring the spending conditions are enforced in unsurprising ways.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The “fifth” prong—the prohibition against coercion—can affirmatively invalidate an unconstitutional spending condition. The bar on congressional coercion was decisive in dismantling the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion provisions in National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius . 78 Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012). There, “ for the first time ever ,” 79 Id. at 625 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). the Court held that Congress could not threaten the loss of existing Medicaid funds if states did not accept the new Medicaid funds. 80 Rotunda et al. , supra note 69, § 5.7(a)(ii)(6). Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion for the Court explained that although the congressional spending power is broad, the “financial inducement” to encourage state participation in expanded Medicaid was an unconstitutional “gun to the head.” 81 Sebelius , 567 U.S. at 580–81 (quoting South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Roberts was not precise as to what exactly was the decisive, coercive factor that pushed the ACA over the constitutional limit, 82 E.g. , id. at 581–82 (highlighting the significant percentage existing Medicaid funding makes up in state budgets). but the prevailing hypothesis is that it was Congress’s choice to leverage existing , as opposed to new , funding. 83 See Samuel R. Bagenstos, The Anti-Leveraging Principle and the Spending Clause After NFIB, 101 Geo. L.J. 861, 865 (2013).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Nonetheless, given the Spending Clause’s flexibility, Congress increasingly relies on appropriating funds to achieve its policymaking goals in lieu of other Article I powers subject to the Senate filibuster, political polarization, and other constitutional impediments. 84 See Gould, supra note 24, at 220–31. Congressional reliance on spending should not be mistaken for abuse. Professor Jonathan Gould explains that in recent decades, Congress’s ability to regulate through other Article I powers has faced greater challenges under judicial review, with the Supreme Court crafting limitations on Congress’s interstate commerce power and in other constitutional doctrines such as anticommandeering and nondelegation. 85 Id. at 250–52. For better or worse, the Spending Clause is one of the federal government’s few remaining means to reliably effectuate welfarist policies on a national scale. Furthermore, even in the hands of a Congress uninterested in redistributive policies, the fourth prong of Dole —that spending conditions cannot require states to engage in unconstitutional behavior—prevents serious threats against individual liberties. 86 South Dakota v.

The Court’s disinterest in enforcement likely results from the greater agency a state has when Congress creates a spending program as opposed to exercising another federal power: Instead of simple preemption by federal fiat, a state can say no to the contract. 88 See Dole , 483 U.S. at 210. Politics at both state and federal governing levels—not Article III courts—decide whether a state adopts a policy. Rather than involving itself in every political disagreement, the federal judiciary should step in only when necessary to ensure “healthy federalism”—when Congress has actually violated Dole (or Sebelius ).

Rev. 163, 179–86 (1992). standing is rooted in Article III’s vague articulation of the “judicial Power” of the United States. 90 13A Wright & Miller’s Federal Practice and Procedure § 3531 n.12 (ed. Ed. 1998) [hereinafter Wright & Miller ]; U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. The Constitution extends the judicial power to specified “Cases” and “Controversies,” a phrase the Supreme Court has interpreted to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to only “ actual cases or controversies.” 91 U.S. Const. art.

State judicial systems typically have their own standing rules. Wright & Miller , supra note 90, § 3531 n.1. Federal courts do not issue advisory opinions, 92 See Gene R. Nichol, Jr., Rethinking Standing , 72 Calif. L. Rev. 68, 91–92 (1984); Felix Frankfurter, A Note on Advisory Opinions , 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1002 (1924). and there is no standing “when there are no adverse parties with personal interest in the matter.” 93 Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers , 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983). To eliminate plaintiffs and disputes without “proper” stakes, plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they have suffered an “injury in fact,” (2) the injury is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s challenged conduct, and (3) the injury is “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” 94 Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"At its core, standing is rooted in separation-of-powers concerns. 95 Scalia, supra note 93, at 881. Standing circumscribes “what activities are appropriate” for Article III courts, an “irreducible constitutional minimum” for when a federal judge can grant jurisdiction and get involved. 96 Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559–60 (1992). A court must refuse to resolve even a potentially meritorious claim if the plaintiff is “not properly situated to be entitled to its judicial determination.” 97 Wright & Miller , supra note 90. As then-Judge Scalia phrased it in his influential article on the subject, standing “is an answer to the very first question that is sometimes rudely asked when one person complains of another’s actions: ‘What’s it to you?’ ” 98 Scalia, supra note 93, at 882.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The Supreme Court has described the requirements for injury in myriad ways, 101 E.g. , Steel Co. , 523 U.S. at 103–04 (injury in fact); Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923) (direct injury); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996) (actual injury). boiling the concept down to a number of essential characteristics: The plaintiff’s injury must be “concrete,” “particularized,” and sufficiently “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” 102 Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339–40 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).",,0,html_body_unmatched

Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 999 F.3d 1247, 1261–64 (11th Cir. 2021). The question of risk is most relevant where there is a hypothetical, illegal government enforcement of a law—but no actual enforcement. Plaintiffs have “pre-enforcement” standing for such threatened injuries when they allege “an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,” and there is a “credible threat” that a governmental actor will stop them from doing so. 104 Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014) (quoting Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)). A threat is credible when it is “certainly impending” or there is a “substantial risk” of future harm. 105 Id. at 158 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 n.5 (2013)). Justice Alito’s Clapper opinion initially relegated the pre-enforcement standard of “substantial risk” of harm to the footnote later cited in Driehaus , relying instead on the heftier “certainly impending” standard. See Clapper , 568 U.S. at 409–14. Like so many areas of standing doctrine, the cases in this “future injury” vein are messy: Precisely when the harm is certain 106 See, e.g. , Clapper , 568 U.S. at 410; City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101–03 (1983); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

,,,,"State governments asserting claims in federal courts possess unique standing opportunities as opposed to private plaintiffs. 109 See generally Wright, Miller & Cooper , supra note 90, § 3531.11.1 (comparing state standing to private standing). When asserting proprietary or private injuries, states are held to the same tripartite standing rule as all plaintiffs. 110 See id. But, by virtue of their independent character, states can also assert “sovereign” and “quasi-sovereign” injuries otherwise unavailable to private individuals. 111 Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601–02 (1982). A state’s quasi-sovereign interests and injuries arise from its citizens’ wellbeing. 112 Id. at 602. The state, in those instances, asserts parens patriae standing on behalf of its citizens. 113 Id. at 600–02. Parens patriae means “parent of the country.” States may not assert these quasi-sovereign injuries, however, against the federal government in federal court, as the federal government “represents [the state’s people] as parens patriae [] when such representation becomes appropriate.” Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485–86 (1923). States, however, also directly suffer sovereign injuries as a result of their unique character and not as a result of broader injuries to their citizens. 114 Alfred L. Snapp , 458 U.S. at 601. The earliest recognized examples of such direct sovereign interests include “the exercise of sovereign power over individuals and entities” and “the demand for recognition from other sovereigns,” including other states. 115 Id.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Court disagreed, holding Massachusetts’s asserted injury—that “rising seas” would “swallow Massachusetts’ coastal land”—was sufficiently concrete and particularized for standing. 122 Id. at 521–23. Although the Court did credit the proprietary, non-sovereign ramifications of coastal flooding vis-a-vis Massachusetts as a landowner, 123 Id. at 523. Justice Stevens’s majority opinion also factored Massachusetts’s status as a state into the Court’s standing analysis. 124 See Fallon, supra note 108, at 1104, 1110. Distinguishing previous environmental cases where private plaintiffs lacked standing, Stevens asserted that “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.” 125 Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 518. Because the states “surrender[ed] certain sovereign prerogatives” to the federal government when they entered the Union, they are “entitled to special solicitude in [the Court’s] standing analysis.” 126 Id. at 519–20 (emphasis added).

,,,,"Precisely how to apply special solicitude (or even how it functioned in Massachusetts ) 128 Professor Katherine Crocker discusses the many doctrinal issues with Massachusetts v. EPA and special solicitude, including, among other things: (1) Massachusetts’s coastal injury was arguably proprietary, theoretically not requiring any special solicitude; (2) the majority conflated sovereign and quasi-sovereign injuries throughout its explanation of special solicitude. See Katherine Mims Crocker, Not-So-Special Solicitude , 109 Minn. L. Rev. 815, 827–31, 836–37, 843 (2024). has vexed scholars ever since. 129 See, e.g. , id. at 831 nn.70–71. Does special solicitude mean that states can broadly shirk any of standing’s general requirements? 130 See id. at 832 n.74 (collecting scholarly perspectives on the different forms of standing extra-credit special solicitude offers). Does it create an ever-expanding list of sovereign and quasi-sovereign injuries unavailable to private plaintiffs? 131 See id. at 831–32. Since 2007, the Supreme Court has not explicitly granted a state standing on special solicitude grounds, despite a number of close calls. 132 See id. at 841–43; United States v.

Gorsuch pointed out that special solicitude had not “played a meaningful role in this Court’s decisions in the years since [ Massachusetts v. EPA ].” 134 Id. at 1977–78. Further, he continued, “it’s hard not to think, too, that lower courts should just leave that idea on the shelf . . . .” 135 Id. In dissent, Justice Alito, relying on Massachusetts to support Texas’s standing claim, questioned if the majority opinion had “quietly interred” special solicitude. 136 Id. at 1997 (Alito, J., dissenting) (citing Justice Gorsuch’s concurring opinion).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Special solicitude, then, appears on its way out. Since Massachusetts v. EPA , scholars have failed to characterize what special solicitude was or should be. 137 See, e.g. , Fallon, supra note 108, at 1104–10 (arguing that standing’s “fragmentation” had created a diverse array of distinct doctrines, including for state standing rules in the wake of Massachusetts v. EPA ); Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1745. Professor Katherine Crocker argues that this is for the best: Special solicitude lacked serious doctrinal rigor and has not been the source of the “extraordinary scope that some cases accord sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests.” 138 See Crocker supra note 128.

EPA until the end of June 2023, analyzing them to show that special solicitude did not play a decisive role in any case.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In recent decades, state attorneys general have ramped up their attacks on federal law. 139 See Note, An Abdication Approach to State Standing , 132 Harv. L. Rev. 1301, 1306–08 (2019). For politically motivated state officials, expansive state standing postMassachusetts v.

Nebraska reveals that the Court still has a soft-spot for state plaintiffs. 148 Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023). There, a 6–3 Court found that Missouri had standing to challenge President Biden’s student loan forgiveness program for the harm that program would do to an independent government corporation (which itself had no interest in challenging the forgiveness plan), because that corporation was a “public instrumentality” of the state. 149 Id. at 2365–68. Despite the corporation’s “financial and legal independence” 150 Id. at 2388. from Missouri—and the corporation’s ability to bring suit itself—the Court’s analysis ignored the core limitations that have animated standing doctrine for decades. 151 Id. at 2400 (Kagan, J., dissenting). As Justice Kagan explained in dissent, the Court’s standing decision circumvented the political process and resolved a controversial policy matter itself. 152 Id.

A majority of the courts hearing the Offset Provision cases—likely drawing from their underlying, merits-based views of the Spending Clause—found standing for state plaintiffs in every instance of congressional ambiguity.

Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes—in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a “sovereign” policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"The Spending Contract injury describes how ambiguous or coercive federal spending conditions impose an intangible (and potentially ongoing) injury to state sovereignty. At its core, the injury is based on the contractual rules of Dole and Pennhurst : State plaintiffs are injured when the federal government “offers” money with conditions (here, the Offset Provision) that violate the Spending Clause. 181 See Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 851–52 (“When Congress does not meet one of these [Spending Clause] criteria, and say, extends a federal grant with ambiguous or coercive terms to the States, Arizona contends that this offer offends state sovereignty and gives rise to a cognizable injury in fact. We agree.”). Although articulated in slightly different ways, the common thread for this injury is the bad contract—either because the states could not understand the Offset Provision or because it was inherently coercive. 182 See id. , 34 F.4th at 847; Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1135–36; Missouri v. Yellen , 39 F.4th at 1069 (alleging that a broad interpretation of the Offset Provision harmed Missouri’s “interest” in the offer); Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th 983, 988 (6th Cir. 2022) (arguing Ohio “was forced to ‘ponder accepting an ambiguous deal’ ”); Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 764 (5th Cir. 2024) (noting Supreme Court precedent where states had standing to prevent coercive Spending Clause offers). As the Ninth Circuit articulated:",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The circuits disagreed on when a Spending Contract injury occurs. In the previous Spending Clause cases, there were no standing disputes based on what a spending condition meant or when it would be enforced. 184 See supra Section I.D. Now, courts had to answer: Did the injury require imminence of federal enforcement, or could states challenge the spending condition at any time?",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits indicated that imminence of injury was not required for the state to have standing. All three circuits found standing for the asserted Spending Contract sovereign injuries. 185 All three Circuit Courts also found pre-enforcement standing for a Driehaus injury. Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 848–53; Morrisey , 59 F.4th 1135–38; Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th at 764–65. The Fifth Circuit was not explicit about requisite imminence, but it linked the Spending Contract injury to the “offer” stage of the contract. 186 See Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th at 764. That court held that because the state plaintiffs are, under their professed interpretation of the Offset Provision, coerced into a “double bind” of bad choices (take the money with an ambiguous condition or miss out on the money entirely), they have standing to challenge the law. 187 Id. at 764. Citing Sebelius , the court stressed its role in arbitrating “[c]oercion in the bargaining process” in the contractual world of the Spending Clause. 188 Id. The Fifth Circuit’s finding that the injury manifests as soon as Congress extends its coercive offer suggests no imminent recoupment is required. 189 Id. at 765.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Ninth Circuit likewise believed the Spending Contract injury did not require any imminent agency enforcement. However, it is difficult to say whether the Ninth Circuit is in step with the Fifth Circuit because Arizona v. Yellen held in the alternative that the Treasury’s recoupment was sufficiently imminent to allow for pre-enforcement standing on nonsovereign grounds. 190 Arizona v. Yellen , 34 F.4th at 848–51. But the court specifically tied the Spending Contract injury to a spending condition (the Offset Provision) that clouded the offer of federal funds, as opposed to the enforcement of that condition, meaning that no enforcement would actually be required. 191 See id. at 852. The intangible injury to a state’s “ability to exercise” its sovereign judgment and fairly accept or reject Congress’s “quasi-contractual funding offer,” allows the state to challenge unconstitutional terms “at the outset.” 192 Id. Moreover, Arizona’s case was not mooted even after its acceptance of the CSLFRF. 193 See id. at 852–53 (noting that Arizona’s acceptance of the funds is a factor for the merits, not justiciability). In his concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson seemed to confirm that the Ninth Circuit’s conception of the Spending Contract injury did not require imminence. 194 See id. at 853–54 (Nelson, J., concurring) (disagreeing that Treasury enforcement was imminent but agreeing that Arizona had “sovereign injury” standing).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For these imminence-free conceptions of the Spending Clause, standing determinations are substituted with the courts’ ultimate views of the merits. The Eleventh and Fifth Circuits’ articulations of the Spending Contract injury are largely drawn from their shared understanding of policing ambiguity under the Spending Clause. 199 See infra Section I.A. In stark contrast to the settled case law on the question, these courts create a free-standing right for states to enjoin any ambiguity in federal spending legislation: If a spending condition is ambiguous, it violates the Spending Clause. 200 Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 774 (5th Cir. 2024) (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)); Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1142. For these courts, the limitation on ambiguity in the Spending Clause is an affirmative cause of action, not simply a part of the clear-statement rule. 201 See Eloise Pasachoff, Conditional Spending After NFIB v. Sebelius : The Example of Federal Education Law , 62 Am. U. L. Rev. 557, 589 (2013). Given the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits’ aggressive conception of Pennhurst , standing without imminence makes some sense. As Professor Richard Fallon explains, a court’s “substantive judgments” about the constitutional right at issue—here, a state’s right to be free from Spending Clause ambiguity or coercion—are often decisive in touch-and-go standing determinations. 202 Fallon, supra note 108, at 1095–96.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This conception of injury under the Spending Clause hamstrings the federal government’s ability to answer impending catastrophe. Consider a hypothetical climate change bill: With the future of executive agency deference in question, 203 See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024). Congress decides to invoke its spending power to fund green energy initiatives through the states. Congress does not want to hamper the state with specifics; states can use discretionary funds to answer local needs if they implement “reasonable” emission limits on local companies. Under the broad Spending Contract rule, ambiguity in the word “reasonable” would immediately invalidate the spending condition, even if the overseeing agency had no plans to enforce the requirement. Environmental bills, perpetually under scrutiny for their ambiguity, 204 See, e.g. , West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022); see also Patrick Boyle & Charles Slidders, The End of US Environmental Protection Regulation as We Know It , Ctr. for Int’l Env’t L.: Blog (Aug. 5, 2024), https://ciel.org/the-end-of-environmental-protection-regulation-as-we-know-it [ perma.cc/MNL7-LUF5 ] (discussing how ambiguity in environmental statutes has made regulating under those statutes subject to constant litigation and upheaval). might be entirely off-limits to the Spending Clause. As federal legislation continues to operate through the spending power, 205 See Gould, supra note 24, at 212. Congress would face an impossible task of addressing major social issues by granting states enough discretion without using ambiguous language.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The circuit majority’s approach—not requiring imminence—comports with at least one scholarly conception of special solicitude. 206 See Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1749–50. Professor Bulman-Pozen argues that state suits against federal agencies (and expansive state standing to facilitate those suits) are desirable to ensure that federal officials “come to the table” and bargain with the states on the terms of that federal policy. 207 Id. at 1749. Bulman-Pozen’s argument is not based on the sovereignty of the state plaintiff—she concedes Massachusetts v. EPA ’s confirmation that states have lost their sovereign prerogatives to the federal government. 208 See id. at 1747–48. Rather, it is based on her general view of federalism as a means to ventilate partisan disputes and create “deliberation-generating froth in our democratic system.” 209 See Bulman-Pozen & Gerken, supra note 144, at 1284; Jessica Bulman-Pozen, Partisan Federalism , 127 Harv. L. Rev. 1077, 1080 (2014). States, without their traditional autonomy, need a legal environment that can help facilitate this bargaining. 210 Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1740–41. The expansive version of the Spending Contract injury would do just that. In some ways, the belabored analogy comparing spending legislation to contractual formation would take on new meaning: Congress and the states would have to shake hands and come to a mutual agreement on the terms of the federal grants.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"By contrast, the Sixth and Eighth Circuits both implicitly required imminent recoupment, thereby rejecting standing for sovereign injuries. 211 Judge Bush authored both Sixth Circuit majority opinions. See Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 339–41 (6th Cir. 2022); Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th 983, 990 (6th Cir. 2022); Missouri v. Yellen, 39 F.4th 1063, 1069 (8th Cir. 2022). The Eighth Circuit held that Missouri’s alleged Spending Contract injury was not imminent enough for standing. 212 Missouri v. Yellen, 39 F.4th at 1069 n.5, 1070. Missouri’s alleged injury was to its “constitutional right to clarity regarding the conditions of congressional appropriations.” Id. at 1069 n.5. Even though the court does not describe it as a sovereign injury, it compares its decision to the Ninth Circuit’s in Arizona v. Yellen . Id. The Sixth Circuit did address Ohio’s “supposed ambiguity-as-injury” argument that articulated a Spending Contract theory. 213 Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th at 988. But, the court held that because Ohio had accepted the CSLFRF since filing suit, the “cloud of uncertainty about the Offset Provision’s meaning” no longer injured it, rendering the case moot. 214 Id. at 990.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit in Kentucky v. Yellen rejected the states’ argument that receipt of an ambiguous or coercive offer “ in the past ” was sufficient to create present standing without proof of present or future harm. 215 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 338–39 (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983)). Even in finding the Offset Provision too ambiguous on the merits, Judge Bush clarified that the Pennhurst and Arlington clear-statement rule was a tool of statutory interpretation, not a means to void federal legislation outright. 216 See id. at 347–48.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Judge Bush’s opinion in Kentucky v. Yellen stands in stark contrast to the majority of circuits that have considered the issue, not only on the Spending Contract injury standing questions but also on the underlying merits of ambiguity in the Spending Clause. Both conceptions understand that the Pennhurst prohibition on ambiguity arises from a desire to protect state autonomy through the Spending Clause’s quasi-contractual nature. 217 See Nicole Huberfeld, Elizabeth Weeks Leonard & Kevin Outterson, Plunging into Endless Difficulties: Medicaid and Coercion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 93 B.U. L. Rev. 1, 52 (2013) (“The connections between conditional spending power, clear notice, and federalism are direct. State autonomy is preserved by ensuring that states knowingly and voluntarily enter into cooperative arrangements with the federal government.”). Judge Bush’s conception of the injury, however, does not dispense with standing’s requirements to achieve that goal. As discussed, the different approaches could follow the different conceptions of the merits. 218 See Fallon, supra note 108, at 1095–96.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The circuits also had disparate interpretations of the Tax Power injury. The Tax Power injury describes the federal curtailing of a state’s ability to exercise its sovereign tax powers, whether because of ambiguity, coercion, or undue federal limitations. Whereas the Spending Contract injury relates to the state’s sovereign rights to an uncoerced and unambiguous offer, the Tax Power injury speaks more to the substance of that contract. State plaintiffs, the theory suggests, have a cognizable injury where a spending condition “casts a pall over” the “exercise [of their] sovereign tax power.” 219 Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th at 990. The Tax Power injury grants standing where federal legislation “unconstitutionally intrud[es] on [a state’s] sovereign authority,” 220 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 360 (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). and threatens the state’s “sovereign prerogative to ‘tax its residents as it sees fit.’ ” 221 Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 851 (9th Cir. 2022).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Across the circuits, the states and courts articulated the injury somewhat similarly, each bemoaning federal limitations on a core sovereign power: taxation. 222 See id. ; Missouri v. Yellen, 39 F.4th 1063, 1068 (8th Cir. 2022) (reiterating Missouri’s description of its injury as an intrusion on “their sovereign taxing authority” and “orderly management of their fiscal affairs [and] interfering with state legislative functions”); Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 332 (describing Kentucky’s and Tennessee’s injuries as Missouri did); Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th at 989 (recounting Ohio’s argument that the Offset Provision “cast[s] a pall over legislators’ abilities to contemplate such tax changes”) (quoting Ohio v. Yellen, 574 F. Supp. 3d 713, 725 (S.D. Ohio 2021)); West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1136 (11th Cir. 2023) (describing the injury as a “a present and continuous infringement on state sovereignty”). The Fifth Circuit did not explicitly discuss the Tax Power injury. Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 764 (5th Cir. 2024). Despite this commonality, the courts differed greatly in actually recognizing the injury when analyzing standing, with no court finding state standing for the Tax Power injury alone. 223 See Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 851–53 (mentioning the Tax Power injury but finding only Spending Contract standing); Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 340–42 (denying standing for the Tax Power injury before finding compliance cost standing); Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1136–37 (alluding to the effect on state taxing authority but finding only Spending Contract standing); Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th at 764 (noting the loss of taxing authority as part of Spending Contract injury). The Ninth Circuit specifically noted the Tax Power injury as a distinct theory of state injury but then only analyzed the Spending Contract theory. 224 See Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 851–53. And in both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, the Tax Power injury was still treated as “heighten[ing the Offset Provision’s] effect on state sovereignty.” 225 Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1136 (citing McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 428 (1819)); Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 853 (arguing that the Spending Contract injury would cause Arizona to “face serious consequences in losing control over its taxing policies”). Curtailing the power to tax was a vaguely articulated plus factor for standing.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The haziness of the courts’ analysis complexifies what sovereign injury was really contributing to standing: Was the state injured because of the “sovereign” nature of the contract’s subject matter, or was ambiguity in the federal offer sufficient? Given each court’s reference to Massachusetts v. EPA , the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits appeared to accord the Offset Provision’s curtailment of a sovereign power with special solicitude’s “extra-credit.” 226 Crocker, supra note 128, at 831; see also Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th at 851; Morrisey , 59 F.4th at 1136. This formulation of special solicitude, one that grants an unquantifiable amount of standing oomph, likely stems from the circuits’ “preexisting normative commitments”—the regulation of a sacrosanct sovereign power like taxation just has to get a state plaintiff over the standing threshold and into federal court. 227 See Fallon, supra note 108, at 1098 (discussing Dan M. Kahan, The Supreme Court, 2010 Term—Foreword: Neutral Principles, Motivated Cognition, and Some Problems for Constitutional Law , 125 Harv. L. Rev. , 1, 19–20 (2011)). For the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, special solicitude is not a new injury but a generalized invitation.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Only one opinion across the Offset Provision cases would have found Tax Power standing as a distinct injury. Writing separately in Kentucky v. Yellen , Judge Nalbandian articulated the Tax Power injury’s broadest conception: His formulation was entirely distinct from the Spending Contract theory and peerlessly offered Massachusetts v. EPA to support its analysis. 228 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 360–62 (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Judge Nalbandian argued that special solicitude granted liberal injury and standing requirements for state plaintiffs. 229 Id. at 359. And he suggested that, per Massachusetts v. EPA , states are subject to a reduced imminence standard for standing and that “as federal regulation has increased over the states, the list of sovereign injuries has grown.” 230 Id. at 359; see id. (“And we give ‘special’ recognition to a case when a state sues the federal government.” (quoting Saginaw County v. STAT Emergency Med. Servs., Inc., 946 F.3d 951, 957 (6th Cir. 2020))). Applying this elastic injury and imminence standard to the present case, Judge Nalbandian insisted that the Offset Provision created ongoing Tax Power standing. 231 Id. at 360–62. Because the law “intruded” into a traditional state function and “chill[ed] the States from enacting” tax cuts, states risked damaging their economies—arguably a core sovereign concern. 232 Id. at 359–61 (quoting Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 599 (6th Cir. 2022)). As in Massachusetts v. EPA , this injury could also be framed as a quasi-sovereign (state on behalf of its citizens) or a proprietary (state’s bottom line) injury. 549 U.S. 497, 518–20 (2007). Even if the final rule did moot the risk of recoupment, 233 Judge Nalbandian did not think that the final rule credibly disavowed recoupment. Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 362–63 (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Judge Nalbandian argued that the Rule “narrow[s]” state regulatory flexibility, “which in turn takes a toll on the States’ citizens and economies.” 234 Id. at 363–64 (“[I]f the States wish to comply with the Rules, they must do something —either raise other taxes or lower expenditures elsewhere in the budget to offset a revenue reduction. That something creates an ongoing injury.”). To Judge Nalbandian, regardless of imminence or actual risk, states are continuously injured if they cannot do something sovereign , like tax.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Like the no-imminence-required approach to the Spending Contract injury, Judge Nalbandian’s articulation of the Tax Power injury coincides with Bulman-Pozen’s justification for special solicitude. 238 See supra Section I.B.1. For Bulman-Pozen, states have a role in “vindicating the public interest” to the same extent as federal lawmakers. 239 Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1750. The haphazard piling of Judge Nalbandian’s inferences aside, a state’s economic health would likely fall under this public interest umbrella. Although both arrive at the same legal conclusion—state standing—Bulman-Pozen does not equate special solicitude with the protection of the state-plaintiff’s “residuary and inviolable sovereignty” as Judge Nalbandian does. 240 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 359 (6th Cir. 2022) (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part) (quoting The Federalist No. 39 , at 245 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961)). Instead, Bulman-Pozen argues, consistent with the new process federalism perspective on state servants in a federal regulatory system, Massachusetts v. EPA suggests the loss of state sovereignty: The “lodging” of the state’s sovereign prerogatives into the federal government “gave the state a cognizable interest in ensuring the EPA’s compliance with federal law.” 241 Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1747. Nonetheless, as Bulman-Pozen and Judge Nalbandian conceive it, federal courts—not Congress—are the appropriate forums to hash out policy differences and sovereign interests. 242 See id. at 1748. Little legal scholarship exists offering a defense of special solicitude from Judge Nalbandian’s perspective—that states have a sovereign interest that should be protected from federal overreach. Scholars seem to divide into two, relatively non-ideological camps: (i) end special solicitude and (ii) new process federalist special solicitude.

,,,,"The Sixth Circuit majority (from which Judge Nalbandian dissented on this issue) otherwise had a more constrained view of the Tax Power injury. 243 Judge Bush did appear to incorporate Judge Nalbandian’s analysis in his statement denying rehearing en banc in Kentucky . See Kentucky v. Yellen, 67 F.4th 322, 323 (mem.) (6th Cir. 2023) (denying rehearing en banc ) (calling the Offset Provision a “violent assumption of power”) (quoting The Federalist No. 32 , at 154 (Alexander Hamilton) (George W. Carey & James McClellan eds., 2001)). The court explained that before the Treasury’s final rule, the Offset Provision’s constraint of Kentucky and Tennessee’s “sovereign authority to tax . . . sufficed for standing.” 244 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th at 336. However, after the final rule, the states no longer had Tax Power standing because they failed to identify a “specific course of conduct” that would lead to recoupment. 245 Id. at 338–39. The court reasoned that the final rule “subsequently disavowed the States’ interpretation of the Offset Provision,” leaving them with an outdated fear of losing the CSLFRF. 246 Id. at 339. The court reached a similar conclusion in Ohio v. Yellen : Ohio suffered no injury from the mere “subjective chill” the Offset Provision had on its taxing authority. 247 Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F. 4th 983, 990–91 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972)). Likewise, the Eighth Circuit held that where there was no imminent threat to Missouri’s “constitutional right to set taxes,” there was no Tax Power injury. 248 Missouri v.

Id. at 767. Instead, the court discussed the “surrendering [of the plaintiffs’] ability to set state tax policy” as part of the Spending Contract injury—the power to tax is simply part of the consideration in a coercive contractual offer. 250 See id. at 764. It is entirely possible that the court would treat its analysis of ambiguity and coercion in the Offset Provision differently if the state were foregoing something pedestrian (and not sovereign) like contractual rights with a private party, but there is no specific discussion of how the sovereign nature of the tax power elevates plaintiffs’ standing.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Federal courts should be available to serve as “mediators” when states face actual coercion to ensure a healthy federalism. 258 Wright & Miller , supra note 90, § 3531.11.1. The best way to achieve this balance of federalism and the separation of powers is to look to Spending Clause jurisprudence. In cases like Dole and Sebelius , there was no question that states had standing to sue given the legislation’s immediate obligations. 259 See supra Section I.C. There, the federal offers required legislation from the states—you don’t get this money unless you raise the legal drinking age. 260 South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 205 (1987).

Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 581–82 (2012); Bagenstos, supra note 83, at 870. In such cases that require near-immediate action for money, states would not be able to complete the required act if Congress’s expectations were ambiguous, or they would be unfairly forced to act if the bargaining was coercive or ambiguous.

,,,,"The Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits overstepped this circumscribed role. In those circuits, the courts’ standing analyses went off track in part because they misapplied the substantive Spending Clause precedent. The Fifth and Eleventh Circuits did not treat Pennhurst ’s clear-statement rule as a rule of statutory construction to protect the states from unexpected duties and suits. 265 See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (explaining that under Pennhurst , courts interpreting spending statutes must ask whether conditions on spending are such that a state official deciding whether to accept funds would clearly understand the obligations that accompany them). Instead, as the Eleventh Circuit explained, they believed the Pennhurst requirement incorporated in the Dole rule “is a binding constitutional command.” 266 West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1142 (11th Cir. 2023) (citing Benning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 2004)). Following the “search and destroy” theme, the Fifth Circuit further argued that the Constitution imposes an affirmative “bar on ambiguous spending conditions and provid[es] grounds for an injunction against the enforcement of such conditions.” 267 Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 771 (5th Cir. 2024). Ignoring the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education , which provides that Congress is not required to “prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular applications” of its spending conditions, 268 Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985). the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits effectively eliminated any interpretive wiggle room. Forget about standing: States would win every Spending Clause ambiguity challenge under that conception of the Pennhurst rule.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"No Article I power—let alone spending—demands linguistic perfection. Pennhurst does not provide this sort of substantive attack on ambiguity; it and Arlington applied a clear-statement rule of statutory construction that ensures states have fair notice of their duties and obligations after accepting federal funds. 269 See Pasachoff, supra note 201, at 589. The rule does not create any substantive limit on federal power, 270 Id. so it should not give states a nebulous, ambiguity-challenging cause of action.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"States should have standing for coercive and ambiguous federal offers under the Spending Clause, but those offers must present an imminent affront to state sovereignty. Federal courts can, as they did in Sebelius , step in when Congress’s offer is a “gun to the head” of the states that would immediately change state policy on an issue. 271 Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 581 (2012). But for mere discretionary spending conditions like the Offset Provision, particularly one designed to ensure maintenance-of-effort, 272 See Clarke & Fox, supra note 45, at 1362. states should not have standing without imminent federal enforcement.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Several of the Offset Provision opinions crafted an expansive Tax Power injury even if none attributed standing to that injury alone. 273 See supra Section I.B. Judge Nalbandian’s conception in Kentucky v. Yellen , that states have standing whenever legislation subjectively “intrude[s]” or “chill[s]” a state’s sovereign authority to make laws (or broader yet, has “negative effects” on a state’s economy), 274 Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 360–61 (6th Cir. 2022) (Nalbandian, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). would grant near-absolute state standing to challenge federal spending. As Judge Bush explains in the majority opinion, “ any law could be said to ‘limit the range,’ in an abstract sense, of a plaintiff’s legitimate behavior.” 275 Id. at 339 n.8 (majority opinion). Federal legislation “cast[ing] a pall over legislators’ abilities to contemplate” lawmaking is far too subjective and abstract an injury for standing. 276 Ohio v. Yellen, 53 F.4th 983, 989–91 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Ohio v. Yellen, 547 F. Supp. 3d 713, 725 (S.D. Ohio 2021), rev’d and vacated , 53 F.4th 983 (6th Cir. 2022)). States could always suggest that anything other than no limitations on federal funds would step on their sovereign toes.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Furthermore, states should not have standing based on the subject matter of the federal regulation alone. Both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits appear to treat the subject matter of the Offset Provision, which implicates a state’s ability to create and cut taxes, as a plus factor in finding standing. 277 See supra Section I.B. Although the Fifth Circuit did not discuss the Tax Power injury directly, its reasoning on the merits is also troubling on this front, as anytime Congress “require[s] the States to accept policy changes, [it] triggers the [Spending Clause’s] coercion analysis.” 278 Texas v. Yellen, 105 F.4th 755, 768 (5th Cir. 2024). This rule is unworkable for standing: Standing should not be based on whether the spending condition at issue touches something “too sovereign-y” because that standard provides judges too much unfettered discretion.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Instead, the Tax Power injury—or, better named, the Regulatory Power injury, as it would not be subject-matter specific—should apply a similar distinction as outlined in the previous Section. If a federal spending program restrains a state’s ability to regulate —a state may not pass any tax cuts for two years, a state’s drinking age must be twenty-one, etc.—states should have standing. The state can no longer make law where it once could, regardless of the subject matter of that law. The constraint on this uniquely sovereign ability—to make laws for its own citizens—should be a justiciable injury-in-fact. The injury would also be distinct from the Spending Contract injury, as there would be nothing ambiguous or coercive about the federal offer ; states would be challenging the substance of the deal. 279 States would still likely plead multiple theories of injury, including the Spending Contract theory. See supra Section I.B; South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210–12 (1987) (analyzing both the alleged coercive effect of the federal offer and the alleged problems with the regulatory substance of the drinking age).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For spending rules like the Offset Provision, states could still have Regulatory Power standing. However, the federal constraint of the state’s power to regulate as it wants to must be concrete. States should not have standing merely because federal legislation subjectively chills their power, especially when federal regulators are not imminently constraining that power. But if the restriction is concrete, as in actual or imminent (not “ ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’ ”), 280 Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990). then states should have standing to prevent the “loss” of their lawmaking function.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bulman-Pozen’s support of special solicitude does not actually offer a solution to special solicitude’s biggest hurdle: How does it work? 290 Bulman-Pozen acknowledges that “[e]ven the basic question of what warrants special solicitude remains unclear.” Bulman-Pozen, supra note 26, at 1745. The Offset Provision cases and other circuit courts’ attempts to apply Massachusetts v. EPA have elucidated no doctrinal framework for applying special solicitude. 291 See Crocker, supra note 128. While there may be normative benefits to federal-state bargaining in implementing regulatory policy, those benefits will arguably exist in every case. The core separation-of-powers principles at the heart of standing doctrine counsel against allowing every state suit into federal court simply for the sake of crafting a better deal. 292 See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Determining state standing for sovereign injuries should not be an open-ended affair. Curtailing special solicitude’s future use will help simplify lower federal courts’ standing analyses for continuing state challenges to federal policy. 296 Woolhandler & Mahoney, supra note 147, at 35. State plaintiffs should not get a free pass to contest federal policy merely by virtue of their sovereign status. And if they somehow do, it should at least be on a more concrete doctrinal basis, rather than “extra-credit” and judicial spitballing. 297 See Crocker, supra note 128, at 831.",,0,html_body_unmatched
