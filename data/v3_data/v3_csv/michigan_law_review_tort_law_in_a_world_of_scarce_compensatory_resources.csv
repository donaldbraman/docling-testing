4,"Wealth would seem to be substantively irrelevant given the rule that excludes evidence concerning the defendant's financial resources when determining breach or compensatory damages. The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor's prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law-why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

8,"First, money is a poor substitute for bodily injury-there is not enough money to compensate for a lost life, and money does not perfectly replace broken bones or fully correct for the fundamental alteration of one's life. Recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented ex ante instead of being compensated ex post with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy.

13,B. Policy and Principle Within the Normative Calculus of Tort Law,section_header,body_text,"Though allocatively inefficient, a tort obligation to compensate these kinds of injuries does not violate a welfarist rationale for tort liability. These compensatory transfers find justification in Pareto optimality, a normative cornerstone of welfare economics that formulates liability rules so that the risky behavior makes no one worse off. 185 In the same way that deterrence can justifiably shape tort law even if tort liability does not optimally deter, the ideal of full compensation embodied in the Pareto principle can justifiably shape tort law under second-best conditions of imperfect injury compensation. See generally Mark A. Geistfeld, Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts: Carrying Calabresi Further , J.L. & Contemp. Probs. , no. 2, 2014, at 165 (showing how a compensatory norm generates tort rules that adequately satisfy the demands of the Pareto principle for social interactions constrained by transaction costs). As for the central normative importance of the Pareto principle for welfarist interpretations of tort law, see Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Fairness Versus Welfare 54–56, 54 n.76 (2002) for an argument that any nonwelfarist rationale for tort law violates the Pareto principle and should be rejected for that reason. A purely compensatory rule reorients the welfarist inquiry from allocative efficiency, or cost minimization, to Pareto optimality. The reasons for doing so are internal to the logic of welfarism. 186 The requisite logic is inherent within cost-benefit analysis. For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A.

Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder’s willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes. A compensatory rule, such as strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities, accordingly satisfies the basic requirements of both fairness and welfarist rationales within the normative calculus of tort law, albeit in a more normatively complex manner than conventional economic theories depict by exclusively focusing on cost minimization and allocative efficiency.",,78.46153846153847,matched

An obvious rejoinder is that the criminal law provides the requisite protection. This response is not fully persuasive, however. Individuals often fatally injure someone else without engaging in criminal misconduct, as frequently occurs in motor-vehicle crashes. 103 Criminal liability does not attach to all accidents causing premature death, and in these cases, tort law does not compensate decedents for their loss of life's pleasures.

However, if tort law otherwise adequately accounts for these harms outside the damages remedy, then it could fairly protect individuals from the threat of premature death even in the absence of both criminal and tort liability. Put somewhat differently, although wrongful-death damages are neither fair nor full for the decedent right-holder, the tort right might nevertheless be constructed to fairly protect right-holders from bodily injury, including premature death. In that event, imperfect injury compensation via the damages remedy for wrongful death would influence the negligence rule's substantive formulation.

The Problem of Insolvency,section_header,body_text,"This considerable expansion of liability explains why courts have historically invoked the concern “about opening the proverbial floodgates of litigation” to limit negligence liability. 228 Robert L. Rabin, Emotional Distress in Tort Law: Themes of Constraint , 44 Wake Forest L. Rev. 1197, 1198 (2009). At the turn of the twentieth century, individuals who were rendered insolvent by tort judgments still faced jailtime because of the debt. 229 See supra notes 114–115 and accompanying text. Forms of tort liability that regularly threatened insolvency, therefore, implicated the ordinary duty-bearer’s interest in avoiding prison. An accident victim’s interest in economic security or emotional tranquility, though important and worthy of legal protection in the appropriate cases, could not justify sending someone to prison for their inability to pay off these tort debts. Such a severe deprivation of a negligent injurer’s liberty is normatively more burdensome than the accident victim’s financial loss or emotional distress. The problem of insolvency and the looming threat of debtor’s prison explain why courts of this era barred claims for pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional distress on the ground that duty-bearers would otherwise “face liabilities that are indeterminate and out of proportion to their culpability.” 230 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Econ. Harm § 1 cmt. c ( A.L.I. 2020) (discussing economic loss); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 436A cmt. b ( A.L.I. 1965) (identifying three reasons why courts limit negligence liability for stand-alone emotional harms, one of which is that “is that where the defendant has been merely negligent, without any element of intent to do harm, his fault is not so great that he should be required to make good a purely mental disturbance”).",,96.42857142857143,matched

See infra Section IV.C. But in the absence of such reprehensible behavior, tort law does not award punitive damages.

For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder’s total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrence-based liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care.

This compensatory rule of strict liability, therefore, applies to the same kinds of social interactions as it did in the state of nature. The primary difference is that modern social interactions hardly ever involve these kinds of objectively defined nonreciprocal risks; they are “abnormally dangerous activities.” 184 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Physical & Emotional Harm § 20 ( A.L.I . 2010).",,70.3125,matched

An accident victim's interest in economic security or emotional tranquility, though important and worthy of legal protection in the appropriate cases, could not justify sending someone to prison for their inability to pay off these tort debts. Such a severe deprivation of a negligent injurer's liberty is normatively more burdensome than the accident victim's financial loss or emotional distress. The problem of insolvency and the looming threat of debtor's prison explain why courts of this era barred claims for pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional distress on the ground that duty-bearers would otherwise 'face liabilities that are indeterminate and out of proportion to their culpability.' 230",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

For example, courts permit recovery for pure economic losses if there is “some special relation between the parties” such as “a telegraph company’s negligent transmission of a message,” the “negligent failure to perform a gratuitous promise to obtain insurance, and the negligent delay in acting upon an application for insurance.” 257 Union Oil Co. v. Oppen, 501 F.2d 558, 565 (9th Cir. 1974) (citation and internal quotes omitted). The negligent misconduct in these cases does not threaten any foreseeable physical harm, eliminating the need to limit the duty so that the “worst go first.” Courts have also departed from the physical-harm requirement to award damages for the reasonable medical costs of monitoring for future bodily injuries, such as cancer. Like the ordinary duty governing physical harms, the substantive duty encompassing the financial costs of medical monitoring is grounded in the equitable concern to prevent these irreparable bodily injuries from happening. 258 See generally Geistfeld, supra note 221 (arguing that the equitable maxim of the “worst goes first” does not defensibly limit the medical-monitoring cause of action).",,89.74358974358975,matched

The first involves financial harms that arise within contractual settings, such as the cost a consumer incurs to repair a defective product. Subject to certain exceptions, the contractually based economic loss rule bars tort recovery for these injuries. 249 These tort rules are justified by the need to maintain the integrity of the tort-contract boundary; they turn on the ability of right-holders to adequately protect their interests by contracting and are not relevant for our purposes. 250 The second type of pure economic loss occurs outside of contractual settings. As is true for the contractually based economic-loss rule, this one also bars recovery for pure economic losses subject to certain exceptions.

Bankr.

This is because tort claims are general unsecured claims, which are subordinate to secured claims under state law and the United States Bankruptcy Code.”). This compensatory problem is brought into sharp relief by the Supreme Court’s recent decision involving Purdue Pharma L.P.’s bankruptcy after it faced at least $40 trillion of potential tort liabilities for manufacturing and distributing Oxycontin, the highly addictive pain killer largely responsible for triggering the opioid-overdose crisis. 2 Harrington v.

To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a “social currency” that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injury-causing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations.

The plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages only if the injury is to a legally protected interest with a relative priority over the defendant’s conflicting, legally protected interest. The balancing of interests can also work in the other direction, with the defendant’s interest receiving a relative priority over the plaintiff’s conflicting interest, in which case the plaintiff’s injury to the legally protected, subordinate interest “does not suffice to collect damages.” 22 Id.

This type of balancing would require courts to determine the relative importance of the conflicting security and liberty interests for individuals to lead a life of their own choosing. Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare. Exactly how a tort rule balances one conflicting interest over another within the normative calculus of tort law depends on the highly contestable requirement of substantive equality and its implications for the nature of tort liability. 25 Different theories of justice disagree about “which specific kind of equality is required by the more abstract idea of treating people as equals.” Will Kymlicka , Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction 4 ( 2d ed. 2001).

The institutional requirement to treat “like cases alike” then provides the mechanism that, in principle, enables courts to coherently develop tort law over time and across cases based on these incompletely theorized agreements. 30 For more extensive analysis, see Mark A.

A defendant’s financial ability to pay for the tort judgment does not justify tort liability. 34 See supra note 8 and accompanying text. Instead, a defendant’s wealth, along with the opportunity to insure against tort liability, is relevant for attaining the efficient and fair distribution of resources across society. 35 Differences in individual wealth obviously matter for social schemes of redistributing wealth across society. Liability insurance is relevant to the socially efficient allocation of resources. See Tom Baker & Peter Siegelman, The Law and Economics of Liability Insurance: A Theoretical and Empirical Review , in Research Handbook on the Economics of Torts 169, 174 (Jennifer H.

How, then, could the availability of compensatory resources be a normatively relevant factor for determining the duty a defendant in principle owed to the plaintiff right-holder? The apparently obvious negative answer to this question may explain why scholars so far have assumed that liability insurance—and by extension, the availability of compensatory resources—can factor into substantive tort law only as a matter of policy, not principle. 36 See, e.g. , Abraham & Sharkey, supra note 6, at 2243; Weinrib, supra note 9, at 684 (“Deploying insurance considerations to resolve tort disputes . . . entails an instrumentalist and legislative conception of law.”); see also Zhong Xing Tan, The Enigma of Interpersonal Justice in Private Law Theory , 43 Oxford J.

The looming prospect of debtor’s prison factors into the normative calculus of tort law and explains why the characteristic tort rule before the twentieth century was one of “no liability” rather than negligence liability. 123 Robert L. Rabin, The Historical Development of the Fault Principle: A Reinterpretation , 15 Ga. L. Rev. 925 (1981) (arguing that the dominant rule in the 19th century was one of no liability or an immunity from liability or a privilege of conduct that would otherwise be a tortious form of negligence liability).

Schwartz, Tort Law and the Economy in Nineteenth-Century America: A Reinterpretation , 90 Yale L.J. 1717, 1717 (1981). The associated claim that courts limited liability to “subsidize” the newly industrializing economy is hard to square with available evidence. 125 See id. The foregoing analysis provides additional historical reasons for rejecting the subsidy thesis. By limiting liability to avoid depressing economic development, courts could defensibly rely on the associated concern of ensuring that individuals would have the financial ability to maintain their physical health. The lack of social wealth in this era largely eliminated the normative difference between one’s security interest and another’s conflicting liberty interest chiefly concerned about survival. This reason of principle justified extensive rules of “no liability.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

Life expectancy at birth significantly improves with a “sharp increase” in GDP per capita, underscoring the relation between survival and wealth. 126 Richard A. Easterlin, The Worldwide Standard of Living Since 1800 , J. Econ. Persps. , Winter 2000, at 7, 12. Throughout the twentieth century, social wealth accumulated. From 1900 to 1950, the GDP per capita in the United States increased from $4,096 to $9,573 measured in constant 1990 international dollars; by 1992 it had further increased to $21,558 (approximately $52,817 in current dollars). 127 Maddison , supra note 118, 23 tbl. 1-3 (OECD Development Centre 1995). Consumption patterns changed accordingly. “By comparison with the conveniences and comforts widely available in developed economies at the end of the 20th century, everyday life two centuries ago was most akin to what we know today as ‘camping out.’ ” 128 Easterlin, supra note 126, at 11. With the financial capacity to improve living conditions beyond the bare necessities, individuals had discretionary income to acquire other kinds of goods and services characteristic of modern life’s conveniences and comforts. The increased social wealth made it possible for tort law to normatively distinguish between one’s physical security and another’s conflicting liberty interest involving the expenditure of financial resources.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The defendant’s bad-faith rejection of the primary obligation to exercise reasonable care, even when coupled with the payment of compensatory damages for the breach, is reprehensible only because the compensatory damages remedy does not adequately protect the tort right in cases of irreparable injury. This inherent limitation of the compensatory damages remedy stems from the scarcity of compensatory resources and creates a retributive rationale for punitive damages—a property consistent with our earlier finding that perfectly compensatory damages obviate the need to punish injury-causing conduct. 154 See supra Section II.B.",,0,html_body_unmatched

After all, if money were sufficient for retributive purposes, wealthy individuals could intentionally kill or sexually attack others and buy their way out of responsibility by paying monetary damages. These kinds of retributive problems create a complementary role for criminal liability, explaining why “punitive or exemplary damages have been assessed . . . upon evidence of such [willfulness], recklessness or wickedness, on the part of the party at fault, as amounted to criminality.’ ” 155 Lake Shore & Mich.

To do so, tort law must prioritize the right-holder’s interest in physical security (the protected object) over the duty-bearer’s compensatory obligation and the associated burden on liberty. By justifying a relative interpersonal priority of the individual interest in physical security, the problem of scarce compensatory resources also creates two distinctive rationales for strict liability.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Strict liability sidesteps this evidentiary problem. As Oliver Wendell Holmes explained, in these cases “the safest way to secure care is to throw the risk upon the person who decides what precautions shall be taken.” 159 Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 117 (Boston, Little, Brown & Co. 1881). Rather than have the court make the safety decision based on the evidence a plaintiff presents, strict liability “throws” that decision on duty-bearers. To minimize their total cost of acting safely and compensating residual harms, strictly liable actors will take any precaution that reduces their liability (injury costs) in a cost-effective manner. If these risky actors would forego any of these precautions in a negligence regime because of proof problems, the shift to strict liability would increase safety measures and reduce the incidence of irreparable injury. 160 See Steven Shavell, Strict Liability Versus Negligence , 9 J. Legal Stud . 1, 22 & n.28 (1980) (showing how strict liability can reduce risk by reducing “activity” levels, where “activity” is any aspect of risky behavior that is outside the ambit of negligence liability due to evidentiary limitations).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Courts in the nineteenth century recognized this evidentiary rationale for strict liability. 161 See Pollock , supra note 98, at 393. In the early twentieth century, this deterrence reasoning helped justify workers’ compensation statutes that displace negligence liability with a regime subjecting employers to no-fault or strict liability for work-related injuries. 162 See N.Y. Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188, 197 (1917). Courts subsequently relied on this evidentiary rationale to justify strict products liability. 163 See, e.g. , Cushing v. Rodman, 82 F.2d 864, 869 (D.C. Cir. 1936) (imposing liability without proof of fault in a defective food case by stating that “[r]estricting recovery by the injured member of the public to cases predicated upon negligence is a seriously inadequate means of securing the social interest in the individual safety, because of the great difficulty of proof for the plaintiff”).",,0,html_body_unmatched

Like that baseline negligence rule, these strict liability rules are formulated to equitably prevent irreparable injuries like premature death.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Consider the customary practices in the state of nature that first defined the common law. In this era, injury victims had the remedial alternatives of pursuing punishment—“an eye for an eye”—or receiving compensation—“the value of an eye for an eye.” As we have found, these two remedies are complementary responses to the scarcity of compensatory resources and the resultant problem of imperfect injury compensation. 164 See supra Section III.A. The early common law then improved upon this remedial scheme by having the state exact punishment through the criminal law, enabling victims to pursue tort claims for compensation. 165 This is the basic thesis of the self-help model of legal development. See Geistfeld, supra note 79, at 1523–25. Despite this important legal development, the normative fact remained that the victim suffered grievous injury and deserved compensation embodied in the entitlement of the “value of an eye for an eye.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

Similarly, if while pursuing my ends I instead hurt you, I should still incur the injury costs as a matter of reciprocity or fairness: I should, in other words, pay you “the value of an eye for an eye.” Such a reciprocity norm straightforwardly explains why there was “a deep sense of early common law morality that one who hurts another should compensate him.” 166 Leon Green, Foreseeability in Negligence Law , 61 Colum. L. Rev. 1401, 1412 (1961); see also Francis H. Bohlen, The Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher: Part I , 59 U. Pa. L.

The threat of punitive damages for culpable forms of unreasonably dangerous behaviors would enforce the baseline duty to exercise reasonable care, while the strict liability rule provides compensation for the residual harms. Why, then, does modern tort law only employ strict liability in highly circumscribed circumstances?",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,In what respect is it equitable or fair to require someone else to compensate your injury when you are the one paying for that compensation?

Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 810 P.2d 549, 552 (Cal. 1991) (en banc). Strict products liability instead fairly protects consumer right-holders by obligating commercial sellers to provide reasonably safe, non-defective products, with the compensatory damages remedy enforcing that obligation. Strict products liability, in other words, is justified by deterrence reasoning and not by the fairness of compensation.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For these same reasons, a purely compensatory rule of strict liability can also be excessively costly for right-holders outside contractual settings. A wide range of risky behaviors contribute to the background level of reasonable risk in a community. For example, reasonably safe driving can still cause a crash. This familiar form of risky behavior is part of the background level of reasonable risk a community tolerates. The duty governing these kinds of common, risky social interactions burdens the ordinary person while creating risks (such as by driving); it also protects them from the risky behavior of others (like passing drivers on the roadway). For the category of risky interactions comprising the background level of reasonable risk in the community, the ordinary right-holder is also a reciprocally situated duty-bearer who incurs the full burden of the duty. This distributive outcome—like in contractual settings—eliminates a compensatory rationale for strict liability. 176 For more rigorous demonstration, see Geistfeld, supra note 79, at 1564–82.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The injurious interactions in the state of nature were limited to cases in which the member of one family, clan, or tribe harmed someone from another. These social interactions were neither contractual nor reciprocally situated within a community’s background level of reasonable risk—there was not one political community in the state of nature but many independent clans and the like. An injury-causing interaction between two clans was inherently nonreciprocal, justifying a compensatory rule of strict liability—the “value of an eye for an eye”—to attain equitable balance in cases of accidental injury. 182 Id. at 344-45 (citing Miller , supra note 55, at 24-26 (2006)).",,0,html_body_unmatched

A purely compensatory tort rule, by definition, is wholly justified in terms of fair or reasonable injury compensation and not by injury deterrence (unlike negligence and related rules of strict liability formulated to overcome the evidentiary hurdles of proving negligence liability). A purely compensatory tort rule is allocatively inefficient: The compensatory transfer merely shifts the injury costs from one party to the other while creating the associated transaction costs. In the absence of deterrence, social costs are minimized by letting the loss fall on the injured accident victim.

,,,,"Though irrelevant for proving negligent misconduct or the amount of compensable harm, the availability of liability insurance is relevant to the antecedent element of duty. Unlike the case-specific inquiries concerning unreasonable behavior and compensatory damages, the element of duty entails a categorical inquiry that accounts for the burden the tort obligation would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the cases the duty governs. 190 See supra Section II.B. The nature of this inquiry provides a principled basis for making the availability of liability insurance relevant to the tort duty—the only aspect of the tort claim for which courts expressly rely on liability insurance to formulate substantive tort doctrine. 191 See Abraham & Sharkey, supra note 6, at 2187–88, 2207–14.",,0,html_body_unmatched

As the economic sociologist Viviana Zelizer has found in her studies about money’s contemporary social meaning, “Of course, quantity makes a difference; people care about how much money is involved in their transactions. But what kind of money it is and whose money also matter greatly.” 197 Zelizer , supra note 49, at 200. Consistent with these findings, Tom Baker interviewed personal-injury lawyers in Connecticut and found that they often distinguish “insurance money” from “blood money” that defendants pay “out of their own pockets. As their term reflects, blood money hurts defendants in a way that money paid on behalf of a defendant by a liability insurance company cannot.” 198 Tom Baker, Blood Money, New Money, and the Moral Economy of Tort Law in Action , 35 L. & Soc’y Rev. 275, 276 (2001).",,0,html_body_unmatched

Goldberg & Benjamin C. Zipursky, Recognizing Wrongs 266 (2020). In their view, the purely compensatory rule of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities does not involve any such mistreatment, making this form of liability “so distinctive as to locate it at or beyond tort law’s conceptual boundaries.” 200 Id. at 191.

Rather than paying substantial money out of pocket, individual tortfeasors can file for bankruptcy. 203 See generally Gilles, supra note 129 (discussing the varied ways in which bankruptcy protection effectively enables tortfeasors to avoid liability). The Supreme Court recently ended the practice of extending such protection to third parties who have not declared bankruptcy. 204 Harrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2088 (2024). This decision, which overturned a bankruptcy plan immunizing the Sackler family from any further opioid-related personal liabilities, was lauded by the attorney general of Connecticut: “The U.S. Supreme Court got it right—billionaire wrongdoers should not be allowed to shield blood money in bankruptcy court.” 205 Jan Hoffman, Purdue Opioid Settlement on Verge of Collapse After Supreme Court Ruling , N.Y.

,,,,"Of course, billionaire wrongdoers can also seek bankruptcy protection, but their abundant personal financial assets will still be largely depleted to compensate their tort victims. Blood money is available in exceptional cases like these and partially offsets the diminished retributive role of punitive damages. After all, a tortfeasor who is unable to pay off outstanding compensatory liabilities suffers no punishment by incurring the further (judgment-proof) extra compensatory liabilities of punitive damages. The only meaningful source of tort retribution resides in the blood-money-funded liabilities of the bankrupt tortfeasor’s personal assets.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In the ordinary case, however, individual defendants can avoid satisfying their tort obligations by shielding most of their assets through bankruptcy. 206 See Gilles, supra note 129, at 606 (“In the absence of liability insurance, plaintiffs are effectively barred from bringing suit unless the tortfeasor is an asset-rich corporation or an affluent individual who neglects to take elementary precautions to protect his or her assets from tort liability.”). Bankruptcy does not shield corporate defendants’ assets in the same way, but bankruptcy predictably results in tort plaintiffs receiving pennies on the dollar for their tort judgments. 207 See supra notes 1–4 and accompanying text. Recognizing as much, tort plaintiffs regularly settle their claims for amounts within the policy limits of the defendant’s liability insurance. 208 For example, even though physicians often make a substantial amount of money than others, they can use the threat of bankruptcy to effectively shield their personal assets from tort plaintiffs. Consequently, claims for medical malpractice routinely settle within the limits of the physician defendant’s liability insurance policy. See Charles Silver, David A. Hyman, Bernard S. Black & Myungho Paik, Policy Limits, Payouts, and Blood Money: Medical Malpractice Settlements in the Shadow of Insurance , 5 U.C. Irvine L. Rev. 559, 561–62, 580–82 (2015) (reporting results of empirical study finding that for medical malpractice cases in Texas, “98.5% of claims were resolved with payments at or below the primary malpractice policy limits”). Liability insurance and bankruptcy are now so entangled that modern tort liability largely involves insurance money, not blood money. 209 See Abraham & Sharkey, supra note 6, at 2181 (“Liability insurers pay virtually all of the billions of dollars of tort liabilities that individuals incur each year, and the majority of liabilities incurred by commercial and other entities.”).",,0,html_body_unmatched

In 2022, a study spanning ten industry sectors, ranging from Life Sciences to Chemicals, found the median policy limit for liability insurance was uniformly below the trended liability loss costs, typically around half the total, with the largest discrepancy (Rail–Transportation) involving a median policy limit around four times lower than projected liability costs. 237 Chubb, Liability Limit Benchmark & Large Loss Profile by Industry Sector 2023 (2023), https://chubb.com/content/dam/chubb-sites/chubb-com/bm-en/benchmark-report/pdf/chubb_2023benchmarkreport_10_bermuda-web.pdf [ perma.cc/ENV2-NSSC ]. Hence, it is unsurprising that, when faced with extensive tort liabilities, corporations often file for bankruptcy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Due to the scarcity of compensatory resources, a duty encompassing every foreseeable harm can create conflicts among the interests that different individuals have in their physical security, economic resources, and emotional tranquility—compensation for one or more of these interests can come at the expense of the others. To give the physically harmed victims an adequate opportunity to receive full compensation for their injuries, the tort duty must foreclose recovery for the numerous other individuals who foreseeably suffer economic losses or stand-alone emotional harms. In effect, the physical-harm requirement implements the equitable principle, the “worst should go first.” 240 Cf. Peter H. Schuck, The Worst Should Go First: Deferral Registries in Asbestos Litigation , 15 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 541 (1992) (invoking this equitable maxim to justify “deferral registries” in asbestos cases that prioritize claims of those with the most serious physical harms over those with less serious physical harms).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"To test whether the physical-harm requirement implements such a “worst goes first” equitable maxim, we can consider its established exceptions. As courts have recognized, the “physical injury rule is not a shibboleth to be honored without understanding its purpose and origin . . . . In applying the physical injury rule, it is important to consider why the rule exists and whether these purposes are at work in this case.” 242 Sullivan v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. , 431 F. Supp. 3d. 448, 452–53 (D. Vt. 2019). Consequently, when the purposes or rationales for the physical-harm requirement “are weak or absent,” the Restatement (Third) of Torts observes that courts are willing to “recognize duties of care” in cases of pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional harm. 243 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Econ. Harm § 1 cmt. d ( A.L.I. 2020) (discussing pure economic loss); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Physical & Emotional Harm § 47 ( A.L.I. 2012). The question, then, is whether courts depart from the requirement of physical harm when doing so would not violate the equitable principle, “the worst should go first.” If so, this basic limitation of negligence liability provides another important example of how compensatory resource scarcity factors into substantive tort law as a matter of principle.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Courts will expand the duty beyond the zone of danger to encompass stand-alone emotional distress in only very limited circumstances. “Specifically, courts have imposed liability on hospitals and funeral homes for negligently mishandling a corpse and on telegraph companies for negligently mistranscribing or misdirecting a telegram that informs the recipient, erroneously, about the death of a loved one.” 247 Id. § 47 cmt. b. But “[o]utside these categories, courts may entirely preclude distress claims.” 248 Dobbs, Hayden & Bublick , supra note 5, § 390, at 572.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For tort purposes, there are two normatively different types of pure economic losses not proximately caused by a predicate physical harm. The first involves financial harms that arise within contractual settings, such as the cost a consumer incurs to repair a defective product. Subject to certain exceptions, the contractually based economic loss rule bars tort recovery for these injuries. 249 See E. River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U.S. 858 (1986). These tort rules are justified by the need to maintain the integrity of the tort-contract boundary; they turn on the ability of right-holders to adequately protect their interests by contracting and are not relevant for our purposes. 250 See generally Mark A. Geistfeld, The Contractually Based Economic Loss Rile in Tort Law: Endangered Consumers and the Error of East River Steamship, 65 DePaul L. Rev. 393 (2016) (demonstrating that courts properly limit recovery for pure economic losses in product cases when consumers do not have enough information about product risks and safety to adequately protect their interests by contracting). The second type of pure economic loss occurs outside of contractual settings. As is true for the contractually based economic-loss rule, this one also bars recovery for pure economic losses subject to certain exceptions. The rationale for limiting the tort duty for these economic losses implicates the same concerns about excessive liability applicable to claims for stand-alone emotional distress.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"[W]e pointed to a hypothetical scenario similar in many ways to the case now before us. We considered a situation where “a defendant negligently causes an automobile accident that blocks a major traffic artery such as a bridge or tunnel.” That defendant would of course be liable for “personal injuries and property damage suffered in such an accident.” But would “any court,” we continued, “allow recovery by the myriad [other] third parties who might claim [purely] economic losses because the bridge or tunnel” was blocked? Based on concerns about limitless liability and unending litigation, as well as on long-standing legal consensus, we considered that prospect “doubtful.” 251 S. Cal. Gas Co. v. Superior Ct. L.A.

Relying on these cases and explaining why these same concerns applied to the case at hand—a months-long massive leakage of natural gas in a suburb outside Los Angeles—the court dismissed the claims of several small businesses in the area seeking recovery for their lost profits not proximately caused by any damage to their real or tangible property. 253 Id. at 888–96.,,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As is true for the cases on which it relied, the court did not mention the problem of insolvency and the associated need to prioritize the claims of physically harmed victims. The tort duty encompassed physical harms, just like it did in the hypothetical automobile accident the court discussed in which the “defendant would of course be liable for ‘personal injuries and property damage.’ ” If the duty in these cases were expanded to encompass both the physically harmed victim(s) and those who might suffer foreseeable economic losses, there would be a massive increase in the number of tort claimants, as the California Supreme Court recognized. That liability would be excessive insofar as insolvency would be a predictable consequence, leading to the question of why insolvency provides a principled reason to limit the substantive tort duty.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"An exclusive focus on the defendant’s interests only implicates the defendant’s unreasonable exercise of liberty. The defendant negligently caused all these foreseeable harms, and insolvency would not lead to debtor’s prison. An unreasonable liberty interest is not plausibly prioritized over the conflicting interests of foreseeable accident victims, whether those interests involve physical security or economic harms. Like the now outdated concern about culpability, the defendant’s interests do not provide a principled justification for substantively limiting the tort duty to fend off bankruptcy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The principled concern about bankruptcy instead derives from the security interests of right-holders, which have priority over the conflicting economic interests of the other accident victims.

,,,,"In an asbestos case, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized this equitable problem, 254 See Metro-N. Commuter R.R. v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424, 442 (1997). and a few other courts have followed suit in the context of a mass tort. 255 See Caronia v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 5 N.E.3d 11, 18 (N.Y. 2013) (invoking this equitable concern in a tobacco case); Henry v. Dow Chem.

Monsanto Co., 813 So. 2d 827, 828, 831 (Ala. 2001) (invoking this equitable concern for a case brought by the plaintiff on “behalf of himself and a putative class of persons similarly situated, . . . asserting that he and others similarly situated have been exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (‘PCBs’), a known hazardous substance, released into the environment in the Anniston area by the defendant”). Like the asbestos cases, mass torts have become a synonym for bankruptcy within tort adjudication. 256 Cf. Jack B. Weinstein & Eileen B. Hershenov, The Effect of Equity on Mass Tort Law , 1991 U. Ill. L. Rev. 269, 290 (1991) (“The actuality or imminent probability of bankruptcy has increasingly come to dominate most mass tort, or at least mega-mass tort, litigation. Our view is that from the beginning mass torts should be treated similarly to a bankruptcy proceeding.”). A focus on the problem of bankruptcy quickly leads to the insight that tort liability must be limited by the physical-harm requirement so that the “worst can go first.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The “worst goes first” equitable rationale for the physical-harm requirement might seem to be an implausibly blunt legal instrument for managing the problem of insolvency. Perhaps the appropriate set of procedural rules would provide a much more sensible way to fairly distribute a defendant’s limited pool of assets across multiple tort claimants. 259 Cf. Dobbs, Hayden & Bublick , supra note 5, § 383, at 540 n.7 (suggesting that “it would be possible to expand interpleader or otherwise provide for common distribution system when claims exceed assets”). Such a procedural solution would make limiting the substantive duty unnecessary to give the physically harmed victims a reasonable opportunity to obtain full recovery.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Although a legislature could enact such a procedural scheme, a common-law court does not have that kind of power. The common law developed in the writ system, a highly individualized form of adjudication. A single claimant could bring only a single claim for relief by way of a single writ. 260 See Sir John H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 63 (5th ed. 2019) (“The choice of original writ governed the whole course of litigation from beginning to end, since the procedures and methods of trial available in an action commenced by one kind of writ were not necessarily available in another.”). The prevailing tort plaintiff in each individual case would have a debt claim against the defendant for the full amount of compensatory damages. Multiple plaintiffs would have multiple debt claims against the same defendant. To equitably distribute an insolvent defendant’s assets across all these claims, a court would have to reduce the defendant’s debt owed to some or all the individual plaintiffs. Within the United States, common-law courts did not have such power. 261 See Sturges v. Crowninshield, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 122 (1819) (holding that it is unconstitutional for states to discharge preexisting debts); see also Ogden v.

Outside bankruptcy—that is, within the common law of torts—the only way for courts to prioritize among tort claimants is by substantively limiting the tort duty to effectively implement the equitable principle, the “worst should go first.” This substantive solution to managing the problem of insolvency is crude compared to an idealized procedural alternative, but it is the only one that has been and continues to be available to courts in tort cases.",,0,html_body_unmatched

See generally Mark A. Geistfeld, Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts: Carrying Calabresi Further , J.L. & Contemp. Probs. , no. 2, 2014, at 165 (showing how a compensatory norm generates tort rules that adequately satisfy the demands of the Pareto principle for social interactions constrained by transaction costs). As for the central normative importance of the Pareto principle for welfarist interpretations of tort law, see Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Fairness Versus Welfare 54–56, 54 n.76 (2002) for an argument that any nonwelfarist rationale for tort law violates the Pareto principle and should be rejected for that reason.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,"The requisite logic is inherent within cost-benefit analysis. For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 Theoretical Inquiries L. 387, 394–96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder’s willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
