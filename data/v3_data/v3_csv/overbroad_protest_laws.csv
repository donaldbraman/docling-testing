,,,,"Protests are woven into the history and social fabric of the United States. Whether the topic involves racial inequity, abortion, police brutality, oil and gas pipelines, war, or allegedly stolen elections, Americans will voice their opposition—occasionally, in frightening or destructive ways. Politicians, in turn, have a history of using their lawmaking power to discourage protest by creating crimes like unlawful assembly, riot, civil disorder, disorderly conduct, trespass, and others. While lawmakers have considerable power to decide what is and isn’t legal, they cannot criminalize expression or assembly that the First Amendment protects. But the lines delineating what forms of protest the government can and cannot criminalize are anything but bright.",,0,html_body_unmatched

First, it analyzes decades of Supreme Court case law addressing overbreadth claims arising from protests and articulates five features of protest-related laws that generate overbreadth concerns. Second, the Piece surveys statutes that lawmakers and law enforcement officials have used to deter protests and, employing the five features of overbroad laws, examines which statutes present overbreadth concerns.
