1,PLATFORM LIABILITY FOR PLATFORM MANIPULATION,section_header,body_text,This Note introduces a paradigm of corporate liability for social media platforms that facilitate platform manipulation. It argues that courts must appreciate platform design as a dimension of corporate conduct by explicating the extension of common law tort liability to platform design. This Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm crucially clarifies the bounds of accountability for the design choices of social media companies and is well-suited to respond to the law’s systemic discounting of platform design. Existing legal frameworks fail to account for the unique and content-agnostic enmeshment between platforms and those who manipulate platforms to abuse users. PDN in turn offers a constitutive baseline for a society with less rampant technology-enabled deception.,,75.0,matched

2,INTRODUCTION,section_header,body_text,"In Part I, this Note surveys the landscape of platform manipulation, discussing the harms caused by platform-based deception as well as the design choices that enable platform manipulation in practice. It also explores how social media companies profit from the scam economy. Part II turns to the absence of legal frameworks that apply to social media companies’ design choices in the context of platform manipulation. It underscores the relationship between platform design and platform manipulation. It also delineates the pitfalls of the prevailing voluntary self-governance paradigm for platform manipulation. Finally, Part III introduces the PDN paradigm that can serve social media companies, lawmakers, and victims as they pursue legal remedies and design inter-ventions that curb the growing challenge of platform manipulation.",,75.0,matched

It argues that courts must appreciate platform design as a dimension of corporate conduct by explicating the extension of common law tort liability to platform design. This Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm crucially clarifies the bounds of accountability for the design choices of social media companies and is well-suited to respond to the law’s systemic discounting of platform design. Existing legal frameworks fail to account for the unique and content-agnostic enmeshment between platforms and those who manipulate platforms to abuse users. PDN in turn offers a constitutive baseline for a society with less rampant technology-enabled deception.,,76.66666666666666,matched

PLATFORM DESIGN NEGLIGENCE: A NEW PARADIGM FOR PLATFORM LIABILITY,section_header,body_text,"This Note is the first to argue for a social media liability paradigm that centers platform design choices: a Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm that establishes the circumstances for a clear assumption of liability in this digital environment. It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine. 30 30 See infra Part III. ...

Platform Design Negligence in Theory,section_header,body_text,"This Note is the first to argue for a social media liability paradigm that centers platform design choices: a Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm that establishes the circumstances for a clear assumption of liability in this digital environment. It offers a roadmap for an evolution in law and society towards coherent parlance on the impacts of twenty-first century platform technologies. Social media companies should face liability when their design choices contribute to the deception of their users. When companies are aware of these deception risks and fail to take reasonable precautions, they cease to function as reasonable platforms and should become liable for injuries that follow. Through a full-throated adoption of this paradigm, victims and law enforcers could hold social media companies accountable for harms caused by manipulation conducted on, by, and through their platforms. Both federal and state courts, without the mandate of a statute, can actualize this paradigm by applying and building upon existing common law tort doctrine. 30 30 See infra Part III. ...

44,B. The Platform Design Negligence Paradigm in Practice,section_header,body_text,This Note introduces a paradigm of corporate liability for social media platforms that facilitate platform manipulation. It argues that courts must appreciate platform design as a dimension of corporate conduct by explicating the extension of common law tort liability to platform design. This Platform Design Negligence (PDN) paradigm crucially clarifies the bounds of accountability for the design choices of social media companies and is well-suited to respond to the law’s systemic discounting of platform design. Existing legal frameworks fail to account for the unique and content-agnostic enmeshment between platforms and those who manipulate platforms to abuse users. PDN in turn offers a constitutive baseline for a society with less rampant technology-enabled deception.,,81.4814814814815,matched
44,"The  PDN  paradigm  stands  for  the  proposition  that  social  media companies are directly responsible to each individual user, and when those companies make design choices  that  facilitate  deception  through  their platforms, they may be negligent. A number of courts have recognized that platform design decisions do not receive § 230 immunity. 244  At the same time,  courts,  law  enforcers,  and  plaintiffs  alike  struggle  to  point  to common law or statutory bases for their arguments linking their harms to the  platform  design  choices. 245   PDN  represents  an  entry  point  for lawmakers and industry professionals seeking to curb platform manipulation  on  their  platforms. 246 It  operates  on  a  dual  track,  first drawing on background presumptions of tort liability under federal and state common law to bring PDN claims, and, second, guiding lawmakers to  pass  legislation  that  prescribes  social  media  liability  for  platform manipulation  and  shields  PDN  claims  from  arbitration  agreements, among other measures. 247",text,text,,,55.55555555555556,unmatched

Taamneh , in which the Supreme Court determined that plaintiffs failed to show that a social media platform's algorithmic choices rose to the level of impermissible conduct under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act ( JASTA). 253 There, the conduct at issue was highly attenuated insofar as the plaintiffs could not connect the real-world terrorist attack with the terrorist group's use of social media. 254   On the other hand, in platform manipulation,  individual  social  media  users  are  victimized  by  the  onplatform conduct that serves as the basis of the PDN claim. 255  Platform design operates as customer service-the principal business relationship that the Supreme Court in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez found that concrete injuries in fact arose from. 256 Specifically, the Supreme Court affirmed the presence of concrete injuries when customers' platforms were tainted by misleading statements (i.e., labels) imposed on the customer's profile and exported to third parties. 257   Platform manipulation more clearly creates real-world harms to victims than did the credit check company's wrongful labeling of customers as 'terrorists' in TransUnion ; the harm to customers in platform manipulation bears 'a 'close relationship' to the harm' that is already recognized in tort liability for consumer product designs. 258  Thus PDN claims are ripe for success under the current standard for proving standing  with  monetary  and  nonmonetary  injuries-claims  that  when properly brought under the 'typical limits on tort liability' could affect industry incentives. 259",text,text,,,61.111111111111114,unmatched

,,,,,"“Manipulation” offers three meanings in the context of liability for social media companies. In this Note, “manipulation” in “platform manipulation” primarily refers to the practices of malicious actors, such as scammers, who exploit the design of platforms to achieve their desired outcomes. These manipulators largely seek to deceive platform users to secure financial gain. In this way, “platform manipulation” is a triple entendre; it refers to malicious actors’ manipulation of the design of social media platforms, malicious actors’ manipulation of social media users, and platforms’ own manipulation of their users by way of their platform design.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
