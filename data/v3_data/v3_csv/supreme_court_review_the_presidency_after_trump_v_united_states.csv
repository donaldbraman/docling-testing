Garland, Att’y Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Just., Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks on the Appointment of a Special Counsel (Nov. 18, 2022), https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-appointment-special-counsel . Smith retained many lawyers and investigators who had worked on the January 6 case prior to his appointment and hired new staff.

Post (Sept. 10, 2023), https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/10/jack-smith-special-counsel-trump-investigations . Under Justice Department regulations, Smith had the powers of a U.S. Attorney and had to “comply” with Department rules and policies and “consult” with appropriate Department offices about them. 28 C.F.R. § 600.6–7(a) (2022). The Attorney General retained the authority to request from the Special Counsel “an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step,” and the power to “conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” Id. § 600.7(b). A Special Counsel is thus quasi-independent from the Attorney General, who is constitutionally subject to presidential direction but by virtue of norms—at least through the presidency of Joseph Biden—is independent of the White House.

Trump’s failure to discuss Category Three constraints on congressional power in the courts below is especially remarkable because the government had hinted at such constraints as a basis for immunity. See, e.g. , Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on Presidential Immunity Grounds at 35, Trump , 704 F. Supp. 3d 196 (No. 23-CR-00257), ECF No. 109. One might speculate that Trump’s lawyers declined to raise the issue of separation of powers vis-à-vis Congress because they viewed the argument as a defense on the merits to be raised at a different time and perhaps did not want to raise the issue at the motion to dismiss stage for fear that they would not be able to raise Harlow -type immunity on interlocutory appeal. But this speculation is implausible since, as explained above, the Trump team raised many other issues in the motions to dismiss that were clearly defenses and could clearly be appealed only after trial. In addition, as Justice Barrett wrote in her concurrence, there was a powerful argument that the separation of powers claim, even if a defense, was still subject to interlocutory review. See Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 651–55 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring in part); infra note 67 and accompanying text.",99.83174425126192,matched

,,,,,"109 Myers v. United States , 272 U.S. 52 (1926), endorsed a famously broad version of the unitary executive theory, but it contained qualifications. For example, Myers reserved the possibility that “if a statute ‘specifically committed [a given set of decisions] to the discretion of a particular officer’ or established a ‘quasi-judicial … executive tribunal[] whose decisions after hearing affect [the] interests of individuals,’ then Congress might properly foreclose the President from intervening in the decision of a particular case.” Goldsmith & Manning, supra note 89, at 1840–41 (quoting Myers , 272 U.S. at 135). Myers also left in place the rule of Perkins that “when Congress, by law, vests the appointment of inferior oﬃcers in the heads of departments, it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest” because “[t]he constitutional authority in congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as congress may enact in relation to the oﬃcers so appointed.” Myers , 272 U.S. at 160 (quoting United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886)); see also id. at 127, 161–62; supra notes 97–98 and accompanying text (examining the extent to which Perkins survives Trump ).",0,html_footnote_unmatched
