1,"This Note is a theoretical analysis of the way battered woman syndrome operates in our criminal justice system. Although evidence of prolonged, severe domestic  abuse  could  operate  as  a  basis  to  exact  mercy  on  (i.e.,  reduce  or eliminate punishment for) a defendant, our legal system's acknowledgement of these  circumstances,  in  the  form  of  battered  woman  syndrome,  is  instead actualized as a way to calibrate just punishment. In particular, this Note explains the critical distinction between 'justice' and 'mercy' as defined by criminal law scholars, focusing on how battered woman syndrome-or battering and its effects-might fit into each category and exploring the ways in which battered woman  syndrome  evidence  has  been  adapted  to  fit  the  contours  of  our institutions as a justice practice rather than as a mercy practice. Additionally, this Note discusses several obstacles to battered woman syndrome's use as a vehicle for mercy in the courtroom as well as on an institutional level. Among these  obstacles  are  evidence  rules,  jury  instructions,  public  opinion,  and common misconceptions regarding domestic violence-and victims of domestic violence-which affect jury verdicts and clemency decisions for battered women defendants. Other scholars have surveyed the effectiveness of battered woman syndrome evidence at obtaining acquittals, critiqued the theory on psychological, jurisprudential, and feminist grounds, or evaluated its fit with self-defense  doctrine.  This  Note  analyzes  battered  woman  syndrome  from  a different angle, in the context of prevailing mercy theories, and compares its theoretical alignment  with  mercy  literature  to  its actual justice-oriented application in our criminal justice system. Further, this Note hypothesizes about the facets of our intuitions that account for the disparity between theoretical and practical applications of battered woman syndrome evidence and that prevent battered woman syndrome from being meaningfully realized as an institutional ground for mercy.",text,footnote,,.

Battered woman syndrome evidence was originally devised to mitigate injustice to battered women defendants. 3 Its aim is to contextualize battered women defendants' behavior  in  a  way  that  more  closely  aligns  with  traditional  self-defense elements in the hope of procuring the affirmative defense. 4 Because battered woman syndrome has been operationalized as a justice practice, the features of  our  criminal  justice  system  and  public  intuitions  applicable  to  battered women prevent evidence of prolonged suffering and abuse-which could serve as a ground for mercy-from  being actualized as a mercy consideration.

[5] More specifically, “an offender’s deserved punishment—proportioned to the offender’s moral blameworthiness—is classically a function of the nature and extent of the wrongdoing, the accompanying culpable state of mind, justifying circumstances at the time of that wrongdoing, and a robust assessment of the offender’s capacity to have avoided the wrongdoing.” [6] In contrast, mercy involves a conscious decision to impose less punishment than an actor deserves in light of their culpable act because of some other factor, extrinsic to a strict retributivist calculus. [7] In this way, mercy and justice are inherently in tension with one another; to be merciful necessarily requires one to be unjust. [8] Mercy is emphatically not imposing a punishment less than what is dictated by legal justice but which aligns with a deontological measure of desert.

[94] Results showed only a marginal difference in the liability and blameworthiness assigned to a criminal actor when the actor killed an attacker–victim who was unarmed (and therefore deadly force was unnecessary) as compared to an actor who killed in response to no threat. [95] These results bolster the notion that the general public finds killing an unarmed attacker—or killing in the absence of a threat—to be blameworthy conduct. [96] From an outside perspective (i.e., one that lacks information on battering and its effects), the narrative of a battered woman defendant is that of a woman who chose to kill in a nonconfrontational setting, in the absence of a threat, instead of leaving an allegedly abusive relationship. In other words, to the public, the question of punishment does not hinge on “whether victims of domestic violence have suffered,” but whether they should be “absolve[d] . . . of personal responsibility if they choose to take a human life—even the life of a vicious abuser—when there is available the option of taking another course to escape the abuse.” [97] Further, a prevailing fear of vigilantism makes individuals wary of “the manipulation of” battered woman syndrome “as a rationalization for cold-blooded, premeditated murder.” [98] These thought processes and misconceptions about battered women hinder the development of widespread compassion or sympathy for battered women who resort to violence on a societal level.",,77.35849056603774,matched

Using battered woman syndrome testimony to explain battered women’s actions is “an artificial, if well-intentioned, ‘stretching’ of these categories [of self-defense] to achieve the desired result of a less severe punishment.” [67] This artificial stretching fails to achieve its goal because battered woman syndrome evidence “introduces the idea that the woman has a psychological abnormality that makes her act in a certain way, yet it seeks to justify her act as a reasonable person who weighed the options of harm and greater harm.” [68] Thus, battered woman syndrome evidence often fails to achieve the reduction in punishment it aims for.",,98.69281045751634,matched

15,IV. Barriers to the Institutionalization of Mercy: Empirical Desert,section_header,body_text,"Notably, protecting the criminal law’s moral credibility also means eliminating reliance on factors that the community finds irrelevant to determining punishment. [112] Conversely, reducing punishment according to factors the community finds irrelevant to determining blameworthiness, but still relevant to setting punishment, can enhance the law’s moral credibility. [113] Robinson found public support for a few factors unrelated to blameworthiness that the community regards as acceptable grounds for reducing punishment and, therefore, as potential grounds for mercy. [114] Those factors included acknowledging guilt and apologizing in situations where punishing an offender would impose hardship on their family. [115] Thus, the institutionalization of mercy on specified grounds that have community support could serve to further align institutional distribution of punishment with community intuitions. [116] This suggests that “a criminal justice system, with some careful effort, might be able to construct guidance mechanisms that would allow it to fairly institutionalize the exercise of mercy in those situations in which the community supports its exercise.” [117] Because the factors Robinson reports may, but will not always, apply to battered women defendants, there currently does not seem to be space to categorically institutionalize mercy for battered women who kill their abusers. However, there could be an opportunity to institutionalize mercy for these candidates in the future without undermining the criminal law’s moral credibility on any other bases that develop community support.",,70.1492537313433,matched
15,"In order to create the sort of freedom necessary for individual decision makers to rely on mercy considerations in doling out punishment, permission to  do  so  would  need to be institutionalized. However, to ensure justice is fairly  distributed,  the  criminal  justice  system  must  maintain  a  level  of consistency and moral credibility that can be incompatible with an institution-wide distribution of mercy. 75 The moral credibility of a criminal justice  system  is  rooted  in  the  community's  faith  that  criminal  justice institutions impose punishment that roughly tracks the community's consensus of blameworthiness. 76 Public opinion regarding battered women and what constitutes justifiable self-defense, influenced by negative stereotypes  and  misconceptions  about  domestic  violence  and  community intuitions about moral culpability, creates the measure of empirical desert the community assigns to battered women who kill their abusers. 77 In actuality, empirical desert on this issue is likely closely aligned with the measure of institutional desert doled out by our existing self-defense laws. Institutionalizing  mercy  by  reducing  punishment  under  circumstances  in which the wider community does not perceive lower culpability or any other ground  to  reduce  punishment  undermines  the  credibility  of  our  criminal justice system. 78 Although education on battering and its effects can induce sympathy  for  battered  women,  the  general  public  is  not  educated  on  the realities of domestic violence. 79 Thus, prevailing community sentiments are unlikely to support institutional rules that would carve out space for mercy for  battered  women  defendants  whose  behavior  does  not  fit  in  a  legal definition of self-defense.",text,footnote,,.

[3] Its aim is to contextualize battered women defendants’ behavior in a way that more closely aligns with traditional self-defense elements in the hope of procuring the affirmative defense. [4] Because battered woman syndrome has been operationalized as a justice practice, the features of our criminal justice system and public intuitions applicable to battered women prevent evidence of prolonged suffering and abuse—which could serve as a ground for mercy—from being actualized as a mercy consideration.

[90] This is because “[t]o characterize a homicide as ‘justifiable’ is to say that killing the abuser while he sleeps is the right, good, or proper thing to do, or, at least, that killing him constitutes a tolerable, permissible, or non-wrongful outcome.” [91] In actuality, the societal consensus—reflected in self-defense doctrine developed over time in response to society’s intuitions—is that one should not resort to taking the life of another unless there are truly no other means available to remedy a situation. [92] In the interest of promoting public safety, the law discourages taking the life of another whenever possible. However, Paul Robinson, in a study measuring public intuitions about culpability as compared to the existing criminal law, found that laypersons typically view “a killing that has some claim to be carried out in self-defense” as deserving of lesser punishment, even when a defendant “incorrectly but honestly believes that use of deadly force is necessary. ” [93]",,96.60460021905804,matched
18,"Importantly, participants in Robinson's study tended to assign liability according to the seriousness of the threat of harm. 94 Results showed only a marginal  difference  in  the  liability  and  blameworthiness  assigned  to  a criminal actor when the actor killed an attacker-victim who was unarmed (and therefore deadly force was unnecessary) as compared to an actor who killed  in  response  to  no  threat. 95 These  results  bolster  the  notion  that  the general public finds killing an unarmed attacker-or killing in the absence of a threat-to be blameworthy conduct. 96 From an outside perspective (i.e., one that lacks information on battering and its effects), the narrative of a battered woman defendant is that of a woman who chose to kill in a nonconfrontational setting, in the absence of a threat, instead of leaving an allegedly abusive relationship. In other words, to the public, the question of punishment does not hinge on 'whether victims of domestic violence have suffered,' but whether they should be 'absolve[d] . . . of personal responsibility if they choose to take a human life-even the life of a vicious abuser-when there is available the option of taking another course to escape the abuse.' 97 Further, a prevailing fear of vigilantism makes individuals wary of 'the manipulation of' battered woman syndrome 'as a rationalization for cold-blooded, premeditated murder.' 98 These thought processes and misconceptions about battered women hinder the development of widespread compassion or sympathy for battered women who resort to violence on a societal level.",text,footnote,,.

Empirical Desert and Moral Credibility of the Criminal Justice System,section_header,body_text,"The community’s misconceptions about battered women, combined with its intuitions about what constitutes justifiable self-defense, have implications beyond the case-by-case opportunities of individual decision makers to grant mercy. These prevailing sentiments regarding domestic violence victims prevent the exercise of bestowing mercy on battered women defendants from being a viable institutional practice. In this context, there seems to be an alignment of empirical and institutional desert—public intuitions about just punishment in these circumstances roughly track the levels of institutional punishments in place. An institution that creates a criminal punishment scheme that substantially deviates from empirical desert risks jeopardizing the moral credibility of its criminal justice system. [137] Society’s intuitions about justifiable self-defense do not encompass situations in which battered women kill in a nonconfrontational setting.

[1] Theoretically then, victims of domestic violence who resort to killing their abusers as a means of escape are quintessential candidates for mercy.

,,,,"Notably, “[m]ercy is a virtue of [the people who administer the law] rather than of the institution of punishment” itself. [17] Institutions are constructed with justice in mind. The “regular enforcement of the rules that make social stability (and thus social life) possible” depends on the equal administration of just punishments. [18] However, “[p]ersons who administer the rules of the institution may be formally invested with the prerogative of mercy.” [19] There are numerous spaces within our criminal justice process and procedures where individuals are tasked with the implementation of institutional or legal justice. Significantly, judges and other individuals who serve as representatives of the criminal justice system cannot always justifiably show mercy because their “job is to uphold an entire system of justice that protects the security of all citizens.” [20] In other words, “there is no feasible way of granting to those who are less fortunate in the undeserved suffering they endure a right to more lenient treatment” from within the criminal justice system without granting institutional actors license to act arbitrarily, which would “seriously undermin[e] the goal of social security.” [21] In contrast, within criminal justice processes, certain individuals, like jurors, who are not tasked with upholding the credibility of our institutions, have the opportunity to enact mercy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Individuals acting within our criminal justice system, as opposed to institutional actors who represent the entire criminal justice system, can enact mercy because, at its core, mercy involves a voluntary waiver of one’s right to enact punishment or receive retribution. [22] In a criminal context, an offender is thought of as violating the rights of an entire community, and therefore, it is the community who may rightfully waive its right to punish. [23] Jurors, as representatives of the community, can rightly choose to exercise or forfeit the community’s right to punish. One reason individuals may decide to be merciful is that in cases in which an offender “succumbs, in despair, to a temptation to commit some crime, when he probably would not even have been so tempted had his life not been so miserable,” it seems cruel to exact the deserved punishment on top of the offender’s previous suffering, even though the suffering does not itself excuse or justify the crime. [24] In this way, mercy can be seen as an attempt to “compensate the less fortunate” for previous undeserved suffering by imposing a less harsh punishment than an individual has the right to demand based on the offense. [25] The “salience” of mercy considerations lies in humanitarian concerns in evaluating the effect a just punishment will have on an actor’s “well-being in the light of a searching and empathetic scrutiny of their character, life history and the broader context of their wrongdoing.” [26] Thus, individuals may be compelled to extend mercy by some sense of compassion or benevolence but are never obligated to do so.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Decision makers might reduce punishment in these circumstances not because the offenders did not act culpably but out of a compulsion to treat them in a compassionate and humane manner. That is, one may believe that “what was ‘wrong’ were external circumstances that we believe, but for the grace of God, would probably have caused us, as well, to act unlawfully.” [27] Even if the battered woman culpably committed an intentional killing correlated with a level of deserved punishment, her overall suffering could be “cruelly exacerbated by the infliction in full measure of [her] just deserts.” [28] Therefore, her situation properly elicits compassion that might lead to a reduced punishment, bestowed out of pure benevolence.",,0,html_body_unmatched

[37] While these phases do not occur in every battering relationship, they were commonly reported by participants in Walker’s studies. [38] The confluence of the unpredictability of an abuser’s behavior in the first two phases and the abuser’s kindness and remorse in the third phase reinforce the idea that one should stay in the relationship and leads to what Walker calls “learned helplessness,” which is characterized by feelings of lack of control over the outcome of one’s situation and a belief that one cannot escape their abuser.

In other words, the admission of battered woman syndrome evidence is perceived as the minimum of what’s required to fulfill the demands of justice, rather than a pathway to mercy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Moreover, the particular way battered woman syndrome evidence is utilized in the confines of the self-defense justification necessarily prevents it from providing a basis for mercy practices. Justification and excuse defenses are integral components of a criminal justice paradigm. [48] Both justifications and excuses operate to help calculate an actor’s retributive desert by lowering punishment according to a lower perceived culpability. [49] When a defendant claims an affirmative defense of justification, they “claim[] that the act was right or, at least, legally permissible, while a plea of excuse concedes that the act was wrongful, but claims that the actor should not be blamed for it.” [50] More specifically, in a justification context, acts taken in self-defense are neither culpable nor condemnable. [51] Operationalizing battered woman syndrome evidence as a way to support a self-defense justification promotes the idea that victims of domestic violence should receive diminished punishment because they are less culpable, and thus it is just to impose less punishment. This justice-oriented reasoning is inconsistent with mercy, which dictates acknowledging culpability and still reducing punishment in the interest of preventing additional suffering. In this way, utilizing battered woman syndrome evidence to bolster a justification defense roots battered woman syndrome firmly in a justice practice.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Because battered woman syndrome was intended to address justice concerns and has been implemented as a justice practice, institutional structures designed to protect the administration of justice, namely evidence rules and jury instructions, prevent individuals from enacting mercy even when they may want to. Historically, evidence rules, crafted to ensure fair trials and to prevent unduly prejudicing or misleading the jury, could keep battered woman syndrome evidence out of trials altogether. [52] The Frye [53] general acceptance standard for admissibility of expert testimony allowed judges to keep out expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome on the basis that the methodology and science behind it was not generally accepted. [54] This was especially an issue in the 1980’s when research about battered woman syndrome and the effects of domestic violence was in its infancy. [55] Battered woman syndrome evidence was criticized on the grounds that identifying which homicide defendants were truly battered women was difficult and for fear that the evidence would prejudice or confuse the jury. [56] In response to these concerns, in the early 1990’s 20% of states required a defendant to first prove she was a battered woman, and over 25% of states required some showing that battered woman syndrome was accepted in the scientific community before admitting battered woman syndrome expert testimony. [57]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Without expert testimony, factfinders often had no basis on which to reduce punishment on justice or mercy bases. With no context provided for the defendant’s actions or mental state, no reasonable jury could find that a battered woman who killed her abuser in a nonconfrontational setting had a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious harm; thus, jurors had no reason to conclude a battered woman’s actions were justifiable. Similarly, the absence of battered woman syndrome testimony meant that jurors were likely left without any information on which to base mercy considerations—there was no evidence that would elicit the kind of sympathy or compassion that might compel jurors to recommend a reduced punishment. In 1993, the federal standard for expert testimony admissibility changed. Under the Daubert [58] standard, embodied in Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome is admitted if a judge finds it sufficiently reliable, based on several criteria. [59] Most states now follow some variation of the Daubert standard and admit some form of expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome (or battering and its effects) to support a self-defense claim.

[62] Moreover, these convictions are frequently upheld on appeal. [63] In fact, one study reported a 71% affirmance rate of murder convictions or sentences of battered women defendants, despite the use of admissible expert testimony on battering and its effects at trial. [64] This indicates that battered woman syndrome may not be as effective in contextualizing a battered woman’s behavior to fit within the self-defense justification as proponents had hoped.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Thus, jurors who follow jury instructions to find the defendant guilty unless the defendant’s actions fit into the self-defense framework tend to find battered women defendants guilty even in light of battered woman syndrome testimony. [70] Moreover, when the jury does acquit or recommend a less severe punishment after receiving instructions on the self-defense justification, it is because they have decided the defendant’s behavior meets the self-defense criteria, and therefore their act merits less punishment. In reducing or eliminating punishment on the basis of culpability, the jury is performing a justice practice, rather than engaging in a mercy practice.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In this way, the design of our criminal justice system can prevent individual actors from extending mercy, even in circumstances where they would be inclined to do so. Thus, it is only in the rare instances when individuals are freed from justice-oriented rules and responsibilities that the potential to extend mercy exists.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In order to create the sort of freedom necessary for individual decision makers to rely on mercy considerations in doling out punishment, permission to do so would need to be institutionalized. However, to ensure justice is fairly distributed, the criminal justice system must maintain a level of consistency and moral credibility that can be incompatible with an institution-wide distribution of mercy. [75] The moral credibility of a criminal justice system is rooted in the community’s faith that criminal justice institutions impose punishment that roughly tracks the community’s consensus of blameworthiness. [76] Public opinion regarding battered women and what constitutes justifiable self-defense, influenced by negative stereotypes and misconceptions about domestic violence and community intuitions about moral culpability, creates the measure of empirical desert the community assigns to battered women who kill their abusers. [77] In actuality, empirical desert on this issue is likely closely aligned with the measure of institutional desert doled out by our existing self-defense laws. Institutionalizing mercy by reducing punishment under circumstances in which the wider community does not perceive lower culpability or any other ground to reduce punishment undermines the credibility of our criminal justice system. [78] Although education on battering and its effects can induce sympathy for battered women, the general public is not educated on the realities of domestic violence. [79] Thus, prevailing community sentiments are unlikely to support institutional rules that would carve out space for mercy for battered women defendants whose behavior does not fit in a legal definition of self-defense.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The widespread misconceptions and stereotypes of battered women, combined with the moral intuitions of the public, result in little to no gap between empirical desert and the institutional desert afforded to battered women defendants; murder in the absence of an immediate or deathly threat is both intuitively and institutionally blameworthy conduct. [99] In turn, this correlation prevents the extension of mercy to battered women who kill their abusers from being a viable institutional practice without undermining the system’s credibility. Robinson defines empirical desert as “determining blameworthiness according to the shared intuitions of justice of the community.” [100] This concept exists in contrast with deontological desert, “derived from the reasoned analysis of moral philosophy,” which underlies a traditional retributivist calculus of blameworthiness and punishment. [101] Accordingly, the empirical desert—or community intuitions of blameworthiness—for battered women who kill their abusers is affected by public perceptions about domestic violence victims and community intuitions about the level of blameworthiness involved in killing under a variety of circumstances, as discussed above. The use of battered woman syndrome evidence at trial, while potentially effective in educating a jury, cannot alter the misconceptions of the broader public and therefore cannot alter the measure of empirical desert correlated with battered women who kill their abusers.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Because empirical desert is likely roughly aligned with the imposed institutional desert in this context, the institutionalization of mercy to battered women defendants could jeopardize the moral credibility and efficacy of our criminal justice system. If one goal of our criminal justice system is to impose deserved punishment, “mitigations of punishment based on mercy—factors unrelated to the offender’s blameworthiness—will set the offender in the wrong rank order as compared to other offenders,” and thus undermine the equitable distribution of just desert. [105] Robinson explains that the efficacy of our criminal justice system depends on the cooperation and deference afforded by both its internal actors and the general public. [106] This is facilitated when the law’s distribution of criminal liability aligns with the community’s intuitions about appropriate behavior and moral attitudes—the community’s determination of empirical justice. [107] This alignment creates a sense of moral credibility and public confidence in our criminal law that lays the foundation for effective crime control, another key goal of our criminal justice system. [108] Conversely, without a sense of moral credibility and “[t]o the extent that people view the system as unjust—as in conflict with their intuitions about justice—that acquiescence and cooperation is likely to fade and be replaced with subversion and resistance.” [109] In this way, aligning institutional desert with empirical desert is crucial to maintaining a stable criminal justice system and is very likely at odds with an institution-wide distribution of mercy to battered women defendants.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Even within the confines and imperatives created by criminal justice institutions, governors do have the option to extend mercy to battered women defendants. They can grant clemency to convicted battered women out of a sense of compassion and a desire to reduce net human suffering. [118] This state executive power is not subject to the same structural barriers to implementing mercy faced by jurors or legislative and judicial representatives of the criminal justice system. [119] However, in practice, clemency actions are, more often than not, utilized as a tool to correct injustice. [120] One explanation for this phenomenon is that, while operationalizing mercy in this context is free from the institutional structural issues using battered woman syndrome evidence encounters, clemency decisions are still constrained by public opinion and empirical desert. Therefore, it is similarly unlikely to be realized as a mercy function for fear of political backlash [121] or concerns of undermining the criminal justice system’s credibility.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Granting clemency or commutation is wholly discretionary—there is no standard to which governors are held in deciding whether to give clemency to a particular individual. [122] Therefore, governors are free to rely on factors unrelated to an offender’s blameworthiness in granting clemency. [123] However, in practice, most governors base their decision on some justice-oriented rationale; many clemency decisions are rooted in an individual’s newfound innocence or in a recognition that our trial system failed them. [124] Clemency decisions based on actual innocence or a failure of the criminal justice system to properly dispense justice are politically acceptable because society perceives clemency actions as a means to correct injustice. [125] For example, in 1990 after the Ohio Supreme Court adopted a rule that entitled battered women defendants to a battered woman defense, Governor Richard Celeste commuted the sentences of twenty-five women who were incarcerated for killing their abusers without the opportunity to use this defense. [126] The Governor concluded that “these women had been treated unjustly by the justice system because the full stories about domestic terrorism they suffered had not been told.” [127] This action illustrates that although governors are free to base clemency actions on factors that do not affect just desert and commute sentences below what is considered the just or deserved punishment, clemency is largely utilized as a last-ditch effort to ensure that justice is properly dispensed.

Thus, these executives are unlikely to grant clemency in cases where it would conflict with the community’s intuitions about innocence and deserved punishment, including those of battered women defendants. Typically “[b]eing perceived as too lenient towards killers can mean political suicide. If a governor is going to consider clemency cases, he or she must carefully craft the rationale for the decision to assist ‘criminals.’” [131] Commuting or suspending sentences of individuals rightly found—or perceived to be—guilty jeopardizes a governor’s political career.

This is primarily because battered woman syndrome was introduced as a justice function intended to work within an institutional justice system. The dominant purpose of battered woman syndrome evidence is to mitigate the perceived injustice that domestic violence victims face as defendants on trial for killing their abusers.
