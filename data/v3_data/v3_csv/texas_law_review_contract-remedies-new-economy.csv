1,Contract Remedies for New-Economy Collaborations,section_header,body_text,"To summarize so far, the reputational sanctions sketched here and the theory that maximizing continuation payoffs relative to defection payoffs best sustains cooperation reflect party attempts to make collaborations work without legal sanctions. Efforts to make contracts self-enforcing also exist in traditional economies; parties everywhere prefer self-enforcement because it is cheap relative to legal enforcement. The goal of self-enforcement, however, assumes heightened importance in the new economy for two reasons: first, as shown, the intertwined and intertemporal nature of framework arrangements precludes frequent recourse to outside enforcers; second, current contract law remedies are not suitable for new-economy collaborations.",,80.95238095238095,matched
1,Alan Schwartz* & Simone M. Sepe**,section_header,footnote,,". Eric Maskin showed that it is possible to design a mechanism that induces the parties truthfully and publicly to verify the observed state of the world by fining them if they disagree on what the realized state is. See generally Eric Maskin, Nash Equilibrium and Welfare Optimality , 66 Rev . Econ. Stud . 23 (1999) (showing that “a social choice rule on an arbitrary domain of preferences can be implemented by a game form if it satisfies two arguably reasonable properties: monotonicity and no veto power ”). John Moore and Rafael Repullo also showed that when some dynamic is introduced in the game, revelation is truthful and implementation is unique as long as fines can be imposed on the parties. See John Moore & Rafael Repullo, Subgame Perfect Implementation , 56 Econometrica 1191, 1194–95 (1988) (explaining the “Revelation Principle”). Fines, however, are unenforceable under current law, so we look elsewhere for a truthful revealing mechanism.

Otherwise, Lilly had no right 'to use the Emisphere Technology or Emisphere Program Technology other than insofar as they relate directly to the Field [i.e., the project] and are expressly granted herein.' 10 After several years, the arrangement broke down before the  parties  developed  a  pill  to  deliver  PTH.

5,A. Traditional-Economy Transactions,section_header,footnote,,". We do not consider two modern commercial areas. Initially, online sales between firms and individual consumers are a major part of today’s economy. We do not consider these sales for two reasons. First, our subject is the business contract. More basically, this Article works in the space in which it is empirically plausible to attribute rationality to the contracting parties. Such an attribution may require justification or modification when one of the parties is an individual person. See, e.g. , Alan Schwartz, Regulating for Rationality , 67 Stan. L. Rev. 1373, 1375–76 (2015) (explaining that studies show that individual “consumers exhibit numerous reasoning errors” that are “attributed to ‘cognitive biases’”). Also, though the deal vehicle is the internet, the typical sale is a traditional-economy transaction which, as defined above, occurs when the firm sells finished goods to an individual consumer in a one-stage transaction under a simple contract. We also do not consider how firms perform when embedded in networks because our focus is procurement—a task networks seldom are created to achieve.

Even if the initial arrangement explicitly provides that the parties would approach disagreements fairly, Firm B may be intransigent if it believes that switching costs would deter Firm A from finding a different partner.  On  the  other  hand,  if  Firm  B  refuses  to  modify  the  initial arrangement, Firm A may infer that Firm B is hiding a serious problem; this belief could cause the parties to escalate their conflict.",text,footnote,,.

Traditional Remedies for Traditional Transactions,section_header,body_text,"Many thousands of multi-firm ventures attempt to develop new products or platforms and many of these fail, yet the case reports are almost silent. Few cases exist because contract law does not offer solutions to the problems of opportunism, exploitation, and differences of belief regarding project success that attend joint-development arrangements. As a result, an important segment of the U.S. economy functions today without a contract law. The justification for a state-supplied contract law, however, is that the law enables parties to make transactions that the parties would otherwise forgo. Collaborations performed well in the extraordinary circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. But an implication of contract law’s absence is that the American economy underproduces productive collaborations in ordinary times. It is this possibility that poses the two tasks we address in this Article: to explain why today’s contract law offers courts no tools for facilitating the new collaborations, and to begin to create a contract law for the facilitation of those collaborations. In pursuing these tasks, it is helpful to start by comparing the new collaborations to more traditional transactions.",,75.26881720430107,matched

The Specialized-Goods Case,section_header,body_text,"Turning to investment efficiency, parties transacting in markets expect that they will trade with their contract partner or will make essentially the same transaction with another firm if the promisor breaches. Because the parties know that the contract deal will occur, one way or the other, parties invest efficiently to maximize deal value. In the specialized-goods case, on the other hand, because parties may be unable to observe or verify a counterparty’s investment actions, parties may choose privately efficient but socially inefficient investment levels. As an example, if it would be inefficient to trade a specialized good, the promisee would not make a similar deal elsewhere. Rather, the promisee would sue for its lost gain. Because the expectation-interest remedy insures that gain fully, the promisee may invest to maximize it rather than temper its investment to reflect the fact that, if the deal does not go through, its investment would have been wasted.

The naïve buyer maximizes v ( r ) -k -r , where k is the contract price, so it invests until v' ( r ) = 1. The sophisticated buyer recognizes that it will perform with probability p < 1,  so  it  maximizes p ( v ( r ) -k ) -r ,  where p is  the  probability  of  the  buyer's  own  performance.

38,"134.  This  technical  note  establishes  the  conclusion  in  text.  Recall  that  we  are  considering relation-specific investment with bilateral uncertainty. See supra note 129. Hence, both the buyer and the seller have incentives to take the possibility of their own defection into account. The buyer's uncertainty implies that his value is v ( r )  with  probability p < 1 and zero otherwise. The seller's uncertainty implies that her cost is c ( s ) < v ( r ) with probability q < 1, which implies that its cost is c > v ( r )  with probability 1 q .  The buyer's investment program, which is identical to the social planner's program, should solve pq ( v ( r ) -k ) -r . The socially optimal relation-specific investment, r* , is then determined by the first-order condition (FOC): v' ( r ) = 1/ pq . Under expectation damages, the  buyer  maximizes pq ( v ( r ) -k )  + p (1 q )( v ( r ) -k )  -  (1 p ) q ( k -c )  -r so  the  equilibrium investment, r ed , is determined by the FOC: v' ( r ) = 1/ p , from which we have r ed > r* by the concavity of v ( r ).  Under  reliance  damages,  by  contrast,  the  buyer  maximizes pq ( v ( r ) -k )  + p (1 q )( r )  -(1 p ) q ( s )  -r ,  where s is  the  seller's  specific  investment.  The  equilibrium  investment, r rd ,  is determined by the FOC: v' ( r ) = (1 p + pq )/ pq . Because 1/ pq > (1 p + pq )/ pq , by the concavity of v ( r ),  we  have r rd > r*. Under  the  reliance  remedy,  there  is  still  overinvestment.  But  because (1 p + pq )/ pq > 1/ p , also by  the  concavity  of v ( r ),  we  have r ed > r rd ,  which  means  that overinvestment is lower under the reliance remedy than under the expectation remedy.

As a result, an important segment of the U.S. economy functions today without a contract law.

Collaborations performed well in the extraordinary circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. But an implication of contract law’s absence is that the American economy underproduces productive collaborations in ordinary times.

42,A. Encouraging Participation,section_header,body_text,"At stage (i), parties face substantial uncertainty about whether a project will come to fruition, and each party often lacks hard information about a possible counterparty’s abilities and commitment. The state’s principal concern at this stage should be to induce parties to participate in potentially profitable arrangements. We suggest that reliance should be the default remedy when parties begin a transaction but one of them inappropriately defects. There are two reasons for this suggestion. First, as just stated, an expectation remedy may be impossible to implement when the variables on which it conditions are unknown. The second reason is more subtle: expectation damages, if a party could prove them, exceed reliance damages because parties expect a transaction’s gain to exceed its costs. However, when both parties are highly uncertain about whether a deal will come to fruition but are certain that they will incur substantial costs in finding out, they often prefer being insured against the nontrivial probability that exploratory costs will be wasted to being insured against the much lower probability of not realizing expectation gains. Thus, a reliance remedy is often more likely to encourage participation in a new-economy collaboration than the expectation remedy, even when an expectation is provable.

Doctrinally,  the expectation interest is awarded for breach of a complete contract, but at the initial  stage there isn't a complete contract. And as a practical matter, the compliant party seldom could prove the gain it would have realized under a framework agreement that the parties had not implemented. Nevertheless, a comparison of the two remedies has heuristic value because an important implication follows from the result.

44,"1.  Reliance at the Pivot Stage .-We begin with the buyer's problem. 149 Using the notation in the footnotes above concerning bilateral uncertainty 150 and letting the buyer's next best opportunity equal zero, the reliance remedy is  more  likely  to  satisfy  the  buyer's  participation  constraint  when  the following inequality holds 151 : p /(1 p )( ΠB -r F )  ≤ q /(1 q )( ΠS -s F ).  This complex  expression  captures  a  simple  intuition.  The  probability  that  the buyer will want to collaborate is p , and the adjacent term in parenthesis is the buyer's expected gain from collaborating: its profit ( ΠB )  less  exploratory costs ( r F ). Thus, the left-hand side of the inequality represents the insurance value the expectation remedy creates for the buyer: the value to the buyer of the seller insuring it if the seller breaches. The probability that the seller will want to collaborate is q , and the term in parenthesis is the seller's expected gain from collaborating: its profit ( ΠS ) less exploratory costs ( s F ). Thus, the right-hand side is the insurance value the expectation remedy creates for the seller: the value to the seller of the buyer insuring it if the buyer breaches. The inequality thus says that the buyer prefers reliance when the expected value of the seller insuring the buyer is lower than the expected cost of the buyer insuring the seller.",text,footnote,,.

Parties divide the contract surplus by choosing the price, k ; hence, v -k is the buyer's surplus and k -c is the seller's surplus. The contract surplus thus is v -c : value less cost. When the parties' bargaining power is equal, they split the surplus equally: Π B = Π S = ( v -c )/2.",footnote,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched
44,"151.  This technical note explains how we derived the inequality in the text. When the buyer's outside  option  is  set  to  zero,  the  buyer's  expected  return-which  determines  his  willingness  to participate  in  the  transaction-under  expectation  damages  is pq ( v -k )  + p (1 q )( v -k ) -(1 p ) q ( k -c )  -r F .  The  buyer's  expected  return  under  reliance  is pq ( v -k )  + p (1 q ) r F -(1 p ) q ( s F )  -r F .  Reliance  damages  provide  a  greater  incentive  to  participate  than  expectation damages  when p (1 q ) r F -  (1 p ) q ( s F )  > p (1 q )( v -k )  -  (1 p ) q ( k -c ).  Rearranging  this expression yields the inequality in the text. The reader can also check that the seller's condition that makes it prefer reliance is satisfied when q /(1 q )( Π B -s F ) ≤ p (1 p )( Π B -r F ) holds. Exploratoryspecific investments for new collaborations are both fixed and continuous. One can define a fixed investment as the lower bound of a continuous investment, but it is more illuminating to regard fixed investments as necessary for the buyer (Firm A) and the seller (Firm B) to make in order to begin operations. A continuous investment increases the contract surplus once the relationship has begun. Note, however, that because damages are a zero-sum game-increasing one party's damage payoff reduces the other party's payoff-the buyer's and seller's conditions for preferring reliance over expectation damages sometimes cannot be satisfied simultaneously.",text,footnote,,.

The result that 'reliance insurance' can create a stronger  incentive  for  a  party  to  make  exploratory  investments  than 'expectation  insurance'  is  prelude  to  the  determinative  question:  can  the reliance remedy satisfy both parties' participation constraints simultaneously?

Allocative  and  Distributive  Effects .-A firm is  risk-averse  when  it considers risk when deciding whether to make a contract. 153 Firms act as if they are risk-averse when the firms are undiversified-that is, when a firm is committing a non-negligible share of capital to a particular venture. 154 Riskaverse parties prefer full insurance, which would imply that undiversified parties  prefer  the  expectation  remedy.  On  the  other  hand,  and  as  the inequality above showed, even a risk-averse party may prefer not to insure its  counterparty  fully:  the  benefit  the  risk-averse  party  receives  from  the higher insurance that expectation damages provide could be lower than the cost  the  expectation  remedy  would  impose  on  the  risk-averse  party  if  it defects. The less risk-averse a party is, the more likely it will be that the cost of  fully  insuring  the  counterparty  would  outweigh  the  gain  from  the counterparty insuring it.

Midstream  Reformation  and  Asymmetric  Information  about  Court Types .-Parties  sometimes  will  have  different  beliefs  about  how  a  court would  interpret  their  framework  agreement.  These  beliefs  could  cause  a renegotiation  to  fail  even  when  the  parties  have  little  private  information about each other. 173 Midstream reformation permits the court to propose a forward-looking  assessment  of  the  parties'  arrangement  that  removes uncertainty  about  the  parties'  legal  rights  and  about  the  court's  type,  and therefore also facilitates Coasean bargaining. 174 For example, the court could construe the framework agreement to reassure the buyer that the seller will not be able opportunistically to exploit disclosed information (e.g., inserting an implied noncompetition duty), thereby inducing the buyer to truthfully reveal information. Further, such reformation would occur on the equilibrium path.",text,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched
53,"173.  We consider this cause of bargaining failure in greater detail elsewhere. See Schwartz & Sepe, supra note 104 (manuscript at 18-23) (discussing how bargaining failure arises). Indeed, when the parties have different beliefs on the court's 'type'-(i) the evidence a court will admit (and the weight the court will give to the evidence); (ii) the inferences a court will draw from the evidence; and (iii) how a court will apply contract law to the evidence-we show they might end up  litigating  an  agreement,  although  they  are  symmetrically  informed  about  payoff  of  relevant variables and there are gains to share from renegotiation. Id. (manuscript at 20-22). To solve this problem, we suggest a novel interpretive procedure that applies to a wide variety of legal areas, including new collaborations. Parties should be able to obtain an 'interim contract interpretation'that is, a judicial interpretation of their contract at the renegotiation stage rather than after a breach occurs. Id. (manuscript at 26). A midstream interpretation, in the form of a declaratory judgment or a new reformation remedy, would permit parties to align their beliefs on the expected litigation payoffs and therefore to continue an arrangement they would otherwise inefficiently terminate, or efficiently terminate a relationship without bearing unnecessary performance or litigation costs.

Framework agreements sometimes create consensus committees staffed by both parties that permit each party to veto significant actions of the other. 175 Suppose that the buyer in our example proposes to take actions that would be productive if the seller made an F 3 machine. The seller believes, to the contrary, that an F 4 machine  would  be  better  for  both  parties  and  thus  vetoes  the  buyer's proposed actions. Rather than give up, a buyer today may reveal additional private information showing why F 3 would maximize expected surplus. This possibility  suggests  that  parties  create  consensus  committees  to  serve  as information-forcing or mediation devices to induce a party to disclose the basis for a proposed deviation, rather than abandon the deviation or breach.

A trial would be pointless when parties know what is efficient for them to do. Further, as said, parties would often disclose rather than sue. Thus, unlike the standard interpretation-afterbreach case, a court would seldom have occasion to rule on what the contract means.

60,Conclusion,text,footnote,,". This note establishes the conclusion in text using the same notation as in supra note 129. The naïve buyer maximizes v ( r ) – k – r , where k is the contract price, so it invests until v’ ( r ) = 1. The sophisticated buyer recognizes that it will perform with probability p < 1, so it maximizes p ( v ( r ) – k ) – r , where p is the probability of the buyer’s own performance. Thus, the buyer will invest until p ( v’’ ( r )) = 1, which is less than the naïve buyer. It would be socially efficient, however, for the buyer to consider the actual likelihood of the deal going through, which is the joint probability— pq —that both parties will prefer performance, where q is the probability the seller will want to perform. The efficient buyer thus maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) – r . The efficient level of investment, r* , therefore solves pq ( v’ ( r )) = 1. Because pq is less than p , the sophisticated buyer invests more than the efficient buyer would invest.",100.0,matched

Today, however, contract law only protects reliance on a counterparty's enforceable promise. Because there is no such promise at the start, the prospect of incurring large, uncompensated costs probably deters participation. Thus, reliance should be the default remedy at the initial stage.

The parties agreed to share information, [7] to work together through the anticipated multi-year project, and to use a dispute-resolution system that required senior management of both companies to resolve difficulties jointly. [8] The arrangement focused on a particular compound—parathyroid hormone (PTH)—as an initial vehicle. [9] If the collaboration was successful, Eli Lilly would market a pill using PTH. Otherwise, Lilly had no right “to use the Emisphere Technology or Emisphere Program Technology other than insofar as they relate directly to the Field [i.e., the project] and are expressly granted herein.” [10] After several years, the arrangement broke down before the parties developed a pill to deliver PTH.

Prices are convenient for courts to observe; cost and value are sometimes not. The expectation remedy therefore facilitates exchange efficiency best in developed markets in which goods trade at their market prices. [26] Contract law also protects investment efficiency in developed markets because the disappointed promisee can resell to or repurchase from another market participant.

First, the prohibition against penalties should be relaxed so that courts enforce framework-agreement sanctions.

Traditional contract interpretation occurs after a breach, while the “midstream” reformation we propose would prevent breach by permitting a court to adapt the parties’ contractual mechanism to changing circumstances. [34] Finally, cooperation may fail even when parties hold consistent beliefs. For example, a party’s outside option may improve so that defection becomes more attractive.

But because the scholarly focus has been on how collaborations succeed, little attention has been paid to the question of how collaborations fail. Deal failure, however, is an ever-present possibility, [40] and it is the possibility on which lawyers should focus.

The arrangements then implement these norms with a relationship-management process. [74] Guiding principles lay the foundation of trust, while parties intend the relationship-management process to ensure that the parties’ expectations and interests remain aligned over time. The process also details how the partners should approach unforeseen circumstances as they arise.

[87] In response, Apple moved some of its business from Foxconn to Pegatron, another Taiwanese manufacturing company.

At the end of this stage, each party decides whether to move to the “implementation stage,” in which production takes place: goods or intellectual property are developed and produced, and perhaps prototypes for further production are created. During this stage, work statements are continuously revised by each collaborator’s team to update the terms of collaboration vis-à-vis new circumstances (i.e., both solved uncertainty and novel uncertainty).

The “interaction problem” is how to induce parties to cooperate during the implementation stage: to share information, to work as anticipated, and to update the framework agreement itself if needed.

[98] Firm B, instead, believes that the request of the Firm A’s engineers to enter B’s factory is motivated by unjustified mistrust. Firm B has met all prior quality-control tests and its engineers doubt the need for further controls. Further, Firm B anticipates that it is too costly for Firm A to terminate the arrangement at this stage and switch to another service provider, so Firm B can insist on its rights. The type of dispute this scenario exhibits is an example of the interaction problem. [99]",,0,html_body_unmatched

The ability to switch is why the literature recognizes framework arrangements to be flexible and to provide a playbook for parties’ future interactions.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This example, however, raises coordination and contracting problems. For example, Firm B might think that Firm A wants to modify the initial arrangement to recapture benefits at its expense (e.g., intranet access might help Firm A to gather information on Firm B that Firm A could use to obtain more favorable terms). Even if the initial arrangement explicitly provides that the parties would approach disagreements fairly, Firm B may be intransigent if it believes that switching costs would deter Firm A from finding a different partner. On the other hand, if Firm B refuses to modify the initial arrangement, Firm A may infer that Firm B is hiding a serious problem; this belief could cause the parties to escalate their conflict.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Courts face a difficult interpretative problem when an arrangement breaks down over such disagreements. Framework agreements, just because they flexibly permit adjustments, may not provide clear answers to disagreements. Regarding : terms that address disagreements, Bernstein and Peterson note: “ all are vague about what happens when the [parties] cannot come to an agreement.” [103] Courts therefore must infer efficient solutions to mid-stream disputes from an open agreement, the parties’ behavior, and the context. Interpreting framework arrangements thus poses a challenge to current theories of contract interpretation. [104]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"If a collaboration succeeds, there will be a new, potentially profitable product. The parties’ task at this stage is to allocate rights and duties between them in order to market the product efficiently. For example, one party may agree to produce the product while the other may agree to market it. [105] Contracting at this stage may be challenging if residual asymmetric information persists. Thus, one party may have learned its partner’s development cost but not its production cost, while the partner may know little about concrete marketing opportunities. They will need to overcome these uncertainties in order to create a final contract.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Turning to remedies, the principal contract law remedy is the expectation interest. [110] This remedy facilitates exchange efficiency—the efficient trade—because it requires a promisor to bear the expectation loss that breach would impose on the promisee. As a consequence, the promisor will breach only when performance of the contract would have been inefficient—that is, when the promisor’s loss from performance would have exceeded the promisee’s expected gain. A promisor, however, may breach inefficiently if the promisee could not verify its expectation to a court. The expectation remedy thus facilitates exchange efficiency when verification is convenient. This condition is satisfied, we show, when parties make market transactions . Markets produce information about values and costs that is inexpensive for parties to observe and to verify. In contrast, when a contract requires the seller to produce specialized goods for the buyer, the parties must be able to verify values or costs in order to establish the consequences of breach.—Three supplementary remedies—reliance damages, specific performance, and the liquidated-damage clause—are partial substitutes when the expectation remedy itself cannot yield exchange efficiency.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Again, we consider how contract remedies affect exchange and investment efficiency. Beginning with exchange efficiency, we consider three cases: (i) the seller produced the goods but the buyer wrongfully rejects them; (ii) the seller produced the goods but prefers to sell them to a later-appearing buyer; and (iii) the seller has not produced the goods but prefers breach because the seller recognizes that its realized cost would exceed the contract price. Alternatively, the buyer prefers breach because it recognizes that the price would exceed its realized value. [120]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"All three investment pathologies are a serious concern for new-economy collaborations. There, as Part I showed, parties make exploratory investments in order to see whether a collaboration is possible and to prepare to perform, and they make substantive investments to implement the collaboration. [132] Parties must make both investments before the parties have a legally enforceable contract. Thus, the risks of holdup and underinvestment commonly attend new-economy collaborations. Overinvestment is a concern at the last stage if parties have made a contract to exploit a product they have developed. The expectation remedy may be apt here, so the overinvestment result it induces can occur. Before seeing how new remedies could efficiently respond to these pathologies, we consider two current remedies that can outperform the expectation in information-poor environments: reliance and liquidated damages.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A liquidated-damage clause (LDC) is a contractual transfer the promisor must make to the promisee if the promisor breaches. [136] The LDC induces exchange efficiency when the transfer approximates the buyer’s expectation because then the seller will make the transfer only if its loss from performance would exceed the promisee’s loss from breach. An LDC that turns out to vary widely from the promisee’s expectation, however, can induce an inefficient trade—the transfer it requires is too high—or an inefficient breach—the transfer is too low.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Contract remedies are mandatory, but the remedies that Part II showed are efficient would be good defaults if parties could contract freely. Parties would accept a default rule that required the promisor to pay market damages and would accept the standard expectation-interest remedy when values and costs are observable. [141] When the efficiency conditions for the reliance remedy, traditional specific performance, or liquidated damages are satisfied, parties would make reliance, specific performance, or liquidated damages contracts as well. Therefore, when a court orders a reluctant promisor to transfer the difference between contract and market prices, the promisee’s value, the goods themselves, or a contractually specified sum, the court is specifically enforcing the contract that parties prefer. The interpretation and gap-filling functions of courts complete this promissory scheme. A court’s interpretation clarifies the description of the contract’s subject. A court fills a gap with a term that the court believes would advance the parties’ goal. [142] The court then enforces the clarified or supplemented contract with remedies, it believes, most parties would choose.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In contrast, when a party to a collaborative contract defects at the beginning or middle stages, the framework agreement cannot specify a concluding step. Rather, defection prevents the parties from moving to the next stage. Therefore, a court necessarily must play a different role as regards new-economy collaborations. As we show, the court’s choice is either to withdraw or to become part of the parties’ mechanism. The court’s role, that is, should shift from enforcing a final contract to coordinating the parties’ behavior. [144] Coordination can have an epistemic function—to align parties’ beliefs in light of their current information—or a control function—to require parties to comply with their framework agreement’s procedures. The goal of both strategies should be to facilitate parties’ ability to continue efficient projects that asymmetric information would otherwise have caused them to end.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The question we take up is whether a court’s best response to holdup should protect the compliant party’s expectation interest or its reliance interest. To be sure, this seldom would be a real choice. Doctrinally, the expectation interest is awarded for breach of a complete contract, but at the initial stage there isn’t a complete contract. And as a practical matter, the compliant party seldom could prove the gain it would have realized under a framework agreement that the parties had not implemented. Nevertheless, a comparison of the two remedies has heuristic value because an important implication follows from the result. Contract law, “in the light of . . . the difficulties of proof of loss,” enforces a liquidated-damage clause that plausibly estimates the promisee’s expectation. [146] Because the expectation is the remedy the law permits, a contractually required transfer that approximates the expectation is enforceable. Because reliance is not the remedy the law permits—there must be an enforceable promise—a contractually required transfer that approximates reliance is not enforceable. [147] Suppose, however, that the expectation usually is too difficult to prove at the initial stage and that reliance damages sometimes are efficient. It should then follow that a contractually required transfer that approximates reliance should also be enforceable.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"We begin with the buyer’s problem. [149] Using the notation in the footnotes above concerning bilateral uncertainty [150] and letting the buyer’s next best opportunity equal zero, the reliance remedy is more likely to satisfy the buyer’s participation constraint when the following inequality holds [151] : p /(1 – p )( ΠB – r F ) ≤ q /(1 – q )( ΠS – s F ). This complex expression captures a simple intuition. The probability that the buyer will want to collaborate is p , and the adjacent term in parenthesis is the buyer’s expected gain from collaborating: its profit ( ΠB ) less exploratory costs ( r F ). Thus, the left-hand side of the inequality represents the insurance value the expectation remedy creates for the buyer: the value to the buyer of the seller insuring it if the seller breaches. The probability that the seller will want to collaborate is q , and the term in parenthesis is the seller’s expected gain from collaborating: its profit ( ΠS ) less exploratory costs ( s F ). Thus, the right-hand side is the insurance value the expectation remedy creates for the seller: the value to the seller of the buyer insuring it if the buyer breaches. The inequality thus says that the buyer prefers reliance when the expected value of the seller insuring the buyer is lower than the expected cost of the buyer insuring the seller.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The left-hand side of the inequality becomes smaller as the probability that the buyer will prefer to collaborate— p —is smaller; [152] and as the buyer’s exploratory costs— r F —increase. Thus, the buyer is more likely to prefer a reliance remedy when it believes that success is a long shot but it will cost the buyer a lot to find out. The result that “reliance insurance” can create a stronger incentive for a party to make exploratory investments than “expectation insurance” is prelude to the determinative question: can the reliance remedy satisfy both parties’ participation constraints simultaneously? We consider two common cases when both parties would prefer reliance: if one party is risk-averse and if the parties’ bargaining power is unequal.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A firm is risk-averse when it considers risk when deciding whether to make a contract. [153] Firms act as if they are risk-averse when the firms are undiversified—that is, when a firm is committing a non-negligible share of capital to a particular venture. [154] Risk-averse parties prefer full insurance, which would imply that undiversified parties prefer the expectation remedy. On the other hand, and as the inequality above showed, even a risk-averse party may prefer not to insure its counterparty fully: the benefit the risk-averse party receives from the higher insurance that expectation damages provide could be lower than the cost the expectation remedy would impose on the risk-averse party if it defects. The less risk-averse a party is, the more likely it will be that the cost of fully insuring the counterparty would outweigh the gain from the counterparty insuring it. To see what follows, let the seller be mildly risk-averse and the buyer be risk-neutral. Then, if the buyer prefers reliance, the reliance remedy would satisfy both parties’ participation constraints jointly because a mildly risk-averse seller would prefer low-cost reliance insurance.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The buyer’s expected value from the contract would be 10.5, [156] but the startup’s expected value would be –4.5.

Were reliance the remedy, in contrast, the buyer’s expected value from the contract would fall to 5.5, [158] but the seller’s expected value would increase to 0.5.

We summarize these reasons under the heading “asymmetric information” because commercial parties commonly reason to the same result when they observe the same data. In this subsection, we make the asymmetric-information explanation for inefficient breakups more precise and argue that a modified reformation remedy would reduce them.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The buyer produces intermediate goods: products that the buyer sells to end users. The buyer believes that a potential seller–maker could produce a machine that would be compatible with the buyer’s existing factory setup and would increase output efficiently. Because such a machine is yet to exist, the buyer recognizes that it could come in various versions, each of which would affect the buyer’s return differently. We denote the buyer’s use of possible versions as buyer “types.” The set of such types is X i , where i can take on any value from one to infinity. For example, we write a buyer’s use of a possible type three machine as type X 3 . Importantly, each type is multidimensional. Thus, an X 3 machine would run at a certain rate, require servicing at particular intervals, need particular safety devices, and so on. An X 4 machine also might contribute to the buyer’s return but would differ along some or all of these dimensions.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Each possible machine function also is multidimensional. Thus, a particular machine version— F 3 —could cut steel to certain thicknesses, configure the steel in various shapes, take two employees to operate, require particular safety devices, and so on.

Thus, β —the measure of the seller’s private information—has materially shrunk. [169] The now well-informed buyer believes that the seller could produce a machine with functions that would suit the buyer’s preferred attributes.

[174] For example, the court could construe the framework agreement to reassure the buyer that the seller will not be able opportunistically to exploit disclosed information (e.g., inserting an implied noncompetition duty), thereby inducing the buyer to truthfully reveal information. Further, such reformation would occur on the equilibrium path.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The seller believes, to the contrary, that an F 4 machine would be better for both parties and thus vetoes the buyer’s proposed actions. Rather than give up, a buyer today may reveal additional private information showing why F 3 would maximize expected surplus. This possibility suggests that parties create consensus committees to serve as information-forcing or mediation devices to induce a party to disclose the basis for a proposed deviation, rather than abandon the deviation or breach. The availability of a reformation action would usefully supplement the consensus committee.",,0,html_body_unmatched

A trial would be pointless when parties know what is efficient for them to do. Further, as said, parties would often disclose rather than sue. Thus, unlike the standard interpretation-after-breach case, a court would seldom have occasion to rule on what the contract means. In addition, parties concerned about over-reaching courts could contract out of the interim interpretation remedy.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Finally, we note that courts today are willing to issue injunctions that require adherence to pre-specified procedures in more complex environments than the typical new-economy collaboration. Courts now supervise schools, prisons, hospitals, probate and bankruptcy estates, and elections to ensure the protection of public and private rights. [180] The literature on equitable remedies thus observes that an equity court’s “first-order policy problem” is to identify the relevant right. [181] Then, using its “equitable managerial devices,” the court attempts to solve the “second-order policy problem[] . . . to manage compliance and constrain abuse.” [182] A more recent description of this process—courts using injunctions to vindicate rights—shows that courts “focus[] largely on governance and accountability structures rather than mandat[ing] specific practices. . . . [Courts] typically issue decrees that focus on broad issues of governance and accountability reflected in frameworks negotiated by the parties . ” [183] In sum, a midstream specific-performance remedy would increase the parties’ ability to implement framework agreements and would be consistent with widely accepted views of the judicial function. [184]",,0,html_body_unmatched

[185] Under the game, each party announces a value for the right to market the product: v A for Firm A; v B for Firm B. The party whose announced value is highest gets the right but must pay the losing party its announced value. Because information is private, a party could not verify the truth of its counterparty’s announcement. Now consider Firm A’s strategy. If Firm A exaggerates its value, it may win but it would have to pay v B to Firm B. The value v B may exceed Firm A’s true value, however. On the other hand, if Firm A underreports its true value, it may lose and receive its announced value v A , but its true value may have been higher than the value Firm B announced. Hence, Firm A will make a truthful announcement. Because Firm B has the same incentives, it will report truthfully as well.

Note that the winner receives all of the surplus—its value less marketing cost—and so will market the product efficiently.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The remedies we recommend—reliance, reformation, and injunction—should be defaults. There are two reasons. First, framework agreements differ materially from traditional contracts. The traditional-economy contract permits parties to specify their obligations precisely. Precise specifications necessarily constrain the judicial role largely to requiring a promisor to complete the contract. In contrast, collaborative framework agreements preclude precise specifications—except for process—because a collaboration is a work in progress at the early and middle stages. Parties at these stages seldom know which substantive obligations would later facilitate marketing the finished product. The looseness of framework agreements, in turn, creates opportunities for courts to become part of the parties’ mechanism—that is, to enhance the parties’ ability to continue efficient collaborations. But parties know best how much help they need. Hence, parties should be able to accept or reject a court’s help by accepting or contracting out of the remedies we propose.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The agreements that govern these collaborations are not contracts in the traditional sense.

Production that once occurred entirely within a firm therefore is conducted by two or more firms in accordance with these contractually created processes.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In the traditional economy, production preceded trade, and trade commonly occurred at one stage: the seller tendered, and the buyer paid. The key to developing new-economy remedies, we argue, is for courts to recognize that production proceeds in stages, and trade occurs, if at all, at the end. Remedies for the new contracts thus should be stage-relevant—that is, the remedies should be facilitate the objectives and take into account the parties’ incentives to defect at each stage. [198]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"At the beginning, the law should encourage parties to participate in the new collaborations. The expectation remedy cannot play the facilitative role it plays in the traditional economy for two reasons. Initially, the remedy conditions on prices, costs, and values, but these variables seldom have content early on. In addition, the reliance remedy can create greater incentives for parties to participate than the expectation remedy, even if parties could prove an expectation. A prospective party to a new-economy collaboration knows that success is uncertain, but it must incur sunk exploratory and startup costs. The insurance against a counterparty’s breach that the expectation remedy provides thus could have a lower expected payoff than the reliance remedy, although an expectation payoff likely would exceed costs. Today, however, contract law only protects reliance on a counterparty’s enforceable promise. Because there is no such promise at the start, the prospect of incurring large, uncompensated costs probably deters participation. Thus, reliance should be the default remedy at the initial stage. Further, courts should enforce a liquidated damage that is not intended to replicate the expectation, but rather to replicate reliance costs. [199]",,0,html_body_unmatched

See Jean-Jacques Laffont, A Brief Overview of the Economics of Incomplete Markets , 65 Econ. Rec. 54, 55 (1989) (explaining that economic theory has not considered people’s inability to know the future or to conceive of some events). Projections of predictable events are impaired by “bounded rationality,” which are limits on the ability to calculate optimal strategies. See John Geanakoplos, An Introduction to General Equilibrium with Incomplete Asset Markets , 19 J. Mathematical Econ. 1, 2 n.1 (1990) (“[One] reason that asset markets are incomplete has to do with the bounded rationality of the agents. It is impossible to think of all the future contingencies it would be necessary to specify to have complete asset markets.”). Note that bounded rationality is different from irrationality, under which the agents in the economy make systematic mistakes and cannot exactly anticipate the central moment of distributions. Conversely, under bounded rationality, the agents are rational but have computational limitations. Bounded rationality is one of the working assumptions of the literature of incomplete markets. See Michael Magill & Martine Quinzii , 1 Theory of Incomplete Markets 12–13 (1996) (identifying bounded rationality as one of the axioms on which transactions-cost literature is based).",0,html_footnote_unmatched

Oliver Williamson characterized this difference as a fundamental transformation—from competition ex ante to bilateral monopoly ex post . See, e.g. , Oliver E. Williamson, Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations , 22 J.L. & Econ . 233, 241 (1979) (describing idiosyncratic transactions in which the relationship between the buyer and seller transforms from competition before the transaction to bilateral monopoly afterwards because of transaction-specific costs).",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,". This technical note establishes the conclusion in text. Recall that we are considering relation-specific investment with bilateral uncertainty. See supra note 129. Hence, both the buyer and the seller have incentives to take the possibility of their own defection into account. The buyer’s uncertainty implies that his value is v ( r ) with probability p < 1 and zero otherwise. The seller’s uncertainty implies that her cost is c ( s ) < v ( r ) with probability q < 1, which implies that its cost is c > v ( r ) with probability 1 – q . The buyer’s investment program, which is identical to the social planner’s program, should solve pq ( v ( r ) – k ) – r . The socially optimal relation-specific investment, r* , is then determined by the first-order condition (FOC): v’ ( r ) = 1/ pq . Under expectation damages, the buyer maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) + p (1 – q )( v ( r ) – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ) – r so the equilibrium investment, r ed , is determined by the FOC: v’ ( r ) = 1/ p , from which we have r ed > r* by the concavity of v ( r ). Under reliance damages, by contrast, the buyer maximizes pq ( v ( r ) – k ) + p (1 – q )( r ) – (1 – p ) q ( s ) – r , where s is the seller’s specific investment. The equilibrium investment, r rd , is determined by the FOC: v’ ( r ) = (1 – p + pq )/ pq . Because 1/ pq > (1 – p + pq )/ pq , by the concavity of v ( r ), we have r rd > r*. Under the reliance remedy, there is still overinvestment. But because (1 – p + pq )/ pq > 1/ p , also by the concavity of v ( r ), we have r ed > r rd , which means that overinvestment is lower under the reliance remedy than under the expectation remedy. A similar argument applies for the seller.",0,html_footnote_unmatched

,,,,,". Id. In some industries, parties use open-price long-term contracts, which require the buyer to purchase goods and authorize the seller to set prices. Courts can enforce these contracts because the seller’s behavior is regulated for good faith and reasonableness under U.C.C. § 2-305 (Am. L. Inst. & Nat’l Conf. of Comm’rs on Unif. State L. 2021) .

Mathematical Econ. 67 (1974) (exploring how the use of correlated strategies in a noncooperative game can achieve equilibrium). A technical discussion would be out of place, but the basic intuition is simple. Players’ choices of strategies (e.g., to cooperate or not cooperate) may be correlated when the players condition on the same random events to decide which strategy to play. Now consider a game that includes an “observer” (e.g., a court) whose task is to recommend a strategy to each player. The observer will recommend a subset of strategies according to a probability distribution over the set of possible strategies, which the players commonly know. This probability distribution is called a correlated equilibrium if the strategy vector in which all players follow the observer’s recommendations is a Nash equilibrium—that is, if following the recommendations is the best response (the most efficient action) each player can take.",0,html_footnote_unmatched

Several scholars have argued that the liquidated-damage rules should be repealed; courts should not review contractually required transfers at all, subject to the constraints of fraud, unconscionability, and other forms of overreaching.

Goetz & Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties and the Just Compensation Principle: Some Notes on an Enforcement Model and a Theory of Efficient Breach , 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554, 557 (1977) (hypothesizing that “absent evidence of process unfairness in bargaining, efficiency will be enhanced by the enforcement of an agreed allocation of risks embodied in a liquidated damage clause”). Because the practice of judicial review is likely to remain, we argue here that courts should enforce contractual transfers that reflect a reasonable estimate of exploratory and startup costs.",0,html_footnote_unmatched

,,,,,". See supra notes 129, 130, 134. We assume now for convenience that parties have equal bargaining power. We relax this assumption below. See infra section IV(A)(2). Parties divide the contract surplus by choosing the price, k ; hence, v – k is the buyer’s surplus and k – c is the seller’s surplus. The contract surplus thus is v – c : value less cost. When the parties’ bargaining power is equal, they split the surplus equally: Π B = Π S = ( v – c )/2.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,". This technical note explains how we derived the inequality in the text. When the buyer’s outside option is set to zero, the buyer’s expected return—which determines his willingness to participate in the transaction—under expectation damages is pq ( v – k ) + p (1 – q )( v – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ) – r F . The buyer’s expected return under reliance is pq ( v – k ) + p (1 – q ) r F – (1 – p ) q ( s F ) – r F . Reliance damages provide a greater incentive to participate than expectation damages when p (1 – q ) r F – (1 – p ) q ( s F ) > p (1 – q )( v – k ) – (1 – p ) q ( k – c ). Rearranging this expression yields the inequality in the text. The reader can also check that the seller’s condition that makes it prefer reliance is satisfied when q /(1 – q )( Π B – s F ) ≤ p (1 – p )( Π B – r F ) holds. Exploratory-specific investments for new collaborations are both fixed and continuous. One can define a fixed investment as the lower bound of a continuous investment, but it is more illuminating to regard fixed investments as necessary for the buyer (Firm A) and the seller (Firm B) to make in order to begin operations. A continuous investment increases the contract surplus once the relationship has begun. Note, however, that because damages are a zero-sum game—increasing one party’s damage payoff reduces the other party’s payoff—the buyer’s and seller’s conditions for preferring reliance over expectation damages sometimes cannot be satisfied simultaneously.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,". The left-hand side expression— p /(1 – p )—is the buyer’s odds ratio: the ratio of the number of events that produce an outcome to the number of events that do not (i.e., if p is 50%, the odds ratio is 1; if p is 20%, the odds ratio is 1/4). Hence, the smaller p is, the smaller the left-hand side of the inequality is.",0,html_footnote_unmatched

See also Burton, supra note 145, at 102 (“To get reformation, the party seeking it must prove that, unknown to either party, their true agreement differed materially from the written agreement. Examples are typographical and transcription errors, or the parties’ inattention to the writing .” (footnotes omitted)).",0,html_footnote_unmatched
,,,,,". We consider this cause of bargaining failure in greater detail elsewhere. See Schwartz & Sepe, supra note 104 (manuscript at 18–23) (discussing how bargaining failure arises). Indeed, when the parties have different beliefs on the court’s “type”—(i) the evidence a court will admit (and the weight the court will give to the evidence); (ii) the inferences a court will draw from the evidence; and (iii) how a court will apply contract law to the evidence—we show they might end up litigating an agreement, although they are symmetrically informed about payoff of relevant variables and there are gains to share from renegotiation. Id. (manuscript at 20–22). To solve this problem, we suggest a novel interpretive procedure that applies to a wide variety of legal areas, including new collaborations. Parties should be able to obtain an “interim contract interpretation”—that is, a judicial interpretation of their contract at the renegotiation stage rather than after a breach occurs. Id. (manuscript at 26). A midstream interpretation, in the form of a declaratory judgment or a new reformation remedy, would permit parties to align their beliefs on the expected litigation payoffs and therefore to continue an arrangement they would otherwise inefficiently terminate, or efficiently terminate a relationship without bearing unnecessary performance or litigation costs. See id. (manuscript at 26–28) (discussing interim contract interpretation and providing an illustration to show the effects of having interim interpretation as a remedy).",0,html_footnote_unmatched

Arbitration clauses in commercial contracts generally incorporate by reference the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, which expressly allow the arbitrator to grant specific performance of a contract, but are silent with regard to penalties, fines, or punitive damages. See Am. Arb. Ass’n, Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures R47(a) (2013) (“The arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties, including, but not limited to, specific performance of a contract .” (emphasis added)). Whether an arbitrator’s award of equitable remedies or punitive damages will be judicially enforceable, however, may depend on whether the arbitration is governed by state law or by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrators currently do not have the power to award punitive damages under New York law.
