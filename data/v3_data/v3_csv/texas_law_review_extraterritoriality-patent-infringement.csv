1,"Boundaries are a foundational characteristic of patent systems across the globe. However, the extent to which the territorial boundaries reach remains an open  question.  It  is  a  long-held  tenet  of  patent  law  that  patent  owners  may recover against infringers. But in considering patent damages and extraterritoriality, two basic principles of U.S. patent law are seemingly placed in  juxtaposition:  first,  that  patent  owners  are  entitled  to  full  recovery,  and second, that patent rights are fundamentally domestic in nature.",text,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched
1,"An extraterritorial application of law is the extension of a country's law to conduct outside the territorial confines of that country. Recently, the Federal Circuit considered a trilogy of cases addressing extraterritoriality in the context of patent damages. In these decisions, the Federal Circuit relied heavily on the presumption against extraterritoriality, emphasizing a rigid view of territoriality in determining damages for patent infringement. In all three of the cases, the court declined to award lost profits for foreign sales flowing from a domestic act of infringement.",text,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched
1,"Opening the aperture slightly, the Supreme Court held in 2018 that a patent owner can recover 'lost foreign profits' arising from an act of infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(f). Under this provision, a patentee may recover damages when  an  infringer  supplies  or  exports  components  of  a  patented  invention originating in the United States with the intent that the components be combined in  an  infringing  manner abroad. This Note considers the extent to which the Court's decision can be applied to infringement under other provisions, such as § 271(a), which defines direct infringement of a U.S. patent. Although various scholars have debated this topic, this Note extends beyond the current literature by exploring the impact of these judicial decisions on the U.S. semiconductor industry.  An  extension  of  patent  damages  would  augment  domestic  policy designed to stimulate U.S. competitiveness in the global semiconductor arena.",text,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched

[201] Surely conduct violating § 271(a), which explicitly states that the infringing acts must occur “within the United States,” would be even more domestic. Thus, under the Court’s own reasoning, domestic application of § 271(a) should be allowed in the context of foreign lost profits—if anything, the case for awarding extraterritorial damages is even stronger.

[8] In particular, the Court seems to have an interest in the intersection of patent law and extraterritoriality, [9] the same intersection explored at the heart of this Note. Extraterritorial application of law is “the competence of a State to apply its laws to foreign entities in relation to their, often purely foreign, conduct.” [10] Specifically, in the United States, this refers to “the extension of federal law to activity outside the territorial confines of the United States.” [11] Despite language in the Patent Act expressing territorial limits, [12] U.S. patent law has traditionally been extended outside of domestic contexts. [13] The question is: How far do the territorial boundaries reach?

[221] For instance, the act of domestic infringement must be the but-for cause of “any extraterritorial sales that allegedly harm the patent owner or benefit the infringer.” [222] And “even if the domestic infringement is the cause-in-fact of foreign sales, the patent owner cannot recover damages reflecting those sales unless the sales also are proximately caused by the domestic infringement.” [223] Thus, extension of WesternGeco II does not necessarily open the floodgates to a proliferation of patent damages.",,80.43478260869566,matched

After a competitor makes its own version of the patented tool, selling it to customers who use it in Texas and Louisiana,  the  patentee's  profits  drop  to  zero.  In  this  purely  domestic scenario,  the  patentee  would  be  entitled  to  $3  million  in  damages.  The scenario  becomes  more  complex  when  the  facts  are  changed  slightly  to consider foreign sales. If the patent owner instead uses her patented tool in Texas and France, the determination of damages becomes complicated by the Federal Circuit's strict extraterritorial limitations. The patent holder would still be entitled to the $2 million lost profits in Texas but would be unable to recover the $1 million lost profits in France. Thus, the net recovery (under the France scenario) is $2 million instead of the $3 million obtained from purely domestic lost profits. Yelderman notes:",text,footnote,,. Id.,100.0,matched

[24] Under this presumption, “[a]bsent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.” [25] Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption “applies with particular force in patent law” [26] and that “[o]ur patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect.” [27]",,0,html_body_unmatched

Incorporating the presumption against extraterritoriality, the first step determines “whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted—that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially.” [42] If such indication exists, then the presumption is overcome, and the statute is granted extraterritorial reach within the limits imposed by Congress.

For instance, a patentee can seek price erosion damages if it was forced to lower prices to remain competitive with the infringing product.

[152] Since § 271(f) regulates the act of exporting the components of patented inventions, foreign lost sales are likely foreseeable. [153] In fact, in order to be found liable under § 271(f), there almost has to be some foreign conduct involved. [154] By contrast, since the underlying infringement under § 271(a) is based on entirely domestic conduct, it is likely more difficult to establish a causal connection to foreign activity, including lost profits.

After a competitor makes its own version of the patented tool, selling it to customers who use it in Texas and Louisiana, the patentee’s profits drop to zero. In this purely domestic scenario, the patentee would be entitled to $3 million in damages. The scenario becomes more complex when the facts are changed slightly to consider foreign sales.

,,,,"In the United States, it is well-settled that patents are only directly infringed by conduct occurring inside the country’s geographic boundaries. However, the use of infringing chips to compete in the design win process satisfies this condition as an act of domestic infringement.
