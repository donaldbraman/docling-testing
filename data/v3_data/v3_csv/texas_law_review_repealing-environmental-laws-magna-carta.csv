1,Introduction,section_header,body_text,"Finally, the Court’s ruling in City of San Francisco provided the sequel to Sackett by seriously undercutting the Clean Water Act’s ability to ensure that state water quality standards are met by the nation’s industrial polluters. Congress in 1972 had carefully crafted a two-step approach to protecting the nation’s waters, first by insisting that industrial dischargers met strict and ambitious technology-based effluent reduction requirements. [120] And second, to guard against the possibility that such technology-based limitations would not be sufficient to protect some state waters, Congress insisted on a second layer of state water quality-based effluent limitations. [121] Congress was well aware of the challenges of having effluent limitations based solely on water quality. In City of San Francisco, however, the Court effectively decided that the same challenges that Congress had considered and resolved in the statute should be resolved in a different way, more forgiving to industry needs. The latter might or might not make good policy sense, but it had already been asked and answered differently by Congress. The Court majority, however, insisted on a somewhat stretched “textual” reading to rule against EPA. [122]",,83.33333333333334,matched

NEPA requires that federal agencies  prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for any proposals for 'major federal actions significantly affecting the quality  of  the  human  environment.' 18 There  was  no  dispute here that an EIS was required. There was the requisite federal agency (the  Surface  Transportation  Board).  That  agency  was proposing a major federal action (permitting the 88-mile extension of an existing freight rail line in Utah to facilitate development and production of waxy crude oil in the Uinta Basin -the geographic area to be served by that rail line). 19 And that railway line, if permitted, would result in significant adverse environmental effects. 20 There was similarly no dispute under established Supreme Court precedent that the EIS need not consider all the 'but for' adverse consequences of the proposed Board action to be adequate. 21",text,footnote,,.

A sufficient number of individual Justices had made their objections to Chevron known, 136 and the Court had not applied Chevron deference since 2016. 137 One Justice on the Court, Justice Gorsuch, had seemed even to campaign for a Supreme Court nomination based on his desire to overrule Chevron . 138 Since Justice Gorsuch had joined the Court, both West Virginia's Major Questions Doctrine and Sackett's invocation of multiple canons of statutory construction also left little room for Chevron.

Its determination of what facts are relevant can naturally be framed as turning  on  a  question  of  law,  including  the  meaning  of  statutory terms such as 'environmental effects' and 'detailed' in NEPA. For this reason, some may view Seven County as cutting back on Loper Bright , while others may view Seven County as simply making clear the longstanding distinction between judicial review of statutory interpretation under Chevron and judicial review of agency factual assessments under State Farm .",footnote,footnote,,.

,,,,"Case background . In many respects, Seven County was a straightforward NEPA case. NEPA requires that federal agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for any proposals for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” [18] There was no dispute here that an EIS was required. There was the requisite federal agency (the Surface Transportation Board). That agency was proposing a major federal action (permitting the 88-mile extension of an existing freight rail line in Utah to facilitate development and production of waxy crude oil in the Uinta Basin—the geographic area to be served by that rail line). [19] And that railway line, if permitted, would result in significant adverse environmental effects. [20] There was similarly no dispute under established Supreme Court precedent that the EIS need not consider all the “but for” adverse consequences of the proposed Board action to be adequate. [21]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,The issue raised by Seven County was whether the Board EIS had adequately considered the proposed action’s environmental effects. [22] The D.C. Circuit had ruled the Board had not.

,,,,"The but-for environmental effects of the proposed railway line range from the most immediate to the most distant in time and space. The most immediate effects included the construction and operation of the railroad itself bounded by its 88-mile length. That these effects were included was uncontested. [25] Less immediate effects—but effects with an obvious tie to the railroad project—included the adverse environmental effects caused by the increased oil production activities in the Uinta Basin area that the new railway line was designed to service. These are “upstream” consequences. [26] After all, the very purpose of the railway line was to promote that increased oil production activity. [27] Looking outside the geographic boundaries of the project, other possible adverse environmental effects would be to look “downstream” of the project to the increased railway traffic the new railway line might cause outside its own 88-mile length, including railway accidents and oil spills. [28] Finally, even further removed in time and space, the effects might include the increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by the refining of the crude oil once it reached its final destination hundreds of miles away in the Gulf States. [29]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Surface Transportation Board EIS considered impacts that the railway extension construction and operation would have on water resources, sage grouse, ambient levels of noise, and existing land uses. [30] The EIS considered some upstream consequences as well, including some of the impact of oil production where it would take place, and some downstream consequences, including whether there would be increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts from refining in the Gulf States. [31] The EIS also estimated the number of increased oil wells likely generated upstream by the railroad extension and some of the downstream consequences. [32] The Board held six public meetings on the project and received more than 1,900 comments on its Draft EIA. [33] The Board’s final EIS, when combined with supporting documentation, was more than 3,600 pages long.

[49] Nor was it an argument that was raised even by their petition for a writ of certiorari, [50] so it arguably was not even fairly before the Court. This categorical argument repeatedly relied on Congress’s 2023 amendment of NEPA―even though the amendment was made years after the EIS was completed―as making clear that Congress did not support the D.C.

Here, the respondents were arguing, and the D.C. Circuit had held, that an EIS related to an 88-mile railway line had failed to consider all the reasonably foreseeable consequences—when the Surface Transportation Board’s EIS was itself more than 600 pages long, and supplemented by almost 3,000 additional pages of appendices and responses to public comments.

Raimondo , [59] providing that judicial review of an agency interpretation of a statute is “de novo,” on the ground that here the Board was not interpreting a statute but was “exercis[ing] discretion . . . granted by a statute,” which was governed by the Administrative Procedure Act’s highly deferential “arbitrary and capricious” standard of judicial review. [60] The meaning of “detailed” in NEPA’s requirement that an EIS be a “detailed statement” may be a question of law, the Court reasoned, but how much “detail” must be in a particular EIS is a question of fact to which judicial deference to the agency’s assessment is warranted. [61]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,The Court also grounded its decision on its ruling that the lower “court incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the Board to consider environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place from the Uinta Basin Railway.” [64] The agency need consider “only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line.” [65],,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The practical impact on NEPA of the majority’s ruling is potentially enormous. Whether one thinks the Court was correct or incorrect on its legal ruling, it cannot be gainsaid that this is a sea change of what had long been settled NEPA law. To be sure, there had been lots of litigation of to what extent upstream and downstream consequences could be considered “reasonably foreseeable,” which all agreed was the governing legal touchstone. [70] And those debates had certainly intensified during the past decade when the issue extended to whether those upstream or downstream consequences extended to greenhouse gas emissions. [71] But no court, including the Supreme Court in any of its prior seventeen NEPA cases, had ever suggested that agencies basically had carte blanche to exclude all downstream and upstream effects in drawing “manageable” boundaries for what environmental effects an EIS must discuss.",,0,html_body_unmatched

They can be readily found to violate other statutory requirements that do have substantive bite on the agency’s decision, such as the federal Administrative Procedure Act. As has happened not infrequently, a court may strike down the federal agency action as arbitrary and capricious for failing to adequately consider the adverse environmental effects revealed, because of NEPA, in the administrative record before the agency.

[98] In 2023, in Sackett v.

[109] Based on its many years of experience administering fishing quotas, the agency concluded that what was needed to meet those quotas was to mandate that the Atlantic herring fishery fund the costs for on-board observers to monitor for possible violations. [110] Yet, by overturning Chevron , the Court ruled that the validity of the monitoring program no longer turned on whether the expert agency’s judgment amounted to a reasonable construction of otherwise ambiguous governing statutory language. [111] A court’s own view of the “best” interpretation of that language should instead be controlling. [112]",,0,html_body_unmatched

Unusual in those circumstances, the Court granted plenary review of the stay question, including oral argument before reaching a decision. [114] The stay motion was filed in October, and the Court’s ruling on the question was not until June 27, 2024, eight months later, and one of the Court’s last rulings before the summer recess.

While joining the majority opinion, the two Justices made clear their willingness to go further in cutting back on agency authority based on nondelegation doctrine and separation-of-powers concerns.

[128] Because federal environmental laws frequently assert federal rather than state sovereign authority, limit private property rights that threaten environmental degradation, and include federal criminal penalties parallel to a civil enforcement scheme, the Sackett Court’s reasoning seemed to place another bullseye on broader agency interpretations of federal environmental protection laws.

,,,,"In Loper Bright , the Court closed the deal foreshadowed by West Virginia and Sackett by formally overruling its 1984 decision in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc . [132] While the environmentalists had actually lost the case in Chevron , the framework announced by Justice Stevens for the Court in that case for how courts should consider the lawfulness of a federal agency’s interpretation of a federal statute had become one of the most cited and relied upon Court rulings for decades. [133] It was a framework that environmentalists had concluded allowed them to put forward their best arguments despite its origins in a case they had lost. [134] Chevron governed in particular when and to what extent a court should or should not defer to an agency interpretation of statutory language it was charged by Congress with administering. [135] Even in an otherwise sharply divided Court, there appeared to be common ground within the Court on the applicability of Chevron even if there were invariably instances when the individual Justices disagreed about which outcome Chevron supported in particular cases.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"By the time of the Loper Bright decision, however, there was nothing remotely surprising about the Court’s overruling of Chevron notwithstanding its historic pedigree. A sufficient number of individual Justices had made their objections to Chevron known, [136] and the Court had not applied Chevron deference since 2016. [137] One Justice on the Court, Justice Gorsuch, had seemed even to campaign for a Supreme Court nomination based on his desire to overrule Chevron . [138] Since Justice Gorsuch had joined the Court, both West Virginia’s Major Questions Doctrine and Sackett’s invocation of multiple canons of statutory construction also left little room for Chevron. Loper Bright for that reason was undoubtedly historically significant given Chevron’s outsized role for decades, but the judicial handwriting was well on the wall before its formal overruling.

It made clear that the Court would give no particular weight in balancing the equities to environmental protection concerns in deciding whether a stay of the rule is warranted. [143] The environmental benefits of the rule subject to a stay motion could be significant, but so too would be the economic costs of imposing the rule on industry. [144] The majority’s reasoning in Ohio also revealed an aggressive willingness to conclude that an agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating a rule―the judicial standard of review that is most deferential to agency decision making. The Court ruled that EPA had not quite sufficiently considered all possible contingencies in promulgating the rule, [145] even in the face of Justice Barrett’s dissent, which well argued that was not a fair characterization of the actual rulemaking record.

One might have fairly thought that when the meaning of the language was plain, that plain meaning would still, as before, control. And the judicial responsibility for now determining the “best” interpretation would be triggered only in those instances where the statutory meaning was otherwise ambiguous and subject to several possible reasonable interpretations. But, given City of San Francisco’s puzzling effort to invent statutory ambiguity were none existed, the import of Loper Bright seems potentially even greater still.

[167] The laws were ambitious, radically redistributive, and demanding in their declared short deadlines for change in what had been business as usual, no doubt sometimes unreasonably so.

With the perception that NEPA may now be interfering with climate goals, a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2023 to amend the law, even if amending only part of the law makes little sense in light of the rest of the law left unchanged.

And, of course, it is being tested to an unprecedented extent by a President who, unable to erase the federal environmental statutes on the books, seeks to create a legal revolution akin to the antithesis of that which created environmental law in the 1970s―by destroying the federal government agencies’ ability to administer that law through massive freezing of previously appropriated funding, future budget cuts, layoffs, and destruction of career employee morale, [200] and by relying on the Court’s recent rulings to justify eliminating all Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

,,,,,". The Court’s ruling in Seven County , however, adds a new, interesting twist on Loper Bright . To justify its holding that courts should defer to a federal agency’s decision on the proper boundaries for an EIS’s consideration of a proposed agency action’s environmental effects, the majority felt compelled to explain that the deference would not be to the agency’s legal interpretation of a statutory term within NEPA but instead “[f]or the most part” to the agency’s factual determination of “what details need to be included in any given EIS.” See Seven Cnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle County, 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1512 (2025). According to the Court, “whether a particular report is detailed enough in a particular case itself requires the exercise of agency discretion―which should not be excessively second-guessed by a court.” Id. The majority analogizes this kind of judicial determination to “whether the agency action was reasonable and reasonably explained” as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, thereby warranting application of that same Act’s “deferential arbitrary-and-capricious” standard consistent with Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Id. at 1511. As the Court’s inclusion of the caveat “for the most part” readily acknowledges, the distinction here of Loper Bright is a bit messy. Sometimes an agency is not merely assessing facts. Its determination of what facts are relevant can naturally be framed as turning on a question of law, including the meaning of statutory terms such as “environmental effects” and “detailed” in NEPA. For this reason, some may view Seven County as cutting back on Loper Bright , while others may view Seven County as simply making clear the longstanding distinction between judicial review of statutory interpretation under Chevron and judicial review of agency factual assessments under State Farm .",0,html_footnote_unmatched

Wisconsin , those favoring land-use restrictions on development of fragile ecosystems won a major victory when the Supreme Court rejected a regulatory takings challenge to a county ordinance that limited residential construction in a parcel of land adjacent to the St. Croix River. See Murr v. Wisconsin, 582 U.S. 383, 388–91, 405 (2017). The victory, however, was short-lived when the state legislature, in response to complaints from landowners, subsequently amended state law to allow such development in that area. See Murr v.

In the One Big Beautiful Act, signed by the President on July 4, 2025, a “project sponsor” whose project is subject to NEPA review may opt to pay the fees necessary for that review and in exchange any environmental assessment for which such a fee has been paid “shall be completed not later than 180 days after the date on which the fee is paid.” One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Pub. L. No. 119-21, sec. 60026, § 112(a)(3)–(4), 139 Stat. 72, 157 (2025).

This apparent shift in public sentiment regarding the efficacy of procedural requirements like NEPA to the extent that those requirements are seen as hindering needed growth are reflected in the recent book Abundance , which was published months after Seven County was briefed and argued. See generally Ezra Klein & Derek Thompson, Abundance (2025) (contending that ambitious and important public projects can be unduly hindered by laws like NEPA that require government agencies to consider the consequences of their actions before they act). More concretely, such a shift in public attitudes is reflected by California’s decision a month after Seven County to roll back its own state environmental assessment law, the California Environmental Quality Act, over environmentalist objections, based on an emerging consensus that such environmental review requirements interfere with the siting and construction of necessary affordable housing.
