1,State Regulation of Online Behavior: The Dormant Commerce Clause and Geolocation,section_header,body_text,"Fourth, an online firm’s inability to perfectly comply with a state regulation due to imperfections in the accuracy of geographical identification and filtering technology does not by itself mean the state regulation violates the Dormant Commerce Clause. The relevance of technological imperfection will depend in part on how demanding the state regulation is. Several state laws regulating minors’ access to pornography online have survived Dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny because they criminalize only intentional transmissions of banned materials to minors or to minors within a state. [132] For similar reasons, Dormant Commerce Clause concerns are significantly reduced if state law provides a defense for reasonable efforts to keep forbidden internet content out of the state. And the Supreme Court has said that a state’s efforts to minimize the interstate impact of a regulation, including through compliance software, is relevant to the discrimination and undue burden analyses.

In recent years, geolocation has become feasible and is routinely used by major websites for ordinary business purposes.

But HitchedIn decides not to allow (a) pages for same-sex weddings and (b) pages or comments containing pagan religious messages.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"And the same basic approach, we think, should apply to bans on political discrimination. (Some California cases suggest that California law already bans such discrimination, and various cities, counties, and territories have explicit rules along those lines. [165] ) If, say, Iowa law bans social media platforms from blocking Iowan-to-Iowan speech based on its viewpoint, whether religious, moral, or political, Iowa courts could, consistent with the Dormant Commerce Clause, apply that law to HitchedIn and, for that matter, to Facebook and Twitter—again, so long as those platforms could geolocate the communicating parties as being in Iowa. Likewise for quasi-common carrier statutes, which would ban social media platforms from blocking such communication more generally (perhaps with a few viewpoint-neutral exceptions, such as for spam or sexually themed material). This question was raised in the challenges to the Florida and Texas laws that banned social media platforms from discriminating based on political viewpoint, but those courts to date have focused on First Amendment issues and have not reached the Dormant Commerce Clause question.

And in the political discrimination ban, they are the benefits that the Court viewed as important in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

,,,,"1. Forbidding viewpoint discrimination by platforms when Iowans read material posted by Iowans . This is the analog of Option 1 for the other statutes discussed in previous sections.

,,,,"Indeed, such a nondiscrimination law would be similar to a normal public accommodation law that bans brick-and-mortar public accommodations—such as bars or stadiums—from excluding people based on their “political ideology,” including political speech. [171] Such a law may require multistate chains to develop different rules for different states in which they operate. It may lead to some interstate travelers being upset, for instance if they are used to the chain’s restaurants forbidding patrons from wearing Confederate-flag garb but have to endure seeing it in a jurisdiction that bans ideological discrimination. And it may have various other extraterritorial effects.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"2. Forbidding viewpoint discrimination by platforms when anyone reads material posted by Iowans . This is what we’ve also labeled Option 2 in the examples above, and it’s similar to the coverage of Florida’s social media law, [172] though that law focuses—improperly, we think—on “reside[nce]” or “domicile,” legal questions that platforms might not be able to easily answer, rather than on place of posting (or place from which the user created the account), which is a geographical question that platforms can answer more reliably. [173]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As we have noted above, this is a harder case to resolve with certainty, because any such law would require the platform to provide out-of-state users with a different experience than it would otherwise provide. Here, though, is a potentially helpful analogy: Imagine a multistate chain of stores that take wedding invitations supplied by the couples who are marrying, and—in a display of conspicuous consumption—hand-deliver them to recipients throughout the country. And imagine the company declines to do this for invitations to same-sex weddings. Iowa antidiscrimination law may well forbid such discrimination by Iowa branches of the chain that are serving Iowans, even as to invitations that are to be delivered to other states. [174] (As usual, let’s set aside any First Amendment objections to the law, and focus solely on the Dormant Commerce Clause. [175] )",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Iowa should be entitled to protect Iowans against discrimination based on sexual orientation, [176] even as to material that’s shipped from Iowa to other states. The same logic argues for the constitutionality, under the Dormant Commerce Clause, of the Iowa law that forbids a platform from discriminating based on viewpoint when anyone, including an out-of-stater, reads materials posted by Iowans.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"3. Forbidding viewpoint discrimination by platforms when Iowans read material posted by anyone . This is close to the California closed-captioning requirement upheld by the Ninth Circuit in Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness . California can require that CNN contents transmitted into California include closed captioning (even if CNN would otherwise prefer not to include it and doesn’t include it for viewers in other states). Iowa can likewise require that social media contents transmitted into Iowa include material that the platform would have preferred to delete. [177] A state generally has the power to require that products made available in that state have certain features, even if that covers businesses that would create those features outside the state.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"If these extra costs proved to be exorbitant, the outcome of a Pike balancing analysis might become difficult to predict. But as we have noted several times, platforms pervasively use geographical identification and filtering technology to serve their business ends, and so we suspect that it can be done at a reasonable cost here as well.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"4. Forbidding viewpoint discrimination by platforms when Iowans read material posted by anyone and when anyone reads material posted by Iowans. This appears to be similar to the approach of Texas’s social media law [178] and bills in other states, such as Georgia and Michigan.
