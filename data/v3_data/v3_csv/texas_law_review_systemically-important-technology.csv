In the previous subpart, we described a few hypothetical scenarios in which critical technology firms failed.

To further reinforce the need for attention to systemically important technology firms, we offer here two more extensive case studies of more likely scenarios.",,100.0,matched

There is evidence that in addition to outcompeting private taxi services and reducing car purchases among some populations, these platforms significantly reduce usage and therefore undermine the financial sustainability of public transportation.

[122] A market downturn in which investors lost confidence and additional capital was not available might drive them into insolvency. That would, in turn, not only have consequences for their investors, employees, and drivers, but could remove a major form of mobility from cities.

It is difficult to imagine how most major businesses, universities, and K-12 schools could have functioned effectively without it during 2020-2021. 46 Even as firms and schools return to in-person operations, they are continuing to use Zoom for meetings that previously would have been conducted in person.

Yet, it did not seriously threaten the financial sector, which not only survived the shock but helped the government provide aid to businesses adversely affected by it through  a  series  of  emergency  lending  programs. 236 Similarly, small businesses eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program were also meant to receive funds from the banks with which they had a relationship. 237 Banks, and above all the systemically important banks designated by FSOC, thus not only  proved  to  be  resilient  enough  to  withstand  a  major  shock  but  also assisted  the  government  in  providing  aid  to  the  rest  of  the  economy, consistent with the partnership model that characterizes financial regulation. 238 As a result, the performance of the banking system was deemed to be good-and  deemed to have been helped by the regulatory enhancements put in place by Dodd-Frank.

There is evidence that in addition to outcompeting private taxi services and reducing car purchases among some populations, these platforms significantly reduce usage and therefore undermine the financial sustainability of public transportation.

That would, in turn, not only have consequences for their investors, employees, and drivers, but could remove a major form of mobility from cities.

Facebook has become the way that people stay in touch with family and friends, interact with their social groups or communities, and find products or services.

[42] Founded in 2011, Zoom only went public in 2019. [43] Its video-conferencing software earned it a strong following in what was seen as a growing but still relatively niche market.

It is difficult to imagine how most major businesses, universities, and K–12 schools could have functioned effectively without it during 2020–2021.

That has changed, with widespread dissatisfaction growing over the firms and how they are regulated. As we will see, our proposal can address a serious gap in the regulatory environment now that these big firms have made something of a heel-turn. Microsoft and Apple rode the personal-computer revolution of the 1980s to supplant mighty IBM and other major technology or telecommunications firms of the day. [51] Google and Amazon launched with the internet revolution in the late 1990s, in part positioning themselves against Microsoft, which had become the most powerful company in technology. Facebook, and a host of smaller yet still huge companies, such as Netflix and Uber, came on the scene in the 2000s, as broadband and mobile connectivity set the stage for an era of “Web 2.0.” [52] All these companies have strong entrepreneurial DNA, with visionary founders—Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sergei Brin, and Larry Page—who steered them from their days in garages.

Designation, moreover, is not limited to banks—the market segment traditionally subject to the most stringent oversight—but can and has been extended to systemically important nonbanks like insurance companies.

AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google are 60% of the global market. [253] Because their business is to support services delivered by others, cloud infrastructure providers are necessarily highly interconnected with other firms. Whether there is sufficient substitutability would be an important question for a SINI designation inquiry.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The communications industry is subject to comprehensive regulation through the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies because of the combination of its societal importance and its tendency toward natural monopolies due to cost characteristics and network effects. While the sectoral communications regulatory regime is different in many ways from the horizontal systemic-importance inquiry we propose, it is similar in imposing obligations above and beyond generic ones such as consumer protection and antitrust. In the internet era, the question is whether firms that are traditionally regulated service providers, such as telephone and cable television companies, should nonetheless be subject to requirements based on their systemic importance. Internet service providers have significant power, which has led to efforts to impose network-neutrality requirements. [254] However, because they are providers of the physical wiring or wireless connections between end-users and the internet, their scope is necessarily geographically limited. A Verizon outage will not impact Comcast customers, even in the same city, nor will it likely affect Verizon users in other cities.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The communications services that generate systemic risks will operate at the application layer of the network, or at the software-infrastructure layer. The biggest segment in the former category involves multi-party video communications. Zoom in particular rose to prominence just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic as the primary method that many millions of individuals and thousands of organizations used to communicate. [255] Even after businesses and educational institutions have returned to in-person activities, remote or hybrid interaction remains a permanent feature for many meetings and classes. Zoom, as well as the business-focused video communications platforms provided by Microsoft and Google, would appropriately be considered for a systemically important designation.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The software infrastructure of networks would be the next area to seek systemically important providers. As already described, the RAND study found that GoDaddy, a relatively obscure provider of domain name registration services, was one of the most deeply interconnected firms in the U.S. economy. [256] This is no doubt because it provides an essential element of connectivity for so many businesses. Content delivery networks such as Akamai and Cloudflare, which maintain network performance and overcome denial-of-service attacks, are in a similar position. [257] None of these firms are massive by traditional metrics. Size is one of the factors for designation we adopt from the financial services model, so that might be enough to defeat a SINI classification. However, these firms touch many more users than the ones they serve directly.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Moving higher up in the network stack, there are also a set of software infrastructure providers for the applications and services provided over the internet, as opposed to for the baseline connectivity. Shopify, for example, is the dominant provider of e-commerce storefront capabilities to all but the largest businesses. [258] Twilio powers the majority of communications-oriented services, such as click-to-call functionality or text messaging, initiated through internet-based services. [259] Stripe and Square power all sorts of online payment activity; they are the glue behind the scenes that link traditional financial services systems such as credit card networks with internet activity. [260] As with the network software infrastructure, these providers are relatively small, and there is significant concentration in each market segment.",,0,html_body_unmatched

[261] Salesforce, the dominant customer relationship management platform, and the enterprise resource planning provider SAP, might also be essential to so many firms that their failure would rise to the level of systemic risk.

,,,,"We propose that a council of relevant federal regulators be brought together to identify and supervise Systemically Important Network Institutions, or SINIs. By analogy to FSOC, this would be designated the Technology Stability Oversight Council, or TechSOC.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The TechSOC structure would also force information sharing and other forms of informal coordination among agencies that otherwise have only a piece of the relevant information.,,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"FSOC has a chair in the Treasury Secretary, but our ideal council would not be run by a political appointee close to the President and could, potentially, include both Democratic and Republican representatives from the independent agencies in an effort to move the council out of the realm of politics. Many other administrative aspects of the TechSOC would need to be determined in any enabling legislation. Our purpose here is to establish generally the need for something along these lines, recognizing the need for further analysis to generate a fully formed proposal.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The creation of a TechSOC is, in our view, superior to some alternatives. We have a FSOC dedicated to matters of systemic risk, including, at least in theory, systemic risk that arises outside of the financial system, but it would be an inexpert regulator of technology. The TechSOC could adopt the approach of FSOC, while deploying the expertise of its members to identify systemic risk in tech. Rather than a council of technology-interested agencies, we could create a new super agency to regulate tech risk, but the council model reduces the risk of jurisdictional conflict between a new agency and its counterparts with other responsibilities in the technology sector. The council model, moreover, appears to have done well during the COVID-19 crisis, as we have observed, and so in some ways has won the right to be replicated. [273]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Both financial regulators and our technology oversight council would be looking for systemic risks posed by individual firms. In practice, this means a search for highly nonlocal effects of local disruptions. In the financial system, the analogy is often drawn to contagion. One firm suffers from, say, a bank run, and the effects are not only felt by it but by its counterparties, by firms that resemble it, and by firms that depend on those firms in turn. [274] The robust interconnectedness of the financial system, while a source of efficient capital allocation in normal times, makes it susceptible to panics and crises in bad times.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"We expect that the TechSOC would want to conduct studies looking for this kind of potential problem. The council might also look for choke points in the ecosystem—places where interconnectedness narrows and is concentrated. The search for such choke points is not only a matter for financial regulation. Health and safety regulators look for choke points in supply chains as good places to worry about alternatives and conversely, in some cases, focus their limited bandwidth. [276] Food regulators might therefore do inspections at ports rather than by trying to surveil every farm that produces consumable exports. In finance, the FSOC has facilitated the move of derivatives trading to exchanges and away from bespoke dealmaking by banks. [277] The idea is that the public observability offered by the exchanges will give regulators and others interested in the stability of the derivatives markets a window into sudden market moves. At the same time, the FSOC has designated these exchanges as systemically important and accordingly subject to extra regulatory requirements, particularly requirements to hold capital.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"On the other hand, technology regulators might view portions of the technology ecosystem that provide for interoperability as places where the choke-point risk has been addressed, substitutes have been welcomed, and because of the presence of alternatives, the concern about highly nonlocal effects of local collapses has become less salient.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The TechSOC would also look to finance-like factors in assessing the possibility of systemic risk. [278] Once it has identified particular firms—and perhaps certain widespread practices, if appropriate—as systemically important, it could then require those firms to engage in a particular suite of activities.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Stress tests for technology firms offer a similar kind of opportunity. Regulators could obligate systemically important technology outfits to perform an annual or semiannual emergency drill, requiring them to subject their programs to unlikely and adverse scenarios to provide both the firms and the government with some comfort that technology companies that passed the test would be capable of doing well in difficult times.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A second promising requirement for systemically important technology firms would be the creation of the living will. In finance, large banks and nonbank companies designated as systemic are required to file annual resolution plans, which are commonly known as the living will. [286] In such a plan, an institution needs to provide detailed information about its structure and operations and explain how it plans to carry out a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code without seeking extraordinary government support should a disastrous failure happen. [287] The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Fed jointly review the credibility and feasibility of the living will and provide written notice of deficiencies to institutions that fail to meet the agencies’ review standard. [288] If those institutions fail to appropriately revise and resubmit their plans, they may be subject to “more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements,” encounter “restrictions on its growth, activities, or operations,” or even be dismantled through “forced divestitures of its assets.” [289]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Finally, systemically risky finance firms are obligated to hold extra capital against their assets, so that there is a cushion of equity that can be deployed to soak up losses before those losses can be visited on other providers of capital to the firm. [293] The largest worry is that depositors might find their deposits impaired in a crisis. The analogy in technology would be an emergency, “rainy day” fund. Technology firms in distress would have the ability to draw on financial resources to address the crisis quickly; this deployment of emergency financing could bring in hackers to address the consequences of a hack, programmers to bolster the firm in the event of a disastrous programming bug, and so on.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"There is a pressing need for new insights in technology regulation. Even as the sector becomes more important, efforts to address its dangers are stymied in partisan fights and fixated on a narrow list of issues. A systemic risk regulation structure would provide a way for policymakers to ensure, hand-in-hand with technology firms themselves, that firms are resilient and that the system is a strong one. For tech platforms that have become too big to fail, we can no longer afford to focus energy only on their bigness.

The Fed’s interest in the area has grown but has longstanding roots. As Peter Conti-Brown and David Wishnick have put it:By the 1970s, the Fed not only had teams of technologists at the individual Reserve Banks but also had a specialized team dedicated to long-range telecommunications planning, which developed an early example of a packet-switched network as part of the Division of Data Services. Along with these investments in advanced infrastructure came investments in security and redundancy to prevent costly system outages. Today, the Fed is a large employer of cybersecurity personnel—witness the over one hundred analysts who comprise the National Incident Response Team, dedicated to responding to the highest-impact threats to the Federal Reserve System and the broader financial sector, especially those incidents that involve attempts to penetrate Fed computers.Peter Conti-Brown & David A.
