1,"Violence in the United States is distinctive in many ways, perhaps none more visceral and fundamental than the technologies with which it is practiced. American violence disproportionately involves guns, and because guns are such an effective tool of violence, confrontations involving them are disproportionately  deadly. Decades of  research  confirm  this  'instrumentality effect,' and it is reflected in the broad, bipartisan agreement that the nation has a gun violence problem. The deep disagreement, of course, remains about how to address it, with most of the debate focused on regulating who can carry which guns, where, and how.",text,text,,,60.0,unmatched
1,"But  fully  understanding,  let  alone  addressing,  the  problem  of  violence requires accounting for not only regulation but the economic and legal forces shaping the instruments that inflict and resist it-what we call the technologies of violence. Just as violence itself can be permissible and even desirable (as in cases of justified self-defense) or not (as in cases of criminal misuse), innovations in violence technology can simultaneously improve and threaten public safety. As  the  most  prominent  form  of  that  technology,  guns  illustrate  the  point particularly  clearly.  Historically,  innovation  has  made  guns  more  lethal-a change whose overall impact on public safety is contested-but it also has the potential  to  make  them  safer,  for  example  through  better  reliability,  safety switches,  smart  gun  technology,  microstamping,  and  other  technological enhancements.",text,text,,,56.52173913043479,unmatched

As noted above,  this  will  happen  when  consumers  are  biased,  have  imperfect information, or their actions generate externalities. 88 It will also happen for the simple reason that innovative technologies are often expensive, especially when they are covered by patents that increase their prices. 89 Thus, supply side  incentives  like  patents  will  induce  innovation  in  directions  where relatively wealthy people can afford the new technology, even if the prime safety beneficiaries would be the poor. 90 But many valuable innovations are for poorer communities.

Such innovations are not “gun control”; they do not deprive anyone of a weapon, and in that sense are entirely consistent with the desire of some Americans to have and use guns for self-defense, while enhancing public safety overall. To return to LaPierre’s aphorism: Wouldn’t it be even better if the good guy is armed with a functional smart gun, while the bad guy’s stolen smart gun is locked because he is not an authorized user?",,96.73202614379085,matched

Generally speaking, consumers want new and safer technologies, which gives firms incentive to create and supply them. But, as on the supply side, there are reasons why demand for innovation can be suboptimal. As noted above, this will happen when consumers are biased, have imperfect information, or their actions generate externalities. [88] It will also happen for the simple reason that innovative technologies are often expensive, especially when they are covered by patents that increase their prices. [89] Thus, supply side incentives like patents will induce innovation in directions where relatively wealthy people can afford the new technology, even if the prime safety beneficiaries would be the poor.

[92] A federal program was created to provide financial support for these purchases, which in turn motivated carmakers to produce them.

With performance standards, manufacturers are free to meet the standard in any manner they see fit, leaving open the possibility of innovative solutions to the problem.

People generally agree that society is better off with less disease and will tend to welcome innovative medicines that combat it, even if they disagree about which innovations achieve that goal. But for many people and in many contexts, the threat or infliction of violence is a solution to public safety problems, including violence itself. This same complication extends to violence technologies, because the power of an instrument to inflict violence has a deeply contested and fundamentally ambiguous relationship to public safety. [104] Nearly all the features that make guns safety-enhancing from the perspective of some (for example as tools of self-defense) also make them dangerous (for example, as instruments of criminal, impulsive, or accidental violence). It follows that “gun safety” is a complicated and perhaps counterintuitive concept precisely because guns are designed to be dangerous. Guns’ dangerousness is the very reason why many Americans think they promote public safety.

Both sides generally begin with some shared premises: that unjustified gun violence is bad and public safety is good. But they have fundamentally contradictory prescriptions about how to get less of the bad and more of the good, since the product one side sees as the problem, the other side sees as the solution. [107] That makes the debate difficult but not necessarily intractable. Guns have their own political and legal baggage, to be sure, but they fit within a broader category of products that are inherently dangerous—where some degree of danger is part of the function—and nonetheless should be made as safely as possible. The same is true of table saws, meat slicers, and even chemotherapy drugs. Just as chemotherapy should kill cancerous cells while harming as few healthy cells as possible, guns should be dangerous (in the sense of being powerful and effective) when appropriately used in justified self-defense, and safe (ineffective) when in the hands of an unsupervised toddler.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"It is easy enough to dismiss the “good guy with a gun” trope. But it does usefully capture a deep market logic regarding the relationship between public safety and the technology of violence that deserves to be taken seriously. Consider the “marketplace of ideas” metaphor that has fundamentally shaped First Amendment law and scholarship. [113] The underlying supposition of that metaphor is that, as Justice Louis Brandeis put it, the proper remedy for bad ideas is not legal intervention but “more speech.” [114] Though expressed more like a bumper sticker, LaPierre’s statement essentially picks up the same logic.

ShotSpotter is paid for by taxpayers, after all, and may also generate negative side effects by reducing privacy and increasing the burdens of policing on communities already suffering over-carceralization.

The point is that these technologies of violence are contingent, and the markets which produce them are potentially subject to a variety of distortions, whether it be over-reliance on private choice when externalities and other market failures make it an unreliable guide to social welfare, or over-reliance on government decision-making when doing so leads to inefficient and inequitable spending.",,0,html_body_unmatched

CPSC’s limited ability to regulate firearms was on ironic display recently when the Commission mandated the recall of biometrically opened gun safes after a 12-year old died when he opened a safe and fired the gun he found inside.

Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s unqualified command. ” [278] The Court recognized that “unprecedented societal concerns or dramatic technological changes may require a more nuanced approach” [279] and even emphasized that the test permits “ new ” regulations, [280] but nonetheless applied the test rigidly—a pattern followed by many lower courts.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “dangerous and unusual” weapons can be prohibited and has equated that category with those weapons not “in common use at the time.” [310] The difficulties of this test are evident: How common? For what uses? Taken literally, the test would permit the gun industry to expand the category of constitutionally protected “Arms” simply by flooding the market with a new model of weapon or accessory before the government can effectively regulate it.
