[71] “[Y]ou could have historical precedents from older language, and now newer language is in conflict with that older language, and the older language has not been removed from the statute,” one person explained. [72] Although in principle, “the newer language trumps the older language, . . . it’s not always that clear. Sometimes, it’s not as though it’s in conflict or even informing it, it could make what’s already an ambiguous provision even more ambiguous.” [73] Other legal developments might contribute to this evolution, too: “A lot of times we were working with statutes that had a history, so it would be not only the language of the statute would be relevant or legislative history, but there’d be a fairly substantial case history . . . [making a] precedential body.” [74] And sometimes “things just aren’t spelled out,” and officials might turn to their own foundational documents for guidance as to how to proceed.

1,"Agencies, we show, act as a statute's custodians, managing the statutory regime over a life cycle that exceeds any single governing coalition. Borrowing ideas from private law, we argue that agency officials act as if they owe their statutes duties of loyalty and care. The assumed duty of loyalty pushes agencies to serve the best interests of the statutes they manage. They ground their work in statutory text and are guided by a sense of agency mission-an enduring but evolving understanding of the agency's overarching goals. In fulfilling their duty of care, agency officials take the steps they see as reasonable for the purposes of effectuating their statutes. Agencies  approach  statutes from  a range  of perspectives, taking into account the changing realities of the regulated world; the views and interests of regulated publics; the positions of Congress's members and  committees;  the  preferences  of  presidents  and  their  appointees;  and  the",text,footnote,,.

But while mission has a goal-infused quality, being guided by mission does not mean that agencies are purposivist as understood within juricentric theory. 25 Purposivism (like textualism) is an 'archeological' approach to interpretation that assumes a statute's 'meaning . . . is set in stone on the date of its enactment, and it is the  interpreter's  task  to  uncover  and  reconstruct  that  original  meaning.' 26 Agencies,  in  contrast,  seek  to  ensure  that  a  statute  remains  relevant  and efficacious  through  social,  legal,  and  political  changes,  sometimes  over lengthy periods. 27 The sense of mission we found was rooted in the statute but not coterminous with its text or even its enacting context-it evolved over time.",text,footnote,,.

It perhaps should come as no surprise that lawyers within agencies play a significant, if not lead, role in tying agency action to fidelity to statutory texts. Officials highlighted general counsel offices’ important role in ensuring concordance between policy and statute. As one interviewee explained, interpretive creativity can generate “pushback” from lawyers, underscoring that agency lawyers (and other career civil servants) often set the bounds of work with statutes. [79] But even as agencies treat statutory text as foundational to their policymaking process, statutory text in itself does not suffice to resolve the issues agencies tackle.

As  one  interviewee  explained,  interpretive creativity can generate 'pushback' from lawyers, underscoring that agency lawyers (and other career civil servants) often set the bounds of work with statutes. 79 But even as agencies treat statutory text as foundational to their policymaking process, statutory text in itself does not suffice to resolve the issues  agencies  tackle.

24,"1.  Sources of Mission .-The statutes that mandate and constrain agency action  are  central  determinants  of  an  agency's  mission.  Specific  statutory language or a foundational committee report may define a clear mission that carries through all of the agency's work. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which created the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), itself articulated the Act's overarching mission: 'to protect the health and safety of the Nation's coal miners.' 84 Congress passed the statute as a direct response to a massive underground mine explosion, and the statute's supporting committee report clearly articulated a vision repeated by President Nixon upon signing the bill-that it was 'a crucially needed step forward in the protection of America's coal miners.' 85  MSHA officials in our study described that mission as permeating the agency's work and its officials' self-conception. '[E]verybody I work with is very focused on mine safety. The  legislative history specifically  says  everything  should  be interpreted,  when  in  doubt,  on  the  side  of  mine  safety.

Maybe it's trying to clean up the air and water and if so, then let's lean in that direction.' 92 Another spoke in terms of a statute's overarching purpose: to 'best serve the Medicare beneficiaries because  ultimately  that's  what  Medicare's  there  to  serve.

A sense of agency mission can provide a common  orientation across multiple decisionmakers,  even  while  it  remains  somewhat  general  and  subject  to gradual  change.

33,"By bringing these elements of the duty of care to light, our study shows that agencies tend to be self-consciously pragmatic; they are not typically searching for transhistorically or absolutely correct answers. 138  We show how agencies, as  their statute's  custodians, mediate  and  participate in defining their statutes' meaning by determining what they will become in practice. Bearing responsibility for the statutory scheme makes agencies more than mechanistic  agents  of  the  current  Congress,  or  servants  of  the  sitting president. The statute, after all, belongs to neither. Although scholarship and doctrine often present agencies as working in a fairly clear-cut principalagent  relationship,  agency  loyalties  quickly  overflow  the  discrete,  simple vessels thought to contain them. 139 In some sense, we can say that statutes lack much independent meaning; they act as resources whose significance derives largely from how agencies fulfill their duty of care.

On the one hand, agency information collection is often unsystematic and inefficient. And agency decisionmaking is often influenced most by well-resourced regulated industries serving their own  economic  interests.  On  the  other  hand,  agencies  can  and  often  do convene a wide range of participants when formulating policy ideas. And they have personnel and systems in place for taking into account multiple diverse interests. Indeed, their capacity to incorporate and negotiate among pluralistic views in any given policy decision process probably outstrips that of other government  institutions. As  we  discuss  further in Part III, strengthening  and  channeling  these  pluralistic  decisionmaking  capacities would significantly enhance government's democratic quality, a possibility that  in  turn  underscores  the  serious  costs  of  the  current  presidential administration's  efforts  to  dismantle  bureaucratic  capacity,  as  well  as  of recent Supreme Court doctrine that has been redistributing decisionmaking power to the far less accountable federal courts. 191",text,footnote,,.

None claimed-or even claimed to strive for-the kind of neutrality sometimes attributed to idealized administration. In our view, this open acceptance of normative, political considerations is a strength, as is agencies'  concern  about  consequences.  The  implementation  of  statutes involves  choices  that  inevitably  distribute  public  goods  and  constraints unevenly; there is no neutral outcome. Claims to neutrality only obfuscate the  value  judgments  and  political  considerations  that  inevitably  attend statutory effectuation.

Specific statutory language or a foundational committee report may define a clear mission that carries through all of the agency’s work. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which created the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), itself articulated the Act’s overarching mission: “to protect the health and safety of the Nation’s coal miners.” [84] Congress passed the statute as a direct response to a massive underground mine explosion, and the statute’s supporting committee report clearly articulated a vision repeated by President Nixon upon signing the bill—that it was “a crucially needed step forward in the protection of America’s coal miners.” [85] MSHA officials in our study described that mission as permeating the agency’s work and its officials’ self-conception. “[E]verybody I work with is very focused on mine safety. The legislative history specifically says everything should be interpreted, when in doubt, on the side of mine safety. I sort of take that command from Congress. It’s nothing that would need to be said.” [86] This explicit “unidirectional mandate” [87] makes MSHA decisionmaking “always about safety, and health, and . . . how best to promote safety and health within . . . the possible range of interpretations.” [88]",,100.0,matched

We want to do it in a way that . . . is as efficient and least burdensome as can be based on the language of the statute.” [89] We heard that kind of overarching, general, and relatively simple sense of mission repeatedly in our interviews, often in the course of an official explaining some particular process or decision. “Sort of the unifying thing about [a particular agency],” another subject said, is that all parts of it are “very much focused on preventing harm to [a particular group].” [90] As another person put it, “[W]e’re dealing with a very mission-oriented agency, an agency that thinks if the air is cleaner we’re doing a good job, not like if [some] company has higher profits we’re doing a good job.” [91] Officials might ask in a “broad sense, what is the statute trying to do? Maybe it’s trying to clean up the air and water and if so, then let’s lean in that direction.” [92] Another spoke in terms of a statute’s overarching purpose: to “best serve the Medicare beneficiaries because ultimately that’s what Medicare’s there to serve.

[278] Scholars have asked whether agency statutory interpretation does or should resemble textualism or purposivism, or examined how much administrators know about, and follow, such judicial tenets and canons of interpretation. [279] Our Article poses a different set of questions focused on how agencies understand what they are supposed to be doing with statutes. Our effort to answer these questions helps bring to light a set of political and legal practices that are crucial to understanding how law is given effect in the world—practices influenced but hardly determined by (and sometimes inconsistent with) those of courts.

[18] Specifically, our empirical research supports an understanding of agencies as custodians of the statutes they administer. [19] Regulatory statutes authorize, mandate, and constrain agency action. Agencies, in turn, construct regimes to effectuate their statutes, maintaining them over time even as the enacting political coalition fades away.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Our conclusions resonate with recent normative elaborations of a “‘fiduciary model’ in administrative law,” which proposes that we understand statute-enacting electoral coalitions to “entrust [agencies] with regulatory discretion over an area of public concern,” treating agencies as bound by “a duty of fidelity to their statutory mandates, and duties of care and loyalty to their statutory beneficiaries,” while also subjecting agencies to monitoring. [20] For instance, Evan Criddle has argued that agencies’ “fidelity to their legal mandates and the public welfare” offers a form of accountability and responsibility independent of “electoral authorization” or majoritarianism. [21] Others have argued that the Constitution itself imposes a fiduciary imperative on the Executive. [22] Most of this scholarship makes a case that agencies should be understood as having fiduciary duties based on constitutional, normative, or public law principles. We take a more empirical tack. Our interviews indicate that many agency personnel describe their work in ways that comport with the fiduciary model without using that terminology. Numerous agency personnel share a role morality that befits a public fiduciary, giving an empirical basis for public fiduciary theory’s normative arguments.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Our study offers a rejoinder to abstract battles over constitutional principle—abstractions that obscure political conflicts over the very existence and extent of regulation.

In other words, our work helps show that administrative agencies and the work they do with statutes are democratically vital and necessary. Recognizing these features seems especially important today, in the face of tectonic doctrinal and political changes that may dramatically transform how agencies function.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In Part I, we show that officials’ main loyalty is not so much to Congress or the President as to their statutory regimes. This loyalty entails attention to statutory text. Not everyone involved in producing a policy combs through the statutory language, but someone does: Agencies’ divisions of labor allow statutory text to play a central role in the policymaking process without being central to every participant. Taking text seriously, however, does not make agencies textualist. The practices our respondents described do not comport with the tenets of textualism as laid out in judicial interpretive theories, nor did interviewees claim adherence to those tenets. [24] A fair number were not sure what textualism even was. Rather, a wide world beyond the text informed their dealings with statutes.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"One central factor we found shaping agencies’ work with statutes was the pursuit of agency mission—a factor we identify and define because it emerged so consistently in our interviews. Mission is a cultural factor in agency work, an enduring yet evolving influence over the agency’s role that channels and shapes discretionary decisionmaking. But while mission has a goal-infused quality, being guided by mission does not mean that agencies are purposivist as understood within juricentric theory. [25] Purposivism (like textualism) is an “archeological” approach to interpretation that assumes a statute’s “meaning . . . is set in stone on the date of its enactment, and it is the interpreter’s task to uncover and reconstruct that original meaning.” [26] Agencies, in contrast, seek to ensure that a statute remains relevant and efficacious through social, legal, and political changes, sometimes over lengthy periods. [27] The sense of mission we found was rooted in the statute but not coterminous with its text or even its enacting context—it evolved over time.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"We also found that the concept of mission helps structure the interagency interactions and conflicts that form an integral part of the policymaking process. An agency, after all, cannot make policy on its own: Agencies are not just structured by internal divisions of labor, but subject to external ones as well. More than one agency often has a say in any given process, and agencies with differing missions will bring differing normative considerations and practical concerns to bear. This pluralistic phenomenon may arise by congressional design and create productive counterweights within the policymaking process, but it can also impede agencies’ custodial abilities by enabling one agency’s mission to run roughshod over others’. Text and mission ultimately focus officials on the interests of the statutory regime itself—not quite the same thing as the Congress that enacted the statute, nor the Congress that currently oversees the agency’s work, nor a presidential administration past or present.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Such internal workings are difficult to identify in publicly visible end products like Federal Register notices. When we reviewed the rulemaking publications of many of the specific policies our interviewees discussed, we found little sign of the intensive production process our respondents revealed to us. [36] That is to be expected. The Federal Register presents the public with the outcomes of agency processes and the reasons that best support those results—it does not purport to provide a policy’s biography. But to understand what administrative agencies actually do within our system requires this very knowledge.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Agencies implement and administer the statutes that give them authority to act. Whom, or what, do they serve in that process? A transmission belt model suggests that agencies serve Congress; [41] a presidentialist approach suggests the President. [42] Much administrative-law and separation-of-powers scholarship contends at length over which of the two constitutional branches agencies should and do serve. Our study indicates, instead, that agencies serve something else both obvious and overlooked: They bear a duty of loyalty to statutes themselves. Both Congress and the President contribute to enacting statutes, but in our interviews, statutes qua statutes transcended the two branches. Recognizing the centrality of the statutes themselves helps reveal agencies’ crucial role within our democratic system of government—a role increasingly under pressure from Supreme Court doctrine as well as presidential politics.

,,,,"This obligation of “stewardship” emerged forcefully in our interviews, reinforcing observations by other scholars, such as Jerry Mashaw, David Spence, and Jody Freeman, who have described agencies as statutes’ congressionally appointed custodians. [46] When a Congress and a President enact a regulatory statute, they place some socioeconomic arena within an agency’s purview, tasking the agency with addressing matters that arise within that arena. The statute gives the agency legal authority and resources for this work, even as it constrains the agency’s decisionmaking scope through mandates, guidelines, and exceptions. The statute is thus the main backdrop against which agency action takes place. Our study not only shows that agency officials often understand themselves to be playing this custodial role but also reveals what this role actually consists of.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In its custodial role, the agency must find sense and coherence when implementing open-ended texts and words. [61] But our subjects generally did not describe themselves as searching for a statutory text’s “best” meaning most of the time: Statutes’ pervasive open-endedness meant that, often, there was no necessarily best interpretation of any given provision. Our respondents agreed that statutory text must be able to bear the meanings a policy ascribes to the text, but as one official put it, “[i]t was very hard to say what would be the best interpretation independent of policy consideration[s].” [62] As another suggested, “Once Congress unleashed the tools, I think [agency officials] view it as their responsibility to utilize those tools from a policy choice as best as they think is appropriate for the public interest,” and “they’re going to experiment and do that until a court would tell them that they have misinterpreted the powers that were given to them.” [63] Rather than searching for an eternal, uniquely correct meaning, agencies generally work with statutory text to “advance reasonable interpretations that we thought best served the policy goals of the statute and of the administration.” [64] And in the case of “a really badly drafted statute,” with which “you were sort of trying to make a set of words [work] in the context that it wouldn’t normally work in,” there might be no other choice than asking, “[H]ere’s our broader goal. How do we fit that within what these [words] mean[]?” [65]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Other officials were even more explicit that their use of statutes was goal driven—motivated by a pragmatic impulse to create effective policy grounded in statutory authority. As interviewees underscored in describing their work with statutes, agencies (especially lawyers) often ask: Does the statute support a desired policy? Does it offer underutilized authorities? [66] Can we reconfigure existing rules for new purposes? Some respondents described themselves as turning to statutes in search of authority to support or enable what they sought to do, not always to understand in the first instance what they were supposed to do: “[T]he first question isn’t ‘what do these statutory words mean?,’ because you’re in a space. You’re regulating within a space . . . and then it becomes, you want to do this thing . . . and then you’re going back in statutes to see if you can do it.” [67] As another subject said, “I can literally remember being in the room and who the colleague was who had crawled through every part of the statute to say, well, where’s a thing that we could waive that would provide some flexibility on this.” [68] While agency lawyers may help policymakers “figure out congressional intent” and while “courts have their rules about what to turn to first, and which documents have precedence,” one official told us, “my experience just on a practical level, it’s really case-by-case, and it’s driven by the political process, driven by the goals you’re setting for the agency.” [69] Creative use of statutory text might even become part of the job: “[P]eople are trying to push the boundaries by reading the regulations that are on the books the way that they think they need to do their job, not so much a power grab as you’re a professional, you’re trying to accomplish your goal, trying to be creative.” [70]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"To be sure, attention to statutory text was unevenly distributed amongst our respondents. As one non-lawyer put it, “I guess you could say the statute’s in the back of our mind . . . [b]ut nobody’s going out and reading the caselaw or anything like that.” [76] “To be honest with you,” a subject-matter expert told us, “I never read the Act nor did I think most people on a day-to-day basis were aware of it. . . . [A]s a political appointee, . . . [I] had a few different missions and responses.” [77] For some officials, lawyerly approaches to statutory authority stood in the way of accomplishing the agency’s objectives: “Sometimes there’s an undercurrent of ‘the darn lawyers are slowing us down’ and ‘we care about . . . safety.’ That line gets used in the agency itself against the lawyers” who ensure statutory fidelity. [78]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Throughout our interviews, we identified a second dimension of the duty of loyalty that shaped officials’ pursuit of policy goals within statutory frameworks. Officials across agencies displayed a commitment to overarching objectives and values that they cited as representing the fundamental purposes of the agency’s work. [81] This sense of agency mission guided how officials put statutes to work in any given context. Rather than settling the meaning of a particular word or the details of a specific policy, officials spoke of agency mission as providing a general value orientation that influenced how they approached their policy choices, without determining the conclusions they would come to. While certainly not the exclusive source of officials’ purpose or motivation, mission operated as a rudder to steer agencies’ work with their statutes and gave their work a rough coherence over time.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Even as agency officials characterized themselves as seeking to advance their mission, they also demonstrated a commitment to pursuing the priorities of the extant presidential administration. Importantly, however, we found that the latter can often be complementary to or shaped by the former. As we have documented elsewhere, we consistently heard about the ways in which political officials defined agencies’ purposes: “[T]he people who work at senior levels . . . , they come in with an agenda,” one official told us—an agenda that drives them to analyze the relevant statute for the “degrees of freedom you have to make changes to regulation.” [94] Some officials saw their work as necessarily closely aligned with presidential projects: “We’re an executive agency, so it’s hard to think about priorities of the agency that aren’t also the President’s priorities.” [95] And “a particular philosophy within a given administration,” such as creating “innovation” or “bringing new technology into the system,” might lead officials to “try[] to find interpretations that allow us to do that versus maybe some other kind” of policy. [96] Political officials might be particularly motivated by public perception and political salience, especially in relation to hot-button issues. [97]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But the interaction between a particular administration’s philosophy and priorities and the preexisting sense of agency mission could be complex. On the one hand, “there’s a natural hesitancy to just overturn past interpretations. . . . [F]or one thing you want the work you did to live on. . . . [Y]ou don’t want to create a culture where you think it’s okay for every new administration just to undo everything that was done before.” [98] As a career civil servant told us, “I think most [political appointees] just want to come in and manage the stewardship of the program and propel it forward and make it better for the next generation.” [99] At the same time, appointees generally were understood to come in with political objectives and ideological predilections—projects they wanted to accomplish and values they wanted to pursue. [100] Career staff, with generally longer tenures, could have different reactions to that: “[A] lot of times when a politico comes along and says, ‘Hey, we’re going to go 100% recycled,’ sometimes the career staffers are rolling their eyes and sometimes, they’re like, ‘Okay, awesome, here’s my opportunity.’” [101] Either way, political appointees often needed to integrate their goals with a longer term sense of agency mission to be successful: As we have argued elsewhere, political appointees and career civil servants play complementary, interdependent roles, each crucial to the agency’s work. [102] Appointees may come in with political objectives and ideological predilections, but they may also join agencies because of some concordance between their own professional objectives and the agency’s work.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Regardless of their intentions, political officials can find their ability to advance preferred objectives constrained by the mission-driven and statutorily defined boundaries of the institutions they enter. “In any change of administration, there are always changes at the edges, and we expect that. But in terms of core principles and activities, they more or less remain the same.” [103] Indeed, our interviews underscored how agencies can develop a strong sense of internal culture and character—a self-understanding of “how we do things around here” that guides decisions, whether that is a “long history . . . of bipartisan cooperation” in an independent agency, [104] an understanding that an agency-internal body “does not like to overrule itself,” [105] or a culture of “everybody staying in their lane.” [106] Long-serving career officials, many of whom relate deeply to their agency’s mission, are likely to internalize the agency’s culture and purposes, carrying them through the agency’s work across administrations. [107] One interviewee explained how long-time officials’ commitment to mission might constrain political ambitions: “[C]areer folks tend to be much more conservative or let’s just say risk averse and tend to think of themselves as the keeper of the programs and wanting to keep the bad people out as opposed to the opposite, trying to get more people in.” [108] Our interviews suggest that we should think of political officials’ ambitions as being incorporated into rather than replacing agency mission.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,".—As our account of agencies’ work with statutory texts underscores, officials’ pursuit of agency mission did not replace the analysis of texts. Instead, officials’ sense of mission provided them with a rudder that steered their decisions about available policy options. A sense of agency mission can provide a common orientation across multiple decisionmakers, even while it remains somewhat general and subject to gradual change. Statutes, after all, construct complex environments with many competing priorities: Any given provision’s instruction can be read in a number of ways. Most statutes do not specify one single value to hold above all others. Figuring out how to actually proceed requires policy judgment. Making a plan for regulatory action takes more than just identifying what the statute allows.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Interviewees explained how agencies must consider the effects they seek to achieve, the values they hope to serve, and how their choices relate to other policy goals whose relative costs and benefits may be hard to commensurate. [109] As one interviewee explained, “You have to turn to how much [regulatory] protection you want, how much cost you’re willing to impose, what the politics are.” [110] Another, in the context of a consumer protection statute, noted that the agency considered “[w]hat’s good for the American consumer . . . ? Also, . . . what works for business? . . . [You must be m]indful for the effects of your legislation on a bunch of stakeholders.” [111] Because agency action affects different people in different ways, a benefit often comes with its own cost: Simplifying eligible people’s access to entitlements increases opportunities for ineligible people to gain access, but blocking ineligible people increases the obstacles to eligible people too. Statutes rarely spell out the terms of these tradeoffs. [112] But as we saw in our interviews, a sense of mission can help steer these choices by keeping officials alert to the normative decisions that policymaking inevitably involves. [113]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The sense of agency mission we identified helped officials define problems worth addressing and identify the policy experiments or political conflicts worth engaging in. As one official put it, “I think that, in the end, . . . people thought that the statutes were kind of with them. . . . They had the law at their backs and that doesn’t come from particular little words in a statute.” [128] Indeed, many of our respondents defined their success in terms of the extent to which they advanced the agency’s mission. [129] Effective policy could mean “maki[ng] sure whatever you do, you’re building enough program integrity into the system so that you don’t make it easy for scoundrels and fraudsters to come and raid the . . . program.” [130] From the administrator’s perspective, this utility helps explain the pervasive influence of mission we observed in policymaking. From a systemic standpoint, this sense of mission helps agencies mediate differing policy perspectives over historical time and sociological space. [131]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For agencies to fulfill their role as custodians of statutes, they must “build [the] thing” [132] for which they were given responsibility. In our interviews, we saw pervasive and consistent preoccupation with ensuring that statutory schemes worked —that the rules, guidelines, and policies agencies adopted functioned effectively in the contexts and circumstances within the agencies’ purview. Our respondents made clear that statutes were not so much for understanding as for governing: “So, your statute is incredibly general, and so then you need to make it real.” [133]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Agency personnel often described themselves as acting incrementally, focusing on the practical effects of their policy choices. One person involved in Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation described the kinds of considerations that went into any policy decision: “One is just . . . ‘Will this make the marketplace stronger? Will it make it easier for the insurance companies that are participating to . . . price risk?,’” thereby encouraging participation and helping effectuate the statute. [134] “The second . . . ‘Will it be more efficient?’ Like just eliminate points of friction in the system. And then another dimension is . . . ‘Will it protect people from abuses by other actors in the system?’” [135] Many respondents shared this overarching practical concern with policy effects. “[Y]ou always know that statutes are enacted for some purpose,” one said. [136] “They have some goal in mind. . . . So then the question is, whether [the policy] advances the purpose of the statute . . . consistent with what the statute requires, and [considering] what burdens are going to be imposed on the people who have to live with it.” [137]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"By bringing these elements of the duty of care to light, our study shows that agencies tend to be self-consciously pragmatic; they are not typically searching for transhistorically or absolutely correct answers. [138] We show how agencies, as their statute’s custodians, mediate and participate in defining their statutes’ meaning by determining what they will become in practice. Bearing responsibility for the statutory scheme makes agencies more than mechanistic agents of the current Congress, or servants of the sitting president. The statute, after all, belongs to neither. Although scholarship and doctrine often present agencies as working in a fairly clear-cut principal–agent relationship, agency loyalties quickly overflow the discrete, simple vessels thought to contain them. [139] In some sense, we can say that statutes lack much independent meaning; they act as resources whose significance derives largely from how agencies fulfill their duty of care. Our research thus supports Jerry Mashaw’s proposal to “imagine agency statutes as works-in-progress, to be shaped and molded by continuous interaction among the implementing agency, the political branches and affected interests.” [140]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In emphasizing the pluralism that undergirds agencies’ efforts to create workable policies, we should underscore that influence over their work is not necessarily equally distributed. Even as our interviewees described their efforts to be responsive to the public and to facts on the ground, we cannot discount the well-established reality that economically powerful voices often dominate the conversation with agencies, just as they do with other government institutions. [141] But the pluralism we show pervading the policymaking process builds a solid foundation for further democratizing governance. As we explore in Part III, this foundation places agencies in a unique position to keep a statutory scheme relevant and responsive to complex current circumstances, and it pushes them to take into account a broad range of perspectives, claims, and information as they work with statutes.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Our interviewees also demonstrated how agencies often develop awareness of the issues they need to address by receiving various forms of feedback from the outside world. “Definitely on the overall policy mandate,” one person observed, “hearing from people doing the work, living under the statutes, regs, [engaging in the regulated activity], dramatically informed our policy, including shifts we made in our own policy over time that were pretty visible and in response to what we were hearing and seeing.” [151] Another person explained: “[W]e literally got zillions of questions on a daily basis, like any agency, from people who are trying to interpret what they are supposed to do under the law.” [152] Another respondent recalled that “no one really cared about [a particular issue] in terms of the . . . political coalitions . . . in Congress . . . but somehow the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post . . . were obsessed with it.” [153] These “editorials often were just like, ‘Hurry up and get the damn thing done,’ rather than, ‘It should have X, Y, and Z.’” [154] And “my boss, basically, . . . would see that and say, ‘What’s up? . . . . Let’s try to get this going more quickly.’” [155] Pressure, publicity, and novel arguments from the media, interest groups, and regulated parties could push agencies to return to their statutory authorities in search of a response. [156]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The actual work of superintending a regulatory regime also produced information that gave agency officials motivation to act. Enforcement staff, “always briefing up,” alerted other officials to implementation problems or a lack of fit between regulations and social practices or products. [157] As one interviewee noted, with enough uncertainty, “the agency is like, ‘This is a source of confusion, and we need to—our job is supposed to be to provide certainty to the petitioners and applicants’”—to make decisions enabling the agency to say, “[t]his is what the answer is.” [158] In one example, a statute provided a reimbursement scale that used rural facilities as a payment floor, on the assumption that rural facilities had relatively fewer resources. [159] Then a highly resourced facility in a low-density area was reclassified as a rural facility. That change would have garnered its state a windfall of several hundred million dollars from a budget shared across all states. [160] Members of Congress from that state lobbied the agency to keep the reclassification. [161] That kind of situation placed the agency between conflicting interpretations and preferences, alerting it to potentially perverse consequences of its decisionmaking. [162]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As others have documented, and as we found in our interviews, agencies use a range of approaches to interact directly with regulated parties as they develop policy ideas. [165] Many of our respondents described proactive efforts to glean information about issues in the field, the effects of existing rules, and the probable effects of prospective policies from the public. [166] Numerous officials emphasized the importance of “invit[ing] public comment,” [167] holding “listening sessions or round tables” where an agency could “hear[] of the challenges of applying for the program,” [168] and getting input from numerous sources to ensure that agencies were “not advocates just for [particular interests]” but for “the public interest, the sweet spot somewhere in the middle.” [169] Such interactions often focused on a policy option’s real-world consequences: “The most useful stuff was . . . when someone in the regulat[ed] community would point out an impact that we hadn’t thought of.” [170] As one person put it, “[W]e use a [] multi-layered approach to rule making. . . . We may have a workshop. We may have a round table inviting in stakeholders from all elements. We do this as much to enlighten the staff . . . [as] to make it as open a process as possible.” [171] Others might “contract with some polling firms that would do questionnaires or do focus groups of beneficiaries, so we could understand what their challenges were with the [benefits] program” or do “a lot of surveillance activities for us to make sure that the programs are working.” [172]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The formal notice-and-comment process, of course, also brought outside opinions to the agency, and our study respondents painted a picture consistent with others’ conclusions that this aspect of rulemaking influences agency decisionmaking. As one respondent put it: “For a rule of any complexity, it would be very unusual for comments not to result in certain shifts.” [185] One agency, for instance, “was in a rush” to make a rule changing a medical reimbursement system “because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee at the time was very interested in” a particular new approach. [186] “[T]he public commenters just were uniformly opposed . . . , and then [the agency] didn’t adopt that system, and then a year later, [the agency] adopted . . . what I thought was a much better system in response to the public comments.” [187] Agencies also used comment periods creatively to float policy trial balloons gauging public reaction to a policy option: “[If we were] struggling with the best interpretation or whether we had authority or whatever, . . . we would sometimes directly ask for comments that built out a case for doing something, a statutory theory for doing something” for use in later policymaking. [188] “There were a lot of things where we sort of floated an idea [during a rule-making] . . . , got some stuff that felt useful, and then we were in a position to propose with a stronger . . . record” in a later rulemaking. [189] Agencies can utilize public input in this way by building on existing systems for assessing and responding to comments in rulemaking. [190]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Joining our research with the work of others yields a nuanced picture of agencies’ interactions with the public. On the one hand, agency information collection is often unsystematic and inefficient. And agency decisionmaking is often influenced most by well-resourced regulated industries serving their own economic interests. On the other hand, agencies can and often do convene a wide range of participants when formulating policy ideas. And they have personnel and systems in place for taking into account multiple diverse interests. Indeed, their capacity to incorporate and negotiate among pluralistic views in any given policy decision process probably outstrips that of other government institutions. As we discuss further in Part III, strengthening and channeling these pluralistic decisionmaking capacities would significantly enhance government’s democratic quality, a possibility that in turn underscores the serious costs of the current presidential administration’s efforts to dismantle bureaucratic capacity, as well as of recent Supreme Court doctrine that has been redistributing decisionmaking power to the far less accountable federal courts.

,,,,"Our interviewees consistently underscored that agency action often requires a catalyst—something that drives an agency to designate some phenomenon as a problem that warrants a policy response. [192] To a large extent, statutes leave it up to agencies to decide whether to address—and how to even identify—an issue under their purview. Presidential administrations and congressional oversight of course play significant roles in setting agencies’ overall regulatory agendas, especially in the modern context of centralized review. [193] But throughout our interviews, officials described an ongoing, ground-up form of working with statutes, grounded in their evaluation of workability. Our study thus shows how working with a statute intrinsically involves figuring out the real-world consequences of different implementation options, ensuring that decisions express not just theoretical preferences but workable goals so that the agency can effectively implement its policy choices. [194] An agency’s purposes and goals were often pragmatically, not abstractly, defined. [195] Interviewees were keenly aware that agencies do not act on their own: “Like a quarterback can throw the ball down the field, but better have someone [to] catch it.” [196] As we will explore in Part III, this consequentialist orientation comfortably suits an institution of governance in a democracy by helping to ensure that governance decisions are made not just in the abstract or on principle, but with due consideration for their effects on the governed population.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But agencies have complex, internally cross-cutting relations even with the seemingly single institution of Congress. First and foremost, the delegating or enacting Congress—and the governing coalition behind a statute—quickly recede into history after the next biennial election. [199] The bulk of agency work thus entails statutes enacted by past Congresses, even as that work is overseen and enabled by later Congresses, including through ongoing appropriations. [200] As we note in Part I, agencies balance their desire to “get along with Congress” with their duty of loyalty to a statutory regime that may well predate sitting lawmakers: “[Y]ou’re trying to be . . . a good steward to the program and adhere to the statute.” [201] Though our respondents identified and understood the preferences of existing members of Congress, they distinguished those from the imperatives of their statutes. “We kind of knew that [Congress was not] gonna be happy with us,” one official said of a particular program. [202] “We kind of knew that they were probably against it because either my Program Office or General Counsel had had at least some conversation with the committee . . . .

They plainly did not have . . . detailed familiarity with what the statute said . . . or what our brief under the statute was.” [210] Instead, discussions with Congress as reported by our respondents tended to be “much more general, which is, ‘Yeah, we want to [protect individuals from harms by an industry,] but we don’t want to kill the [industry].

So we’d be in touch with them at every stage through till the end.” [212] These interactions would involve “the leadership of the [Oversight] Committee, . . . Democratic and Republican staff. And to some degree with the individual members’ staff who had a particular interest in the issue.” [213] Another interviewee described some collaborative problem solving: “There are certain areas where Congress passed laws that frankly were almost impossible to implement, like the 100% screening requirement for cargo entering the United States.” [214] The relevant agencies had “gotten waivers from Congress year after year after year, just because it hasn’t been possible [to implement] for resource reasons, for all kinds of technical reasons.” [215] That led to creative negotiation with members of Congress: “If we’re going to do something to try and meet your goal on an interim basis, would this satisfy the committee?” [216]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Other respondents described situations in which “executive agencies hav[e] some reluctance to maybe allow Congress into the process, because their motivations were not necessarily the same as [the agency’s].” [217] For instance, an interviewee discussed a statute requiring the agency to “designate specific airports for [particular kinds of arrival screening].” [218] The law, which had been enacted decades earlier, evinced “no idea that you could have some kind of electronic submission of information for advanced screening at a central place,” so technological developments had made that law “out of date.” [219] But it still had an economic impact: Designated airports could benefit from increased commerce. [220] As U.S. foreign policy changed, “members of Congress were jockeying to . . . designate certain airports [under the statute] . . . , for purely economic and commercial reasons.” [221] The interviewee recalled, “[W]e’d look at them like they were aliens, like, ‘We’re sitting here trying to find a way to [improve screening for national security], and you’re going to try and use this old security law to force us to put it at your airport?’” [222] For agency officials, orienting their action around the statutory scheme provided a way to confront congressional capture by commercial interests or narrow constituencies. [223]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"That orientation also influenced how administrators interacted with individual members of Congress. “[I]t was very, very common,” one long-term administrator told us, that “Congress would enact some piece of legislation and maybe . . . [some legislators] were dissatisfied with what they drafted, and they wanted to do a . . . [p]ost-enactment reinterpretation of what they wanted . . . .” [224] This interviewee recalled a statute drafted to exclude a certain class of entity from public cost reporting—an exclusion designed to create cost savings. “I know [the statute was supposed to do] that because I was assisting the people who were drafting the bill and [were] trying [to] make sure the criteria would exclude [that kind of entity].” [225] These entities first learned about their exclusion late, when “the language couldn’t be changed.” [226] They “went complaining to” two Senators, who “had this colloquy on the floor to say” that the entities should be included in cost reporting after all. [227] That kind of colloquy, our respondent emphasized, “has zero meaning. . . . The agency can’t go based on what two Senators say on the floor of the Senate one month after the bill was enacted, in place of the . . . statutory language . . . . The agency is obligated to implement the statutory language that is passed by Congress.” [228]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Other scholars have found that congressional oversight hearings can “mov[e agency action] towards congressional preferences on issues ranging from the level of regulatory enforcement to the creation of programs that stretch agencies’ statutory authority.” [229] Appropriations committees can also exert significant influence. [230] Our respondents, however, did not recount all that much experience with congressional hearings. It may be that our respondents, many of whom were civil servants, were not closely connected to the leadership offices or offices of legislative affairs that would have dealt with oversight hearings on a regular basis. But the lack of discussion of oversight hearings could also reflect the fact that such hearings themselves are not the norm; hearings require a political choice on the part of members of Congress, somewhat costly in terms of “time constraints[,] opportunity costs, [and] informational demands.” [231] Either way, our study supports the conclusion that agency officials formulating policy and overseeing programs consider the views of members of the sitting Congress. But our research also suggests that officials incorporate congressional input to enhance the workability of their statutory regimes, giving primacy not to the opinions of particular legislators, but to what those statutory regimes require.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Political officials—the President, Cabinet secretaries, and the thousands of political appointees across the Executive Branch—play an important role in shaping how statutes work. We conducted our study well before the current presidential administration launched its radical efforts to control and remake the bureaucracy, and the conclusions we offer here do not account for the dramatic expansion of centralized control and apparent rejection of numerous statutory contraints currently underway. But our research does demonstrate that achieving workability long has required agencies to attend to the priorities and values of the political officials installed within agency leadership, as well as the directives, pressure, or requests for assistance that might come from the White House and the Executive Office of the President (EOP). After all, much of an agency’s actual decisionmaking authority rests in the hands of political officials. And regardless of the extent to which the President and White House can and should control agency action, EOP support remains vital to the success of many agency policies, including because of the entrenched practices of centralized OMB and OIRA review. That political officials’ priorities influence policymaking also demonstrates a form of democratic responsiveness within administration, allowing elections to have consequences. This influence can contribute to public acceptance and democratic legitimation—important aspects of workability, too.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Our interviews illuminate how the political layer that governs agencies shapes the production of statutory regimes. In describing this relationship here, we draw on other work, based on the same dataset, in which we analyze this set of political connections. [232] That work identifies three key features of the role political actors play in agencies’ work with statutes. First, the White House and the EOP play important, though hardly all-encompassing, roles in shaping agency policymaking. An administration may seek to centralize the implementation of a signature initiative within the EOP—a signal feature of the Obama administration’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act. [233] But, more often than not, White House involvement in agency policymaking is not “a top-down process displacing agency judgment . . . but rather . . . a collaborative and participatory process.” [234] Interviewees described White House attention not as demanding specific outcomes, but as requiring exhaustive consideration, explanation, and documentation from regulators.

,,,,"Second, the transmission of presidential priorities across the state does not typically come from clear pronouncements by the President himself. In practice, presidential influence tends to be diffuse and general rather than direct or specific. [236] It is really more appropriate to speak in terms of political rather than presidential control, as the influence of an administration depends a great deal on the particular priorities of the political officials who occupy positions of authority within agencies [237] and who enter office with their own policy ideas and personal backgrounds, connected to a thick network of political operatives, civil-society groups, and other sources. [238]",,0,html_body_unmatched

[243] Our study illuminates a different and typically ignored perspective on judicial review: agency officials’ own conceptions of courts as decisionmakers and authority figures.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In the actual assessment of litigation risk, an agency’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) loomed large. Many of our interviewees described their reliance on their lawyerly hubs for guidance on the risk/reward tradeoff of policymaking. As one non-attorney told us about sub-regulatory guidance, “Are we thinking about litigation when we write the guidance? No, I think we’re thinking about offering a blueprint [for regulated parties], but the Office of General Counsel is looking at it and saying, okay, what could come back to haunt us.” [260] As another interviewee explained, OGC’s risk assessment might then occasion negotiation with and among subject-matter experts about whether it was worth proceeding with the planned policy. “It’s hard to say who decided in those cases ’cause we would . . . talk about it for a long time, and eventually someone would back down. So, if [OGC thought] something carried a lot [of] litigation risk, then they would continue saying that . . . , and we would move towards a decision.” [261]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Beyond its strategic dimension, litigation also appeared to offer our subjects a learning opportunity, independent of courts’ final decisions. Some of our interviewees described litigation as pushing the agency to reconsider its approach. [271] Where a regulated party behaves in ways not foreseen by a regulation or makes arguments the agency did not anticipate, the agency (and potentially the DOJ) must develop a response. One attorney described a situation “where an [industry] operator has raised a legitimate interpretive question, or sort of real-world question about what our interpretation means, and we’re kind of trying to interact with [the policy making part of the agency] about, ‘Is this really a position you want us to defend?,’” or “Is there guidance that you want to put out that would sort of preserve our interpretation but handle the particular troublesome problem that the operator has raised?” [272] Another interviewee described a situation in which the agency “delved deeper into the regulatory provisions than perhaps we did when we were drafting them, because the litigants were in some measure raising arguments that we hadn’t encountered before.” [273]",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But litigation, and the assessment of litigation risk, can also turn into a form of public participation in policymaking, underscoring one conventional account of the judicial review provisions of the APA—that they enable public monitoring of agencies through litigants’ identification of policy flaws. [274] Litigation can alert agencies when regulations might not cohere with reality or with other policies, and provide another way for affected publics to push regulators to take their views into account. Examples like those we heard in our interviews highlight agencies’ intimate connections to the world they regulate and the pragmatic, problem-solving nature of agencies’ work with statutes. Agency officials thus develop strategies for avoiding and surviving contest in the courts; in the process, they negotiate among the competing demands expressed in litigation. These negotiations occur as part of their duty to produce workable statutory regimes.",,0,html_body_unmatched

But our work suggests that, despite these shortcomings, enervating agency discretion and capacity, as the sitting Supreme Court doctrine and the current presidential administration both seem set on doing, would actually undermine crucial functions of our system of government. Our findings thus have important implications for legal scholarship, the study of democratic institutions, and doctrinal and political debates over the scope and future of the administrative state. This research also helps us to identify how agencies can be made better, more accountable institutions.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Our findings suggest that textualism and purposivism, with their attendant canons and rules, are simply not that helpful for understanding how agencies work with statutes. Our interviewees certainly considered both texts and purposes, often in differentiated ways depending on their agencies’ internal divisions of labor. But text and purpose were just two factors of many, some of which the prescriptive theories do not recognize and cannot account for. [282] Courts’ interpretive theories are tied up with the countermajoritarian difficulty, and their canons of interpretation rest on (often inaccurate) heuristics about the legislative process. [283] Agencies, authorized by statutory delegations and intimately familiar with legislative production, have other concerns. Even interviewees familiar with judicial tenets did not claim to be guided by them, except to the extent adherence to those tenets might prove necessary to ensure that agency policy could withstand judicial review: These tenets do not help agencies address the issues that statutes place within their purview. As our discussion suggests, agencies cannot accurately be described as textualist, purposivist, or an eclectic mix of the two. They do something different that needs to be studied on its own terms. Indeed, our agency-focused perspective ultimately gives us insight into what goes on inside the bureaucracy and how statutory enactments come to have effects—insights necessary to any efforts to enhance agency accountability and crucial for evaluating the separation of powers and the demands of modern government.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Even for juricentric scholarship, our insights should raise new questions. It may well be that certain judicial models or theories are preferable to the practices we have uncovered, or that courts should continue what they’re doing irrespective of what we learn about how agencies work with statutes. Perhaps the limited accountability and policy expertise of courts makes them uniquely ill-suited to engage in the sort of consequentialist decisionmaking we have described. But as we explore in more detail in subpart III(C) below, that assumption would still be compatible with (and might even require) deferential judicial review. To some readers with a more juricentric orientation, the divergence we document might suggest that it is agencies that should change. But why should we assume that courts and their particular methods of discerning statutory meaning hold pride of place in interpreting statutes that Congress charges agencies with effectuating? The courts’ divergence from agency models demands justification.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In its recent decision overruling Chevron , the Court provides an answer to this demand—interpreting statutes is just what courts do, they answer legal questions. But this observation is entirely conclusory, and our work shows why effectuating statutes by giving meaning to their texts cannot be reduced to acontextual “legal” question answering. Scholars need not make the same baseless assumptions as the Roberts Court—that agencies have no special expertise in interpreting statutes. It is arguably a burden of the juricentric scholar to explain why courts rather than agencies should play the leading role in ensuring that congressional will has been followed. No matter how hard the Supreme Court insists that agencies have no expertise when it comes to interpreting statutes, agency officials will continue doing so—their job within our system of government requires it.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"More importantly, we think it both unrealistic and undesirable to demand that Congress constantly legislate anew. Such a burden would quickly outstrip congressional capacity and exceed the limits of a reasonable legislative agenda. [297] Members of Congress are generalists with limited staffs facing regular elections while governing an enormously complex economy and society. [298] Congress as a whole lacks the diversified expertise of the agencies it creates. [299] Individual members of Congress, concerned with their geographic constituencies or donors, lack both the incentives and the institutional capacity to undertake the kind of broad consultation characteristic of agency work. [300] Our findings suggest that several key features of agencies—specified focus, divisions of labor, multiple ongoing communication channels, and attenuated dependence on elections—allow them to engage in ongoing policy development through deliberation and interaction with relevant parties and publics in a way that Congress and its members simply cannot. Agencies thus possess a clear comparative advantage when addressing day-to-day problems and evolving demands for government action. We can, of course, point to instances in which new legislation would be far more effective at addressing novel challenges than regulation under old statutes. But that does not mean that Congress can or should legislate each time change is required. To base a theory of administrative power on that assumption is glib at best.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The idea that agencies co-create statutory meaning through practical implementation may raise concerns that agencies will distend statutes, manipulating them to achieve idiosyncratic policy objectives not contemplated or desired by elected officials. [308] And indeed, we do not mean to suggest that agencies always produce desirable or even workable programs, nor that agency policymaking through existing statutory frameworks will always be preferable to fresh congressional action. Sometimes agency action will be insufficient to address new problems precisely because old laws addressed to old problems do not provide the requisite legal authority, or because old statutory regimes are simply too disconnected from an emergent reality to function well. [309] Agency decisions can also be inefficient, misguided, distorted by ideological objectives, and as neglectful of society’s disadvantaged as the U.S. Code itself.

,,,,"Contemporary Supreme Court jurisprudence is in stark tension with the conception of agencies’ role that we have just offered, increasingly placing courts at the statutory helm. Take Chevron deference. Even before the Court overruled Chevron during its 2023 Term, the Court had mostly abandoned the doctrinal regime that instructs courts to accept reasonable agency understandings of open-ended statutory terms. [322] Courts that have either ignored or eschewed Chevron deference often have painted themselves as returning power usurped by the agency back to Congress. [323] In fact, though, such moves undermine Congress, negating its ability to decide who should effectuate its statutes. [324] Courts operating in this vein effectively claim for themselves the power to decide how regulatory statutes should be effectuated—decisions that, as we have noted, they have comparatively less capacity than agencies to make. These most recent decisions only promise to heighten the agency risk aversion we bring to light in Part II, which almost certainly will slow policymaking down. This very result may be precisely what Chevron ’s foes have in mind, but it simply underscores how recent doctrinal developments increasingly put the judiciary in charge of how—and whether—statutes can have concrete meaning in the world.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The systemic understanding of statutory implementation we offer, and the concomitant critique of existing doctrine, do not mean that courts have no meaningful role to play in overseeing the administrative state. On the contrary, courts ought to recognize the key functions agencies serve in our democracy and push agencies to play their role well. We have shown, for instance, that agencies have the capacity to engage in regular pluralistic contestation about specific policy choices over time. Courts should acknowledge that competence and encourage agencies to use it. The drive to eliminate Chevron rests on the contention that courts are best positioned to identify a statute’s true, or best, meaning. [331] But as our discussion here indicates, regulatory statutes often have no objectively best meaning; judges who find one without accounting for differentiated effects, competing interests, and workability considerations will often merely substitute their personal ideas for an agency’s more informed, pluralistic process—one that also has the benefit of congressional authorization.

We offer an alternative approach to judicial review for the future—one that entails a more radical appreciation of agency work than even Chevron itself. When confronted with an agency interpretation of a statute, a court should ask whether the statutory regime supports the agency’s view of what the statute authorizes. In other words, we would not return to the so-called step 1 of Chevron and the idea that courts should attempt to use all of the tools of statutory construction to determine whether a statute is ambiguous. The pervasively open-ended nature of statutes means that, in many cases, such analysis is little more than an opportunity for judges to incorporate their own intuitions into their supposedly legalistic practice. And the varied means by which agencies implement statutes underscore that determining a statute’s meaning removed from context belies the very thing statutes are for—to provide frameworks for policy or action .",,0,html_body_unmatched

Given how agencies work with statutes, they should not have to consider all conceivable policy options, nor eliminate all uncertainty about a policy’s likely effects. [336] Policymaking is inevitably, and appropriately, informed by value judgments, which can provide adequate foundation for agency policy, including policy changes within an unchanged statutory regime. Judicial review should not seek to ferret out or eradicate such normative orientations, or require an agency to be so comprehensive in its policy work that it becomes sluggish at best, but should focus instead on whether a policy lacks a reasonable foundation or appears to result from untested whims.

The lower courts, confronted with new challenges to agency policymaking based on open-ended statutory language, may begin to develop the sort of deference regime we describe above.

None claimed—or even claimed to strive for—the kind of neutrality sometimes attributed to idealized administration. In our view, this open acceptance of normative, political considerations is a strength, as is agencies’ concern about consequences. The implementation of statutes involves choices that inevitably distribute public goods and constraints unevenly; there is no neutral outcome. Claims to neutrality only obfuscate the value judgments and political considerations that inevitably attend statutory effectuation. The agency practices we present here do not eliminate the possibility of inequitable, unjust, or unwise outcomes. [341] But they provide opportunities for ameliorating them.

Bernstein & Rodríguez, supra note 31, at 371 (arguing that the Constitution and the government it authorizes “should be understood as making room for—perhaps even requiring—a workable government”). A formalistic interpretation of the Constitution might support an alternative conclusion aimed at constraining unelected bureaucrats. That approach, however, ignores the fact that our current government itself emerged through constitutional processes over time. Claims about returning government to a design conceptualized in the past thus present a normative plea, not a constitutional command.
