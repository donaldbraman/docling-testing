1,THE OLD REGIME AND THE LOPER BRIGHT ' REVOLUTION ',section_header,body_text,"But it is already possible to see how Loper Bright both grew out of pre-existing legal doctrines, principles, and trends, and also to see how the chastening of the Loper Bright revolution could occur, leaving in place much of the old Chevron regime under different labels. Indeed, I will argue, the beginning of that process is already visible within the four corners of the majority opinion itself. Writing for the Court, its leading Girondin or moderate revolutionary, the Chief Justice, already attempts to temper the Loper Bright revolution, writing a roadmap for a broad recharacterization of “ Chevron deference” as “ Loper Bright delegation.” 10 In some potentially broad range of the cases that would previously have been covered by the Chevron doctrine, courts will now say that Congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated discretionary policymaking authority to the agencies. In this framework, much of the review of the outer bounds of agency discretion that previously took place under the Chevron label will take place under the label of arbitrary-and-capricious review, but it is at best unclear how much will change in any operative sense, especially given that Chevron and arbitrariness review have long been held to overlap in part. 11 Furthermore, even apart from delegation, the Chief Justice’s opinion for the Court leaves in place a robust Skidmore doctrine of “respect” for persuasive agency interpretations; 12 it also backhandedly confirms the idea associated with NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc. that courts owe agencies a form of deference as to “mixed questions,” or the application of legal standards to facts, which is a form of policymaking discretion. 13 It is difficult, at least in the abstract, to identify with certainty any clear category of cases that will come out differently under the new regime than under the old one.",,75.0,matched

The Law of, and After, Loper Bright",section_header,body_text,"Overall, taken together with what seems to be the continuing validity of Skidmore and Hearst , I suspect that there is less to Loper Bright than meets the eye. Even after Loper Bright there is a rather large domain in which courts that would have deferred under Chevron can still defer, just with a different legal framework. Of course it is true that, we may confidently expect, at least some cases will come out differently than under the Chevron regime. But the Chevron regime was itself heavily qualified by the time of its demise, and agencies and courts had for some time been used to avoiding it or at least not putting too much reliance on it. And as we have seen, there is much more continuity across the triptych of Chevron , Mead , and Loper Bright than initially appears. Delegation is a central concept in all three, and all three acknowledge that—within whatever fairly loose boundaries the constitutional nondelegation doctrine allows—Congress may “delegate” or grant to agencies a legal space within which to create binding rules, whether through rulemaking or adjudication. The task of the judge, in all three decisions, is to determine the outer boundaries of the relevant delegations. If Loper Bright now describes that task as determining the one right answer to statutory meaning, that is more a façon de parler than an about-face.",,71.7948717948718,matched

Even after Loper Bright there is a rather large domain in which courts that would have deferred under Chevron can still defer, just with a different legal framework. Of course it is true that, we may confidently expect, at least some cases will come out differently than under the Chevron regime. But the Chevron regime was itself heavily qualified by the time of its demise, and agencies and courts had for some time been used to avoiding it or at least not putting too much reliance on it. And as we have seen, there is much more continuity across the triptych of Chevron , Mead , and Loper Bright than initially appears.

Part III examines the main proposal of the Court’s Jacobins de droite , who would revive the nondelegation doctrine as a constitutional matter, and argues that such a revival is both unlikely to occur and likely to be surprisingly inconsequential even if it does occur.

Part II lays out the main holdings of Loper Bright , details the thesis that the decision may change much less than might initially appear, and examines some of the many doctrinal questions raised and left open by the decision. In particular, I examine the possibility of interaction effects with the Court’s other recent decisions on administrative law, and I suggest that those effects will not do much to exacerbate the effect of Loper Bright , in part because they cut in countervailing directions. Part III examines the main proposal of the Court’s Jacobins de droite , who would revive the nondelegation doctrine as a constitutional matter, and argues that such a revival is both unlikely to occur and likely to be surprisingly inconsequential even if it does occur. I conclude that the anti-administrative revolution, dramatic though it may appear to those of us who are living through it, is likely to be at most a marginal revolution—a mild and perhaps temporary correction to the “market” for administrative authority.

Whatever happens in the next year, or /uniFB01 ve years, I believe that a few decades on, one will look back and say: so too with Chevron and Loper Bright .",text,body_text,"Tocqueville’s account of his times, however, supplies a more apt “grand narrative” 113 for our times. What it captures, and what the stock market analogy fails to capture, is the sheer ideological passion of many of the participants in the conservative-libertarian legal movement—the patent fact that many of Chevron ’s critics in the bar and the academy, and some of the Justices who voted to overrule Chevron , are gripped by no less than a kind of revolutionary fervor for “anti-administrativism.” 114 And the narrative parallel is only enhanced when we realize that among the Justices who voted to overrule Chevron are some, like the Chief Justice and perhaps to a lesser degree Justice Kavanaugh, who play the part of more moderate revolutionaries, and who seem to have tried to preempt the Jacobins de droite from taking things too far. It is very much an open question in the short run whether the moderates will succeed in arresting the course of the revolution, taking it so far and no farther. One recalls that the original Girondins ended up beneath the blade. But Tocqueville’s whole point, his striking thesis, is that whether or not the moderate revolutionaries succeed or, as in his case, fail, nonetheless in the longer run the Revolution merely served to reinforce and consolidate the order against which it rebelled. The laws and customs of the ancien régime were reintroduced in new forms and under new labels.

,,,,"In a case involving an agency, of course, the statute’s meaning may well be that the agency is authorized to exercise a degree of discretion. Congress has often enacted such statutes. For example, some statutes expressly delegate to an agency the authority to give meaning to a particular term. Others empower an agency to prescribe rules to fill up the details of a statutory scheme, or to regulate subject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that leaves agencies with flexibility, such as “appropriate” or “reasonable.” When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional delegations, “fix[ing] the boundaries of [the] delegated authority,” H. Monaghan, Marbury and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 27 (1983), and ensuring the agency has engaged in reasoned decisionmaking within those boundaries. By doing so, a court upholds the traditional conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts. 44",,0,html_body_unmatched
