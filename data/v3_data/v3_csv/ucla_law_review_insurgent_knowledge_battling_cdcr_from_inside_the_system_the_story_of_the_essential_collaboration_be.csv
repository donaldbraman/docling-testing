3,"Overview of California's Inmate Classification System. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) uses an inmate classification system to assign inmates to different housing security levels and varying degrees of supervision during their daily activities. Assignment to a housing security level is generally based on inmates' assessed risk of misconduct-referred to as their 'housing score.' The performance of the inmate classification system has implications for the safety of staff, inmates, and the public; prison operations and cost; the size of the inmate population; and inmates' daily experiences in prison, including their access to rehabilitation opportunities.",text,text,,,57.14285714285714,unmatched

3,"Accuracy of Housing Score Could Be Limited. We identified several factors that call into question the accuracy of CDCR's housing score methodology. Specifically, we found that: (1) CDCR has modified the methodology without reassessing its accuracy, (2) several changes-such as to the demographics of the inmate population-could have caused its accuracy to deteriorate since it was first established, and (3) there is some evidence that the methodology underweights age.

5,"Prevent Inmate Escape and Misconduct. One of the primary challenges facing prison systems is preventing escape and misconduct, which can range from crimes (such as murder, assault, and drug trafficking) to more minor violations of prison rules (such as misuse of food or unexcused absence from a work assignment). Inmate classification systems are commonly employed prison management tools that allow prison officials to allocate security resources according to inmates' likelihood of escape or misconduct. These systems typically involve procedures to identify inmates with a high incentive for escape or risk factors that make them statistically more likely to engage in misconduct. This allows prison officials to place such inmates in more secure environments.",text,body_text,Id.,,100.0,matched
5,"It is important to place inmates in the appropriate security setting for several reasons. On the one hand, placing inmates in a setting with insufficient security could jeopardize the safety of staff, other inmates, and the public. On the other hand, placing inmates in an overly restrictive setting can create other significant problems. For example, it can create a long-term public safety risk by making implications for state costs. Moreover, because the system determines where and how inmates are housed and supervised, it significantly affects the daily experiences of individual inmates. In addition, because housing and supervision placements can affect inmates' abilities to earn credits that reduce their prison terms, the classification system can affect how long some inmates ultimately spend in prison.

For example, the system allocates the same amount of points to an inmate likely to engage in serious misconduct (such as assault) as an inmate likely to engage in minor misconduct (such as use of vulgar language) and may not require additional security resources. Accordingly, CDCR may be assigning unnecessary security to inmates who are prone to engage in minor misconduct, but not in serious misconduct. This approach is inconsistent with CDCR's goals because it may result in inmates who do not represent a serious safety concern being placed in more restrictive settings than necessary.

If the system incorrectly assesses certain inmates as having relatively high risks of misconduct, these inmates could be placed in more restrictive housing than necessary. Such a placement potentially threatens public safety as it could make inmates more prone to crime.

13,"Impact of Modification Made to Scoring Methodology Has Not Been Assessed. As discussed above, the underlying basis of the department's current methodology for calculating inmates' housing scores when they first arrive in prison was established in the early 2000s by researchers at UCLA. In 2008, in response to a lawsuit, CDCR removed mental illness from the set of factors that increased inmates' scores.

13,"Several Changes Could Have Impacted Accuracy of Methodology. The researchers who established CDCR's current housing score methodology in the early 2000s used data on the conduct and characteristics of inmates from the late 1990s. Accordingly, the current system effectively assigns risk scores to current inmates based on how similar they are to inmates that engaged in misconduct in the 1990s. For example, because the researchers found that inmates in the late 1990's who were first arrested at a young age were more likely to engage in misconduct, the system assigns higher risk scores to current inmates who share this characteristic. However, any changes in the underlying relationships between these characteristics and misconduct may have caused the accuracy of the assessment to deteriorate over time. For example, if inmates who were first arrested at a young age no longer engage in misconduct at higher rates than other inmates, this would cause the accuracy of the assessment to decrease. Experts who study risk assessments designed to predict outcomes for a certain population generally recommend reassessing the accuracy of such tools whenever there are significant changes in the population for which the tool is used.",text,body_text,Id.at 4.,,71.42857142857143,matched

Before reaching the threshold at which point a pro per petitioner is appointed representation, prisoners are plagued by unrealistic disparities in accessing the court system. Many prisoners do not read and write English and lack knowledge of the legal system. Those with this acumen have to overcome substantial legislative barriers such as the vague and burdensome Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) requirements andCDCRbarriers such as limited access to the law library, confiscation of legal books and documents, and other forms of retaliation by correctional officers designed to intimidate prisoners to abandon their efforts.

Specifically, the researchers found that they were able to better predict inmate misconduct using inmates' housing scores and age than by using their housing score alone. This suggests that, even though housing score methodology is intended to include the effect of age on the likelihood of misconduct, it does not give a strong enough weight to age relative to the other factors.

As such, it is unclear whether the factors that CDCR uses to move inmates' score up and down after their initial placement accurately reflect changes in inmates' risk of misconduct.

,,,,"During this time, Mike and I had begun addressingCDCR’s use of racial segregation[23]to effectuate double celling of prisoners at a time when San Quentin was so overcrowded that beds were housed in the gymnasium, chapels, and on tiers—called “broadways.”CDCRcircumvented the need for interviews to determine whether cellies were compatible and substituted race as the primary determinant for pairing up prisoners in a cell. This policy also facilitated the use of race-based punishment and lockdowns. Mike filed a claim in Marin County protesting this classification system and the strict racial segregation it caused, and later obtained the assistance of another ally, attorney Charles Carbone, who represented me at my parole hearing at which I was found suitable for release in 2012. I filed a civil rights action in federal court in the Northern District of California and settled withCDCR, which changed my racial classification category from “White” to “Other” based on my Lithuanian-Turkish ancestry. I objected to being classified as “White” due to my Jewish heritage and the resulting, involuntary segregation into a group that espoused white supremacy and used swastikas. Ephraim Margolin and later James Brosnahan of Morrison & FoersterLLPtook on this case in the Northern District. Brosnahan graciously represented me at my early parole hearings and later won a decision in federal court holding that there was no evidence of unsuitability at my 2009 Board hearing where I was denied parole. Judge Wilken ordered a new hearing, holding that, in the absence of additional evidence, I was to be found suitable.[24]While the case was on appeal in the Ninth Circuit,[25]the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no federally protected interest in parole.[26]So I focused on doing everything within my control to be found suitable for parole by the Board. By 2009, the Board was finding more lifers in San Quentin as suitable for parole and the governor was increasingly allowing them to keep these hearing dates and go home.[27]Freedom seemed attainable.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Sterling won habeas petitions releasing several lifers based on his thorough petitions which documented the positive programming and evidence of rehabilitation of the petitioner.

Hector gained legal and administrative knowledge from the Prisoner’s Self-help Litigation Manual.[29]Hector was selfless in helping others who lacked literacy or legal knowledge and he acquired a “free legal education” by serving fellow San Quentin lifers in challenging Board denials. Hector required any lifer who he helped to complete self-help programming and show remorse and responsibility for the crime committed. With those requirements met, he could argue to the court that the prisoner did not pose a current threat of dangerousness and met the conditions for parole suitability. These protests against the Board of Parole Hearings by the San Quentin lifers served as a call for justice by presenting prisoners who were eligible for parole, exposing the Board’s standardized denials lacking individualized consideration, and opposing the violation of prisoners’ fundamental rights. Their efforts brought freedom to some and hope to many.

As a consequence of a life sentence, prisoners will begin their term in maximum-security Level IV institutions, which are dominated by gang and racial violence and where access to self-help programming is scant due to frequent lockdowns in response to violence. Many of these institutions are plagued with systemic racism from correctional staff, who even foment violence among prisoners.

The vicissitudes of prison life and life after parole have spared me. For most of my three decades inCDCR(formerlyCDC), the purpose of prison was punishment.[33]Rehabilitation became an added objective of theCDC’s mission in 2005,[34]but prison yards and the mindset of correctional staff did not fundamentally shift.
