3,"Since its inception in the English common law and equity courts, the fair use doctrine has never ceased to fascinate theorists and students. 3 The existence of the doctrine raised two critical challenges for scholars.

Second,  why should  fair  users  be  fully  relieved  of  the  duty  to  compensate  copyright owners?",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
3,"The  answer  to  both  these  questions  has  been  provided  by  Professor Wendy Gordon. In a pathbreaking article authored almost forty years ago, Gordon conceptualized fair use as a means for overcoming a market failure in the form of high transaction costs. 4 Gordon persuasively argued that courts should recognize fair use when three cumulative conditions obtain: first, high transaction  costs  prevent  voluntary  market  exchange  between  copyright owners and users; second, the allegedly fair use is socially beneficial; and, third, a fair use finding would not unduly undermine incentives to create. 5 Gordon's key insight was that when transaction costs are prohibitive, there will  be  no  voluntary  trade  between  copyright  owners  and  users.  In  this scenario, allowing users to use copyright content for free benefits the user without harming copyright owners, for the latter would not be able to collect payments from users as transaction costs bar voluntary exchanges. Gordon correctly  submitted  that  under  these  circumstances,  allowing  users  to  use copyright  content  for  free,  by  classifying  their  use  as  fair,  is  welfare enhancing.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

In Kelly , the Ninth Circuit ruled that the public display of photographs in the form of thumbnails as part of the operation of a visual search engine constituted fair use. 58 In reaching this conclusion, the court mentioned  the  benefit  conferred  on  the  public  by  the  appellee's  search engine. 59 Approximately  four  years  later,  in  2007,  in Perfect  10,  Inc.  v. Amazon.com, Inc. , the Ninth Circuit was asked to revisit the issue, when an adult content company sued Google, alleging that its authorized display of its  copyrighted  photos  as  thumbnails  in  response  to  users'  searches constituted copyright infringement. 60 Finding that Google's use was fair, the Ninth Circuit emphasized the 'significant public benefit' of Google's search system, explaining:",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Under these circumstances, allowing the student to quote the manuscript without permission would make them (and society at large) better off without harming the author.

17,"Gordon's approach grounded fair use in economic theory, proving that the doctrine can be welfare enhancing when applied properly. However, the tie Gordon created between fair use and high transaction costs has proven to be a double-edged sword. As the title of her article, Fair Use as a Market Failure suggests,  Gordon  justified  fair  use  as  a  means  of  overcoming  a market failure in the form of high transaction costs. This was a great strength of  Gordon's  theory,  but  also  a  potential  weakness.  Critically,  Gordon's theory established a direct correlation between the level of transaction costs and the cases in which fair use should be recognized. The problem is that improvements  in  telecommunications  and  computer  technologies  have dramatically lowered transaction costs since Gordon published her article in 1982, putting a lot of strain on Gordon's theory. Critics of Gordon's theory suggested that in an interconnected world, fair use has outlived its 'raison d'être' and all uses must be secured via payment. 92 It bears emphasis that Gordon responded to her critics by broadening and sharpening the role of market failure in her account. Yet, Gordon's account remains inextricably related  to  the  concept  of  market  failure,  and  it  conceives  fair  use  as  a mechanism that operates in non-transactional settings, i.e., settings in which voluntary transactions are vitiated. 93",text,body_text,World,,100.0,matched

Then, for each use, he calls on courts to design what can be called an 'efficiency ratio,' with the numerator representing the profit an author could realize if fair use is denied and the denominator representing the loss to society if the copyright owner refuses to license the work. 98 A high efficiency ratio suggests, per Fisher, that the use is probably unfair, while a low one indicates that the use is fair. 99 Fisher sets the cutoff at the use with the highest marginal aggregate social gain  (gain  to  society  from  creation  minus  loss  to  society  from  monopoly control over uses). 100 As Fisher himself admits, his approach to analyzing fair use, at least with respect to some sorts of works, 'is nearly coterminus [sic] with economic analysis of the copyright system as a whole.' 101 Fisher likewise acknowledges that his approach is probably impractical in light of the informational burden it imposes on judges. 102",text,body_text,0,,100.0,matched

Parodic use, for example, was tautologically defined by the Supreme Court as anything that may be reasonably perceived as a parody. 163 The concept of transformative use has likewise eluded any consistent  definition, 164 and  the  'public  benefit'  test,  to  which  courts increasingly reference, is inherently uninformative. 165 All of this implies that even when the user possesses a strong claim, fair use protection is hardly guaranteed. Nor can it be completely ruled out even in the presence of users with  relatively  weak  claims.  In  its  current  conception  as  a  quintessential standard, therefore, the user and the owner confront a given probability that fair use will be recognized. But as noted earlier, this probability-created by the malleable, open-ended environment in which fair use determinations are being  made-may render a user's threat of resorting to unauthorized use credible, which in turn creates a favorable bargaining framework that allows them to secure authorization with reduced licensing fees.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Users may reasonably subscribe to the latter.

In this scenario, allowing users to use copyright content for free benefits the userwithout harmingcopyright owners, for the latter would not be able to collect payments from users as transaction costs bar voluntary exchanges.

His method allowed him to pierce the judicial rhetoric and examine which statutory factors are outcome determinative in fair use cases. In his 2008 article, which surveyed the opinions from all fair use cases issued between 1978 and 2005, Beebe noted that “[i]t appears . . . that courts and commentators have exaggerated the influence of transformativeness doctrine on our fair use case law.”However, in his 2020 article that analyzed the opinions from all fair use cases issued between 2005 and 2019, Beebe reports that “while the transformativeness test appeared to be waning in influence by 2005, it has since recovered its previous level of influence, even in the lower-profile, workaday fair use opinions that make up the majority of the data.”Along similar lines, Clark Asay, Arielle Sloan and Dean Sobczak have empirically established that if courts perceive a certain use as transformative, it would almost invariably qualify for fair use protection, which implies that transformativeness is essentially a sufficient condition for enjoying the fair use defense.These recent findings suggest an important confluence between judicial rhetoric and reality.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Issued in May 2023, the ruling is the first application of fair use in the arts and entertainment industry since the 1994Campbellruling. TheWarholcase involves a series of Prince’s photos taken by photographer Lynn Goldsmith in 1981 to accompany a Vanity Fair article concerning Prince.Unbeknownst to Goldsmith, the magazine solicited Andy Warhol to create a stylized painted version of the photograph that became known as the “Orange Prince” silkscreen.Vanity Fair published the Orange Prince portrait in its November 1984 edition, and Goldsmith was co-credited for this work.Orange Prince, however, was only one of sixteen painted versions created by Warhol, collectively known as Warhol’s “Prince Series.”Pursuant to its completion, the Prince Series has been routinely displayed in museums and galleries.After Prince’s passing in 2016, Condé Nast, the official publisher of Vanity Fair, published a commemorative magazine entitled “The Genius of Prince,” with the Orange Prince portrait embellishing its cover.Alleging copyright infringement, Goldsmith argued that notwithstanding her initial 1984 licensing agreement with Condé Nast to use her photo one time as an “artistic reference,” she was unaware of the Orange Prince silkscreen—as well as of the Prince Series at large—until its reintroduction as part of the commemorative 2016 edition.",,0,html_body_unmatched

It should be emphasized at the outset that our goal is not to discredit other theories or even criticize them. As we will show, our theory of fair use complements existing theories by elucidating a central function of fair use that has hitherto evaded other scholars. The goal of the proceeding discussion is twofold: first, we wish to map the theoretical landscape of fair use, so we can precisely locate our own theory within it. Second, we seek to show how our justification of fair use interacts with the extant theoretic literature.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The most dominant theory has been put forth by Wendy Gordon.In an immensely influential article, Gordon argued that the fair use doctrine is a mechanism for allowing the use of copyrighted content when voluntary transactions between copyright owners and users are barred by high transaction costs.Specifically, Gordon postulated that fair use should be recognized when three cumulative conditions are met: (1) high transaction costs prevent consensual bargaining between copyright owners and users; (2) the unauthorized use is socially desirable; and (3) legitimizing the disputed use would not undermine incentives to create.",,0,html_body_unmatched

However, transaction costs—defined as the cost of identifying the counterparty to the transaction, negotiating and formalizing an agreement with them, and enforcing the agreement—would bar the exchange from taking place. Under these circumstances, allowing the student to quote the manuscript without permission would make them (and society at large) better off without harming the author. The author, in our example, could not receive payment from the student, not because they refused to pay, but rather owing to the fact that the level of transaction costs made payment impossible. Hence, the author stands to lose nothing if the student’s use is considered fair and the student receives a benefit of $20. Society, too, is benefitted by the award of fair use to the student since the realm of creativity is enriched, while incentives to create future works are not harmed.",,0,html_body_unmatched

However, the tie Gordon created between fair use and high transaction costs has proven to be a double-edged sword. As the title of her article,Fair Use as a Market Failuresuggests, Gordon justified fair use as a means of overcoming a market failure in the form of high transaction costs. This was a great strength of Gordon’s theory, but also a potential weakness. Critically, Gordon’s theory established a direct correlation between the level of transaction costs and the cases in which fair use should be recognized. The problem is that improvements in telecommunications and computer technologies have dramatically lowered transaction costs since Gordon published her article in 1982, putting a lot of strain on Gordon’s theory. Critics of Gordon’s theory suggested that in an interconnected world, fair use has outlived its “raison d’être” and all uses must be secured via payment.It bears emphasis that Gordon responded to her critics by broadening and sharpening the role of market failure in her account. Yet, Gordon’s account remains inextricably related to the concept of market failure, and it conceives fair use as a mechanism that operates in non-transactional settings, i.e., settings in which voluntary transactions are vitiated.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The first, associated with William Fisher, calls on courts to use fair use to promote the goals of copyright protections.To this end, Fisher asks courts to think of all possible uses of copyrighted works. Then, for each use, he calls on courts to design what can be called an “efficiency ratio,” with the numerator representing the profit an author could realize if fair use is denied and the denominator representing the loss to society if the copyright owner refuses to license the work.A high efficiency ratio suggests, per Fisher, that the use is probably unfair, while a low one indicates that the use is fair.Fisher sets the cutoff at the use with the highest marginal aggregate social gain (gain to society from creation minus loss to society from monopoly control over uses).As Fisher himself admits, his approach to analyzing fair use, at least with respect to some sorts of works, “is nearly coterminus [sic] with economic analysis of the copyright system as a whole.”Fisher likewise acknowledges that his approach is probably impractical in light of the informational burden it imposes on judges.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Each group was given the uses which it values most. Accordingly, authors received “standard commercial uses,” while the public received “uses of highly dispersed social value,”such as political speech, and uses that promote the pursuit of science, knowledge and truth.By contrast to Fisher’s theory of fair use, which requires courts to make individual case-by-case determinations of fair use, the dual-grant theory calls on courts to make fair use determinations based on the category of uses to which the challenged use belongs.

The existence of the fair use doctrine, thus, dramatically empowers users vis-à-vis copyright owners. This implies that Ella’s threat of using Francine’s work without permission becomes credible: if Francine’s asking price would exceed $5,000, Ella would walk off the negotiation table and use the work without authorization. This is because any asking price that crosses this threshold makes her benefit from authorization less than $3,000, which should lead her to refuse to pay this amount and, instead, use the work without authorization.

Users’ BATNA essentially depends on the feasibility of the third alternative. Herein lies the significance of fair use. Fair use bestows upon users the power to credibly threat to use copyrighted content without authorization and thereby leads rightsholders to adjust their asking price downwards. A world without fair use, by contrast, would allow any rightsholder to prevail in an infringement suit against any unauthorized user, which obviates the user’s third alternative.

As a result, certain welfare-enhancing transactions that would have occurred in a competitive market would not take place under monopolistic pricing.To illustrate, suppose that a good is offered by a monopolistic manufacturer for $20. Assume, however, that had the production process been perfectly competitive, the same good would have been offered for a price of $12. In this example, the deadweight loss is represented by the foregone transactions of the buyers who value the good at more than $12 but less than $20.

Under perfect competition the consumer would have paid $12 for the good, thus deriving a surplus of $10 ($22 – $12) from the transaction.

It is easy to see that if the monopolist has to determine a fixed, undifferentiated asking price, this price will be either $10,000 (thus authorizing only parodists) or $6,000 (thus authorizing all users, satirists included). The profit-maximizing price in that case is $10,000, since5×$10,000 > 7×$6,000.

In its current conception as a quintessential standard, therefore, the user and the owner confront a given probability that fair use will be recognized. But as noted earlier, this probability—created by the malleable, open-ended environment in which fair use determinations are being made—may render a user’s threat of resorting to unauthorized use credible, which in turn creates a favorable bargaining framework that allows them to secure authorization with reduced licensing fees.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"To see this, compare the current fair use regime with an alternative hypothetical regime in which fair use is governed by rules, namely, all permitted uses are well-defined on an ex ante basis. This alternative design leaves no room for uncertainty as to the defense’s applicability: the probability that fair use will be recognized in a given case iseitherzero or one. While allowing clarity and complete reliance, we wish to stress the adverse effect that such dichotomy carries on parties’ bargaining. Begin with cases wherein fair use will be conferred upon users with complete certainty. It is evident that whenever a fair use ruling is guaranteed, users are unwilling to pay for licensing, and negotiations will never take place. On the other hand, if there is no chance for a user to enjoy a fair use judgment, they are essentially confronting a world without fair use, hence the doctrine fails to bestow licensing leverage upon them.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This comparison of a standard-based versus rule-based fair use illuminates the surprising virtue of the current design of the fair use doctrine. To be sure, each user individually, if asked, would say they prefer to obtain fair use with certainty, but the actual comparison that needs to be considered here is whether, behind a veil of ignorance, the right to use copyrighted content without permission should be allocated with certainty to a distinct,smallclass of users, or with uncertainty to a class of abroaderscope. Users may reasonably subscribe to the latter. As noted earlier, a well-defined fair use doctrine not only allows fewer users to invoke the right in court, but more importantly, it also deprives all the rest from the licensing leverage they would have enjoyed under uncertain fair use, thereby subjecting them to the choice of paying the monopolistic asking price or avoid using.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Indeed, the current design of fair use facilitates a bargaining framework in which users enjoy discounts in asking prices on account of the possibility of a future fair use judgment in their favor. Conversely, a clearly and fully specified fair use doctrine will have no effect on owner-user bargaining: it advances fair use as a mere substitute to negotiations, rather than a complement. If parties foresee a fair use ruling with probability 1, bargaining will not take place; if a fair use judgment is not feasible, then parties essentially reside in a world without fair use, and the doctrine does not therefore impact their negotiated licensing terms. Either way, predicating the fair use doctrine as a system of well-defined bright line rules precludes its function in assisting users.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Interestingly, fair use’s ambiguity not only aids users with a strong fair use claim, but it also broadens the scope of user population that enjoys licensing leverage. To see this, consider the widely accepted distinction between parodies and satires, which prevails sinceCampbell.Traditionally, it has been argued that this distinction favors parodists by exempting them from any authorization requirements, while disadvantaging satirists who enjoy no similar privilege.But this argument, too, overlooks the hidden benefit that users at large—parodists and satirists alike—can reap from fair use. To see this, it is necessary to take a step back and picture a world without fair use protection granted to parodies. In such a world, the author of the original work holds the upper hand by exercising complete control over the licensing process and can exclusively decide which subsequent works to authorize. The vestment of fair use privileges on parodies spills over to hybrid works that combine critical commentary on the original work as well as more general statements that amount to satire.This, in turn, means that satirists, too, reap some benefit from fair use. The effect of fair use on satirists is never zero. Because there is no clear distinction between parodies and satires, the fair use doctrine—on account of this very ambiguity—bestows bargaining leverage not only on parodists, but also on satirists.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Yet, in such case, litigation essentially serves as a means of monopolistic price discrimination. Since this Section studies the effect of fair use on copyright pricing in a market without the rightsholder’s ability to engage in price discrimination, we assume that the asking price is $5,000. Either way, what this example aims to demonstrate is that satirists enjoy an increased licensing leverage on account of fair use, despite having no chance of enjoying this defense in court.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
