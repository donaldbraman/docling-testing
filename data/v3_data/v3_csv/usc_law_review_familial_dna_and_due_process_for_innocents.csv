1,"Ever  since  genealogical  DNA  unmasked  the  Golden  State  Killer  in 2018, the use of this new forensic science has been ubiquitous. Police have solved several hundred cold cases by uploading unidentified crime scene DNA  samples  to  consumer  genealogical  databases  and,  with  expert assistance, building out family trees from the resulting matches to identify suspects.  This  practice  has  raised  significant  concerns  among  privacy scholars  due  to  the  intimate  nature  of  DNA  information  and  the  lack  of consent by the parties ultimately identified through their relatives' choice to upload data. Critics argue that the Fourth Amendment bars law enforcement from running warrantless familial DNA searches using consumer databases, even among users who have given their consent. Several states have also passed legislation banning or severely restricting such searches.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
1,"This Article argues that the current debate around familial DNA has neglected the due process rights of another person: the innocent third party who is potentially convicted in the absence of accurate, exculpatory DNA evidence. Both the Compulsory Process and Due Process Clauses give a defendant the right to obtain exculpatory evidence in their defense through judicial subpoena and from the government itself under Brady doctrine. In close cases, the respective scopes of competing constitutional rights should be defined so as to not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Article argues against any ban on, or categorical constitutional or statutory rule requiring, probable cause for law enforcement to conduct familial DNA searches.

6,"This  Article  is  the  first  to  examine  this  question  with  regard  to  a forgotten constitutional stakeholder: the potentially innocent 'other' suspect who, like Christopher Tapp, familial DNA might exonerate. While critics on both sides tend to balance the privacy rights of targeted parties against the crime-solving interests of the government, the constitutional framework is more complicated than this given the due process rights of these potential defendants. In Part One, this Article explains the science of forensic DNA generally, familial DNA specifically, and their roles in investigations and exonerations. Part Two presents the Fourth Amendment background to this problem  and  summarizes  the  argument  that  courts  should  recognize  a reasonable expectation of privacy that would prohibit warrantless familial DNA searches, even where DTC users give consent. Part Two also asserts that while this argument is colorable, it is weak. This is due to both standing problems and the fact that the privacy interest in not being identified as the specific depositor of a single DNA sample is not comparable to the interest in the privacy of one's daily movements.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Such a right derives from three sources: the Compulsory Process Clause, the due process  right  to  exculpatory  evidence,  and  the  due  process  right  to  postconviction relief procedures. This Part argues both that defendants themselves should not be legally barred from running familial DNA searches in public or private databases and that the practical realization of their due process rights  requires  that  law  enforcement  not  be  so  barred  either.  Part Four concludes that, in close cases, competing constitutional rights must not excessively burden one another. On that basis, this Part argues against any categorical rule substantially preventing law enforcement from conducting familial DNA searches. While legislatures are well-advised to limit the use of this technology to serious cases in which other investigative techniques have failed, they should not adopt bans or probable cause requirements; if they do, they should at least create an explicit process for defense subpoenas.

Specifically, the Court balanced the defendant's privacy interest against 'the need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process  and  identify  the  persons  and  possessions  they  must  take  into custody.' 154 Noting  that  a  search  incident  to  arrest  is  a  long-standing exception to the warrant requirement, the Court, nevertheless, did not invoke the doctrine directly (likely because it limits a search to what is necessary to protect officer safety, prevent escape, and preserve evidence). 155 Instead, the Court found that '[w]hen probable cause exists to remove an individual from the  normal  channels  of  society  and  hold  him  in  legal  custody,  DNA identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.' 156 Finding the intrusion on the defendant's privacy through the physical act of swabbing for DNA to be minimal, the Court upheld the MDCA.

Furthermore,  she  notes  that there is a much stronger property interest in one's own genetic information than  in  one's  location  data-a  fact  seemingly  supported  by  the  user agreements of genetic sites which emphasize the user's 'ownership' of their own data, as well as the statutes in the five states that recognize it. 181",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

As discussed above,  Ram  makes  a  good  argument  that  genetic  data  obtained  through familial  searches  meets  the Carpenter factors  insofar  as  it  is  intimate, comprehensive, and inexpensive, as well as involuntary from the perspective of the family member ultimately identified. 195 Yet there are some compelling counterarguments. As to the intimacy of the data, Jasper Monroe-Jones notes that-unlike  location  or  cell  phone  data-DNA  'cannot  reveal  anything about a person's actual actions, conduct, or character' but only, if anything, predisposition  to  various  traits  or  diseases. 196 This  point  is  even  stronger when  coupled  with  the  fact  that  law  enforcement  officials  who  access consumer DNA sites only access the same identification information as other users, which does not include intimate information such as propensity for physical  or  psychological  diseases. 197 While  it  would  be  theoretically possible for law enforcement to reconstruct such intimate information from the information  they can obtain, states could  pass laws  specifically prohibiting  this  practice,  which  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice's  current Interim Policy on Forensic Genetic Genealogy already does. 198 In short, a DNA  match  in  a  DTC  database  only  provides  one  significant  piece  of information: the fact that a person or their family member was present at the place from which a sample was recovered.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Constitutional Limitations,section_header,footnote,,"This Article focuses its analysis on familial searches of DTC databases in which the original user has affirmatively consented to law enforcement searches. A situation with no such consent would give the initial user a potential Fourth Amendment claim after Carpenter’s weakening of the third-party doctrine, though, as this Section will argue, an indirectly identified family member should lack standing to raise it. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 91 (1998) (holding that third parties lack standing to challenge the constitutional violations of others). A situation without such explicit consent but where a website’s Terms of Service stipulated that information was subject to search by law enforcement raises a separate question. After Carpenter, it is, again, unclear that the third-party doctrine alone would automatically bar such a claim based merely on use of the database, though the Terms of Service would be relevant to the question of whether the user had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information they shared there. Many courts have held that agreeing to a website’s terms of service constitutes a full-blown waiver of Fourth Amendment rights against government searches. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dunkins, 229 A.3d 622, 629–30 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2020), allocatur granted, 237 A.3d 415 (Pa. 2020) (per curiam).

Nonetheless,  Part  Two  concluded  that  the argument that such searches require a warrant after Carpenter is fairly weak. In the first place, the specific privacy interest recognized by Carpenter in the totality  of  one's  movements  implicates  detailed  information  about  one's actual life. By contrast, with the proper limitations on use, a DNA match reveals  only  one  significant  piece  of  information:  that  a  subject  left  a particular  sample  in  a  particular  place.  More  importantly,  no  authority recognizes  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  in  someone  else's  bodily materials. Familial DNA works because a subject has left their own sample at a crime scene, and the police match it to the profile of a physical sample offered voluntarily by a relative. A suspect does not have a right to bar their spouse from allowing the police to take a sperm sample from their own body after marital intimacy in order to compare it to the sample in a rape kit. In the case of consumer databases, the suspect's connection to the consenting party  is  even  more  attenuated  and  less  voluntary.

Even if legislatures or courts only barred law enforcement from conducting such searches, the defendant's access to the  subpoena  power  is  heavily  limited  in  many  jurisdictions  by  the materiality and favorability requirements, and any useful hits resulting from such a search would in any case require expensive forensic testing to lead to a specific subject. Thus, the reality is that a defendant is usually only going to access important exculpatory evidence through Brady, which would put familial  DNA  largely  out  of  reach  if  the  police  were  precluded  from conducting searches at all or only with probable cause. In any given case, this  problem  is  also  compounded  by  limited  options  post-conviction,  at which point the Supreme Court has held that Brady does not apply and no independent right to DNA testing exists. Law enforcement's ability to access the most accurate evidence on the front end affects a defendant's right to obtain the most important kind of exculpatory evidence under Brady .",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

55,"In Osborne ,  the  Supreme  Court  declined  to  'constitutionalize'  postconviction DNA testing as a freestanding due process right to protect the liberty  interest  of  a  potentially  wrongfully  convicted  party. 353 Innocent defendants would then be especially harmed by an asymmetrical attempt to 'constitutionalize'  DNA  on  the  front  end-during  investigations.  Should courts recognize, or legislatures adopt, a Fourth Amendment rule that keeps familial  DNA  away  from  law  enforcement  absent  probable  cause,  such defendants would be effectively shut off from the most accurate and valuable evidence at all stages of the criminal process. Like the Fourth Amendment argument,  this  Sixth  Amendment  argument  is  also  somewhat  weak  since most courts do not even recognize a Brady right to law enforcement searches of public databases. Nonetheless, because a categorical ban on warrantless searches would essentially render all familial DNA evidence inaccessible, it would inherently block a defendant's access to exculpatory evidence.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
55,"The admissibility of familial DNA is, thus, not a due process question in which it makes sense to think of balancing one defendant's rights against purely  'government  interests'  (although  the  accuracy  of  DNA  evidence certainly makes the government's crime-solving interest particularly high).

This practice has raised significant concerns among privacy scholars due to the intimate nature of DNA information and the lack of consent by the parties ultimately identified through their relatives’ choice to upload data.

Katz, however, the Court made a change.InKatz, FBI agents had attached a listening device to the outside of a public telephone booth in which the defendant was making a call.Explicitly overruling prior precedent, the Court held that this constituted a warrantless search and announced a new rule: “[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. . . . But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.”This new test for the existence of a Fourth Amendment search has become known (based on language in Justice Harlan’s concurrence) as the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test.To apply it, courts ask, first, whether the defendant had exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy and, second, whether that expectation was “one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

As to the intimacy of the data, Jasper Monroe-Jones notes that—unlike location or cell phone data—DNA “cannot reveal anything about a person’sactualactions, conduct, or character” but only, if anything, predisposition to various traits or diseases.This point is even stronger when coupled with the fact that law enforcement officials who access consumer DNA sites only access the same identification information as other users, which does not include intimate information such as propensity for physical or psychological diseases.While it would be theoretically possible for law enforcement to reconstruct such intimate information from the information they can obtain, states could pass laws specifically prohibiting this practice, which the U.S. Department of Justice’s current Interim Policy on Forensic Genetic Genealogy already does.In short, a DNA match in a DTC database only provides one significant piece of information: the fact that a person or their family member was present at the place from which a sample was recovered.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"With the specificCarpenterfactors only partially apposite to the problem of familial DNA, it is worth recurring to the testCarpenterattempts to apply: reasonable expectation of privacy. While it seems clear that Grandpa B cannot consent to Person A’s voluntary release of their genetic material to law enforcement, can it be said that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in another person’s body? No authority recognizes such an expectation, which would need to be strong enough to overcome standing principles.It is a weak argument that, even if there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in personal genetic material left in another person’s bathroom, there should be a reasonable expectation of privacy in another person’sowngenetic material that happens partially to match one’s own. As critics of theKatztest’s inherent circularity might note, with the increased public awareness of DNA science, such an expectation of privacy is evenlessreasonable than it might have been in, say, 1985.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Indeed,Greenberg v. Miami Children’s Hospitalarose in Florida—one of only five states with statutes that recognize some form of property interest in genetic test results—and the court nonetheless held that the statute did not create a genetic property interest sufficient for establishing a conversion action.That said, as Jessica Roberts notes, at least a couple of courts have very recently shown receptiveness to conversion claims based on privacy violations involving a plaintiff’sowngenetic material.",,0,html_body_unmatched

As Ram argues, there is a mismatch in consent between the DTC user and the familial relation ultimately identified. Yet that mismatch complements another one: the mismatch in the sensitivity of the information consensually revealed about the initial user (including their immediately accessible name and contact information) and the information about the ultimately identified, distant relation (the match to a specific crime scene sample, established only after extensive analysis). Given the unique accuracy value of what such a search would reveal—near-certain presence at a crime scene—one could argue for a wholesale DNA carveout to the Fourth Amendment. In such cases, one might say that the crime-solving interests of law enforcement are particularly high relative to the interests of the suspect (privacy in the specific fact of having been at a crime scene).

In 1967, the Supreme Court considered this question for the first time inWashington v. Texas, when it considered the constitutionality of two Texas statutes preventing a criminal defendant from offering the testimony of a person charged or convicted as a co-conspirator for the charged crime.The Court first held that the compulsory process right is so fundamental to a fair trial that it is incorporated against the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.It then concluded that it includes the right to “present a defense” to the jury:",,0,html_body_unmatched

Mississippi, the Court decided for the defendant, holding that the combination of Mississippi’s hearsay rule excluding statements against penal interest and its so-called “ ‘voucher’ rule,” preventing a party from impeaching its own witness, violated Due Process.In doing so, however, the Court did not ask the general question it asked inWashingtonand its progeny—whether the Mississippi rule was “arbitrary” or “disproportionate” to its stated goal of preventing perjured or unreliable testimony.

Illinois, the Court—while reemphasizing that the Sixth Amendment provides a defendant not only the right to subpoena witnesses but also the right to put them on the stand—rejected the defendant’s argument that such a right to exculpatory evidence is absolute.It held that the accused “does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence” and noted that “the trial process would be a shambles if either party had an absolute right to control the time and content of his witnesses’ testimony.”On that basis, the Court held that the trial court did not violate the Compulsory Process Clause by excluding a defense witness when it found that the defendant had willfully failed to disclose the witness in an attempt to obtain a tactical advantage that would minimize the effectiveness of cross examination.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In most cases, this could not be known reliably ahead of time because the third-party sample could come from someone easily explained away as innocently present at the crime scene. Furthermore, it could not even be known ahead of time whether a consumer database would provide a familial match at all. Finally, even if a database did contain a familial match, the defense would need an expensive genetic expert to build out a profile of the actual perpetrator from the data of whichever family member had made their identity public.

In jurisdictions following the “strict admissibility rule,” the defendant would likely be unable to meet the admissibility requirement because it would be impossible to prove ahead of time that such a database would in fact contain matches relevant to the case.

First, it noted that DNA testing established that the semen on the victim’s nightgown and panties came from her husband and not House.It noted that this would remove sexual assault as a potential motive for the crime and cast doubt on the jury’s finding of rape as an aggravating factor for sentencing.Second, it considered the testimony of an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Tennessee that indicated that the blood found on House’s pants was chemically too degraded and too similar to blood collected during the autopsy to have come from the victim’s body on the night of the crime.He concluded that the stains were more likely to have been spilled from vials containing autopsy samples.On the basis of all of this evidence, the Court concluded that “although the issue is close [due to other, non-forensic evidence] . . . this is the rare case where—had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony—it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt.”The Court then remanded for consideration of the merits of House’s ineffective assistance claims.While the prosecutor initially vowed to retry House if he successfully overturned his conviction, the prosecutor later dropped the charges after subsequent developments in DNA technology revealed an unknown perpetrator.House had spent over twenty-two years on death row.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Nonetheless, Part Two concluded that the argument that such searches require a warrant afterCarpenteris fairly weak. In the first place, the specific privacy interest recognized byCarpenterin the totality of one’s movements implicates detailed information about one’s actual life. By contrast, with the proper limitations on use, a DNA match reveals only one significant piece of information: that a subject left a particular sample in a particular place. More importantly, no authority recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy in someone else’s bodily materials. Familial DNA works because a subject has left their own sample at a crime scene, and the police match it to the profile of a physical sample offered voluntarily by a relative. A suspect does not have a right to bar their spouse from allowing the police to take a sperm sample from their own body after marital intimacy in order to compare it to the sample in a rape kit. In the case of consumer databases, the suspect’s connection to the consenting party is even more attenuated and less voluntary.

First, any statute preventing criminal defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to subpoena that information would raise compulsory process issues. Even if legislatures or courts only barred law enforcement from conducting such searches, the defendant’s access to the subpoena power is heavily limited in many jurisdictions by the materiality and favorability requirements, and any useful hits resulting from such a search would in any case require expensive forensic testing to lead to a specific subject. Thus, the reality is that a defendant is usually only going to access important exculpatory evidence throughBrady,which would put familial DNA largely out of reach if the police were precluded from conducting searches at all or only with probable cause. In any given case, this problem is also compounded by limited options post-conviction, at which point the Supreme Court has held thatBradydoes not apply and no independent right to DNA testing exists.

Should courts recognize, or legislatures adopt, a Fourth Amendment rule that keeps familial DNA away from law enforcement absent probable cause, such defendants would be effectively shut off from the most accurate and valuable evidence at all stages of the criminal process. Like the Fourth Amendment argument, this Sixth Amendment argument is also somewhat weak since most courts do not even recognize aBradyright to law enforcement searches of public databases.

Stuart, the Court rejected an absolute balancing test between the First and Sixth Amendments where, in order to protect the accused’s right to an impartial jury, a trial judge had issued an order restraining members of the press from publishing or broadcasting accounts of the defendant’s admissions.The Court noted that “[t]he authors of the Bill of Rights did not undertake to assign priorities as between First Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, ranking one as superior to the other”and proceeded to balance the nature and extent of pretrial news coverage, potential mitigating measures, and the effectiveness of a restraining order at preventing the danger; ultimately, the Court held for the petitioner journalists.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"InThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction, Herbert Packer famously divides criminal justice thinking into two camps.One, which he refers to as the “Due Process Model,” values the observation of fair procedures, even at the expense of letting the guilty go free, while the other, the “Crime Control Model,” values accurate determinations of guilt and innocence.Accuracy has, in and of itself, been a value central to constitutionalized criminal due process since the start of the criminal procedure revolution in the mid-twentieth century.Rules about impartiality and reliability, the right to counsel for indigent defendants, the right to cross-examination, and the rule against involuntary confessions all exist to prevent the conviction of innocents due to malicious, lazy, hasty, or overzealous police and prosecutors.InIn re Winship, the Supreme Court held that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a due process requirement in criminal trials on accuracy grounds.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As David Resnick argues, due process serves an important justificatory purpose, providing reasons for subjecting a person to criminal punishment.He notes that “our concern with the subjective probability of correct outcomes reflects a requirement of morality and not simply efficiency or rationality.”Thus, while critics tend to pit accuracy values against due process values in cases where fair process requires guilty defendants to go free, the protection of innocents is a critical moral component of due process. The availability of DNA evidence inherently implicates accuracy values—not only the broader societal goal of identifying the guilty but also an individual’s right not to be punished without justification.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"That said, Packer’s “Due Process Model” fits the argument that unwarranted familial DNA searches violate the Fourth Amendment rights of the third-party family members identified. Under this view of due process, the absence of “fair play” for the suspect should override the state’s interest in crime solving.Some of the Supreme Court decisions that fit this model have been described as premised on “fundamental fairness”—most notablyRochin v. California, which excluded evidence found after law enforcement pumped a suspect’s stomach against his will and without judicial authorization.In an opinion by Justice Frankfurter, the Court held that the stomach pumping—while producing accurate evidence—violated due process because it “shock[ed] the conscience.”The Fourth and Fifth Amendment exclusionary rules in general represent the primacy of fair play over accuracy since they necessarily better protect the procedural rights of the guilty than they do the innocent. However, an unjustly accused party could also argue that principles of fair play and fundamental fairness should prevent them from being criminally convicted without access to a whole body of highly reliable evidence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"It should be noted that there is a third set of due process values beyond these two that is related to the expressive function of criminal procedure and its relationship to public confidence in the justice system. The public will be more likely to support and participate in criminal justice when it believes that the process operates fairly.On that basis, some critics point out that “[a] focus on the individual rights of the defendant to the exclusion of the interests of other participants belies the public’s critical role.”In this view, a trial is not just a fact-finding mission but serves an “important symbolic function as public expressions of the affected parties’ rights to demand that official acts be explained and justified.”This concept of due process is particularly important in the case of familial DNA. High-profile cases like the Golden State Killer have increased public awareness of this science, and exonerations like Christopher Tapp’s, which was widely covered in true crime media, have created demand for it as a means of recourse for the wrongfully accused and convicted.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Ultimately, the case of familial DNA does not present a simple, bilateral competition between fair Fourth Amendment process for a criminal defendant and public interest in crime-detection; it also implicates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of an innocent suspect whose risk of wrongful conviction would be higher in a world with law enforcement access to familial DNA substantially restricted. Should courts consider Fourth Amendment claims challenging familial DNA evidence, they should bear in mind these other defendants when determining whether such searches are reasonable without a warrant. Furthermore, should states seek to regulate law enforcement use of DNA via statute, they should not adopt restrictions as broad as Montana’s. Ideally, even if states do restrict law enforcement access, they should at least create a formal subpoena process to clarify how criminal defendants can access this evidence. However, given the limitations on defense testing resources, this mechanism would likely benefit only a minority of defendants and should be supplemented by some degree of law enforcement access.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Perry, 80 F.3d 915, 926 (4th Cir. 1996).
