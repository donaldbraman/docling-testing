1,FINTECH AND TECHNO-SOLUTIONISM,section_header,body_text,"This dynamic is particularly evident in the context of the crypto industry. Often described by its critics as “a solution in search of a problem,”crypto represents in many ways the apotheosis of fintech and techno-solutionism. Promises have been made that crypto’s underlying blockchain technology can democratize financial services by making them cheaper, more efficient, and more secure—but none of these promises withstand scrutiny. Ultimately, a blockchain is simply a type of database to which entries can only be added, not removed, and which is controlled by multiple nodes instead of relying on centralized intermediaries.While this technology might be interesting from an academic perspective, according to more than 1,500 independent computer scientists, software engineers, and other technologists who signed a letter to U.S. Congressional leaders in 2022, “[b]y its very design, blockchain technology is poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or potential source of public benefit.”",,100.0,matched

It is facilitated entirely by algorithms designed to trade at speeds and in volumes that humans would not be capable of.Proponents of high frequency trading argue that it improves the efficiency of capital intermediation because it increases the volume of trading and by providing more opportunities to transact, increases liquidity and lowers trading costs.But that is only true in normal times. When things are obviously wrong in the market (at least, obvious to a human), the algorithm may continue to trade in a way that generates “flash crashes” of asset prices, which could spark fire sale externalities that threaten the stability of the financial system.If the algorithmdoesrecognize that something is really wrong, more often than not its preprogrammed instruction is to simply stop trading, draining liquidity from the system when it is most needed.",,76.47058823529412,matched

While the mythology of Silicon Valley tells of innovation born of self-made visionaries, governmental bodies have in fact created significant subsidies for the VC industry, which (together with the liability shields and intellectual property protections already discussed) have allowed Silicon Valley and its techno-solutionism to flourish.As Peter Lee points out, “[t]he federal government played a critical role in catalyzing the VC industry by funding technologies that attracted private investment.”State legislatures also created the type of business entity known as the limited partnership, allowing limited liability protection for investors while still preserving favorable capital gains taxation associated with traditionalunlimited liability partnerships—the VC industry has embraced this type of business entity, and its industry associations have aggressively lobbied over the years to lower capital gains taxation rates.The VC industry has also benefitted from other types of favorable tax treatment, outright subsidies, and pension fund regulation that permits such funds to invest in VC(institutional investment was a particular boon to the VC industry during the prolonged period of low interest rates that ran from the Global Financial Crisis until 2022—interest rate setting can also function as a type of VC subsidy).",,80.95238095238095,matched

Regulatory entrepreneurship capitalizes on the pacing problem, seeking to grow 'too big to ban' before the law catches up. But it is not inevitable that the law will fall  hopelessly  behind  technological  development.  Ultimately,  refusing  to apply  the  law  to  a  technology  until  after  it  is  fully  developed  and entrenched-and  then  crafting  accommodative  laws  that  treat  the  extant incarnation of technology-based business models as inevitable-is a choice.

22,II.  FINTECH AND TECHNO-SOLUTIONISM,section_header,body_text,"This dynamic is particularly evident in the context of the crypto industry. Often described by its critics as “a solution in search of a problem,”crypto represents in many ways the apotheosis of fintech and techno-solutionism. Promises have been made that crypto’s underlying blockchain technology can democratize financial services by making them cheaper, more efficient, and more secure—but none of these promises withstand scrutiny. Ultimately, a blockchain is simply a type of database to which entries can only be added, not removed, and which is controlled by multiple nodes instead of relying on centralized intermediaries.While this technology might be interesting from an academic perspective, according to more than 1,500 independent computer scientists, software engineers, and other technologists who signed a letter to U.S. Congressional leaders in 2022, “[b]y its very design, blockchain technology is poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or potential source of public benefit.”",,91.42857142857143,matched
22,"The previous Part spoke about techno-solutionism generally; the rest of this Article will focus more specifically on techno-solutionism as it relates to  fintech.  Because 'finance is at the heart of the economy; is social and political; and is composed of non-stationary relationships that exhibit secular change,' 111 it should be obvious (but sadly often is not) that solutions that neglect  the  social  and  political  dimensions  of  financial  problems  will  be inadequate.  When  technology is presented  as  the  whole  solution  to  a financial problem, then the best-case scenario will be that it fails to live up to its promises. Worst-case scenarios will arise if the shiny promises of the technology distract us from interrogating the downsides of business models that use that technology or distract us from addressing the root causes of the problem that is purportedly being solved.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
22,"In order to critique fintech's techno-solutionism, we need a framework for thinking about what might need 'solving' in finance in the first place. In many ways, the list of potential improvements to financial services and the financial  system  is  infinite,  but  it  is  conceptually  helpful  to  start  by identifying  what  finance  is  supposed  to  do-at  a  high  level-in  order  to consider  how  it  could  do  it  better.  In  the  book Principles  of  Financial Regulation , John Armour and his colleagues identify the following as the key  socially beneficial functions of the financial system:  facilitating payments;  mobilizing  capital;  selecting  projects  and  monitoring  their performance; and managing risk. 112 These can be collapsed further into three broad categories of functions: transaction processing, capital intermediation, and  risk  management. 113 If  the  financial  system  is  not  performing  these functions inclusively, efficiently, competitively, or securely, there may be a problem that needs to be fixed.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

If fintech providers could provide  an  end  run  around  these  political  problems  by providing quick and affordable payments processing, then that would be very appealing.  Unfortunately,  though,  fintech  payments  providers  sometimes overclaim  regarding  the  increased  efficiencies  of  their  technologies.  For example, despite repeated crypto industry assertions of improved efficiency, 207 the underlying blockchain technology is inefficient by design. 208 Processing  transactions  on  any  decentralized  permissionless ledger  will  always  be  slower  and  more  cumbersome  than  available centralized alternatives, because in the absence of costly computations, it would be too easy for a bad actor to take over a technologically decentralized system. 209 As  a  result,  transaction  processing  on  blockchains  is  slow  and expensive (and the cost and timing of such processing is often unpredictable), and blockchains struggle to scale to process large volumes of transactions. 210",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

One problem with techno-solutionism is that it downplays the value of non-technological domain area expertise, 289 but the history and context for why we regulate finance are critical parts of any discussion of how the law should address fintech.

If financial regulators are convinced or forced to get out of the way so that technological innovation can go ahead and fix things, then that will create a conducive environment for the fintech industry and its funders to arbitrage regulatory requirements and perhaps even harden that arbitrage into durable legal permissions (a strategy known as “regulatory entrepreneurship”).To illustrate these dynamics, this Article will examine examples of legislative proposals and administrative actions that highlight where techno-solutionism seems to be driving policy around fintech, as well as examples of pushback against techno-solutionism.

If AI does indeed end up eliminating lots of jobs, we will need policy solutions that take into account the dignity of work as well as people's need for income. 434 Worldcoin, however, offers (at best) an oversimplified solution to such a complex problem-a potential method for paying people to watch their screens once they no longer have jobs. And Worldcoin  downplays  the  privacy  concerns  associated  with  training  its models on the biometric data of vulnerable people and the predatory aspects of paying those people for their biometric data with a potentially worthless crypto asset. 435",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Techno-solutionism is often evident in conversations about the financial applications of technologies like artificial intelligence (“AI”), blockchain, cloud computing, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”), which have been promoted as having the power to make the delivery of financial services more inclusive, more efficient, more competitive, and more secure. While there may be promise in some fintech business models, this Article explains why fintech’s ability to solve long-standing, complex problems is often oversold. This Article also explores how techno-solutionist fintech hype can distract from more meaningful solutions to long-standing problems and obscure fintech’s harms.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Recognizing that techno-solutionism is a heuristic that probably will not be eliminated without an alternative, this Article argues that financial regulators and lawmakers should instead adopt a posture of contextually informed skepticism that draws on domain knowledge about what can go wrong in finance and is sensitive to the harms that fintech may cause. Of course, there are many structural impediments to such a shift in perspective and it will not be easily accomplished. Right now, the best that we can do may be to simply call out the phenomenon of techno-solutionism where we see it and, in doing so, rob it of some of its power.",,0,html_body_unmatched

More subtly, technologies that overpromise but are incomplete solutions to complex structural problems can also be distractions, alleviating political pressure for solutions to the non-technological dimensions of problems.As tech ethicist Elizabeth Renieris has put it, “Our imaginations and resources are once again diverted from fixing or rehabilitating what exists”: when the technological solution is pitched as so exceptional, the slow plodding changes of structural reform seem less worthy by comparison.This dynamic is sometimes evident, for example, in policy debates about climate change, where the promise of new technologies has sometimes undercut support for policies to reduce emissions.",,0,html_body_unmatched

When technologies are developed by for-profit businesses, those businesses have strong incentives to develop those technologies in the way that will most benefit them financially (even if doing so could inflict harm on society).Financial incentives will also impact how startup founders and their tech employees describe their technologies to others, including the venture capital (“VC”) firms they approach for funding.VCs display significant herd behavior in choosing which “hot” technologies to fund,with the result that founders trying to attract capital are likely to start by asking “how can we use [currently favored technology] to solve X?,” rather than “how can we best solve X?”",,0,html_body_unmatched

Any business is built in an environment constructed by laws, and the laws themselves have been impacted by currents of economic and political power.Laws and legal institutions engage with technology-based business models from the beginning,and those laws and legal institutions have been “enlisted to help produce the profound economic and sociotechnical transformations that we see all around us.”If citizens concerned about public harms cede the legal sphere to businesses with vested interests in structures that insulate them from the consequences of perpetrating harms, then the ability of the law to protect the public from harm will be further eroded.This is a pervasive political economy problem, but it will be exacerbated by techno-solutionism if public-minded citizens cede their ground because those who stand to profitalsohave intimidating technological bona fides.",,0,html_body_unmatched

It clarifies, and draws attention to, the behavior it prohibits. Law’s expressed meaning serves mutually reinforcing purposes. Law educates the public about what is socially harmful.”While the expressive function of the law is most often discussed in terms of what it prohibits, permissive laws may also change public attitudes about what shouldnotbe considered socially harmful—and change behavior accordingly.The literature on expressive laws focuses on the law’s ability to standardize norms,and the law can perform a particularly potent standardizing function at a time when a technologically-enabled practice is new and the public is looking for guidance as to what to think about that practice.As a result, laws and rules that emphasize the benefits of a technology and related business models and deprioritize their harms can have a normative consequence in addition to their direct impact, lending legitimacy and encouraging adoption.

If the attendant harms of technological innovation are seemingly minor, then an accommodative or faciliatory approach may make sense; such an approach is less justifiable when the associated harms are significant. But by insulating technology’s harms from legal scrutiny, such legal structures shift public attention away from the harms, entrenching techno-solutionist perspectives that focus only on technology’s positives.",,0,html_body_unmatched

If public authorities remain mindful of potential harms and deploy incentives and subsidies as part of a portfolio strategy that also considers where direct public investment might be more effective, such an approach is likely to broadly benefit society. Unfortunately, the political landscape in the United States has evolved in such a way that the deck is often stacked against pursuing public sector solutions: Mazzucato attributes this in part to “the emergence of ‘new public management’ theory, which grew out of ‘public choice’ theory in the 1980s,” and “led civil servants to believe that they should take up as little space as possible, fearing that government failures may be even worse than market failures.”How to encourage public innovation is an important topic, but it is beyond the scope of this Article. Whatisrelevant to this Article is that the flip side of timidity with regard to public innovation can manifest as credulousness with respect to private sector technological solutions and undeserved acceptance of their harms. While such credulousness is often unwarranted—particularly when the problem that needs solving would never truly be attempted by the private sector because solving it will take too long and primarily generate public goods that venture capitalists cannot profit from—the law has helped build this credulousness with its subsidies and waivers for private sector technological innovation.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Regulatory entrepreneurship capitalizes on the pacing problem, seeking to grow “too big to ban” before the law catches up. But it is not inevitable that the law will fall hopelessly behind technological development. Ultimately, refusing to apply the law to a technology until after it is fully developed and entrenched—and then crafting accommodative laws that treat the extant incarnation of technology-based business models as inevitable—is a choice. That choice, which can stymie the harm-reduction functions of law, is often encouraged by cognitive capture, donations, and lobbying, all of which are part of the regulatory entrepreneurship playbook.",,0,html_body_unmatched

When technologyispresented as the whole solution to a financial problem, then the best-case scenario will be that it fails to live up to its promises. Worst-case scenarios will arise if the shiny promises of the technology distract us from interrogating the downsides of business models that use that technology or distract us from addressing the root causes of the problem that is purportedly being solved.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In many ways, the list of potential improvements to financial services and the financial system is infinite, but it is conceptually helpful to start by identifying what finance is supposed to do—at a high level—in order to consider how it could do it better. In the bookPrinciples of Financial Regulation, John Armour and his colleagues identify the following as the key socially beneficial functions of the financial system: facilitating payments; mobilizing capital; selecting projects and monitoring their performance; and managing risk.These can be collapsed further into three broad categories of functions: transaction processing, capital intermediation, and risk management.If the financial system is not performing these functions inclusively, efficiently, competitively, or securely, there may be a problem that needs to be fixed.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"As noted above, the financial system provides critical payments and other transaction processing services. Everyday people benefit from these services, and they also benefit from the mobilization of capital: both as savers and investors who profit from returns, and as recipients of credit. Building wealth and diversifying investments can also help people manage the financial risks they may face in their lives. People who are excluded from traditional financial services can be charged significant premiums for transacting, locked out of full participation in the economy, and denied opportunities to manage their financial risks and build wealth.Improving access (which is often referred to as “financial inclusion”) is therefore viewed as a critically important social goal.However, improving financial inclusion requires an understanding of the reasons why people are currently excluded, and the consequences of that exclusion. These are textured and context-specific, and once we start looking at the relevant context, it soon becomes clear that technology alone cannot solve financial inclusion problems. Unfortunately, though, fintech’s hype can undermine support for the kinds of public-driven solutions (including “hard service mandates, public provision, or taxpayer subsidies”) that could actually improve financial inclusion.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"Christopher K. Odinet, for example, argues that while some fintech credit providers claim that their online interfaces and machine learning-based credit scoring procedures differentiate them from predatory payday lending models, they often charge rates of interest that are similar to those charged by payday lenders.In a similar vein, Nakita Cuttino has examined the earned-wage access fintech business model,which has been described by one proponent as a “revolutionary employee benefit program that offers employees almost instant access to their pay.”She finds that while this business model does offer some improvements over the prevailing payday lending model, it still has “varying effects that sometimes perpetuate, and in some instances exacerbate, the very risks providers claim to eliminate when displacing short-term creditors like payday lenders.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

Fintech lending models have, however, been constructed to avoid certain consumer protections like usury limits and state licensing requirements by engaging in “rent-a-bank” partnerships with banks;earned-wage access programs also currently escape most meaningful consumer protection regulation.Odinet notes that the mystique of technology has been strategically weaponized to avoid regulation, observing that “the politics of tech . . . is giving political cover to predatory fintech lenders and clouding what should otherwise be a clear headed and aggressive approach by financial regulators in stamping out these harmful practices.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

There is some indication that this is, in fact, the case.

Banks, for example, could be required to use readily available technologies to clear and settle payments more speedily by amending the Expedited Funds Availability Act.The Federal Reserve launched its real-time payments service, FedNow, on July 20, 2023, but uptake by banks has been slow.Congress could consider mandating that banks join FedNow to ensure that these faster payment rails are available to their customers.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Most obviously, using insecure APIs to transmit data creates opportunities for data breaches, fraud, and identity theft (fintech lending business models that assemble extensive non-traditional data profiles to address the creditworthiness of their users will also be attractive targets for such practices).But the sharing of data contemplated by open banking will also generate more subtle threats to our informational security, in the form of increased surveillance by an increased number of parties who can then use that data to manipulate us and others like us.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Raul Carillo has noted that fintech firms, like other technology companies, “reconstitute people into ‘data doubles,’ which can then be sorted, stored, scored, shared, and sold.”The increased sophistication of machine learning technology is only making this kind of data more valuable.Data about consumers’ payments are particularly valuable, because those data yield rich, detailed, and unvarnished insights into how individuals behave and what they value.Individuals will often fail to understand how their payments data might be used or what it communicates about them,but this kind of data can be used to surveil and then manipulate them.For example, Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) Director Rohit Chopra raised concerns that “Big Tech firms can use detailed payments data to develop personalized pricing algorithms for e-commerce or increase engagement with behavioral advertising.”Alicia Solow-Niederman has emphasized that machine learning technology can now be deployed to “use available data collected from individuals to generate further information about both those individuals and about other people,” and these inferences can then be used to predict people’s behavior, manipulate them, and color reputations.Payments platforms may even use the data they collect about their users to deplatform them, censoring people’s ability to engage in financial transactions.These kinds of harms are not distributed equally, and often the most vulnerable groups will be surveilled the most as well as suffer the most from this surveillance: “[M]any lower-income users rely exclusively on mobile platforms that are less versatile, less amenable to user customization and control, and designed to maximize data sensing and harvesting.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"If we truly wish to minimize the production of payments data, the most simple solution does not require any technology—lawmakers could take steps to preserve physical cash infrastructure, as cash transactions do not generate any data (there are also financial inclusion and resilience justifications for ensuring that cash continues to be accepted).As a supplement to physical cash, Carillo proposes a “Postal Cash Card” that can store value and facilitate transactions in a way that emulates debit cards but does not generate any data about the holder.Carillo’s proposal is an illustration of the principle that rejecting techno-solutionism does not necessarily mean rejecting technology: he has proposed a technological innovation (the card), but also provided a detailed proposal about the institutional context in which it will be offered (non-profit, at the post office), in a way that is responsive to expressed privacy concerns and pushes back against the tide of “data-vacuuming” in for-profit technological development. Carillo’s proposal also supplies another illustration of the point that when it comes to technological innovation, incentives matter, and so a technology developed by a public entity for a non-profit purpose is more likely to avoid the siren song of mass data collection than a private sector payments technology.",,0,html_body_unmatched

As part of that discussion, Part II identified a panoply of fintech harms in need of regulation, but the law’s ability to rein in such harms is often stymied by techno-solutionismthat it helps perpetuate.

,,,,"This Article has already observed that technology businesses are constructed in part by law; as Katharina Pistor has explained, the same is true for finance.Financial regulation is a constitutive part of fintech’s evolution, but the law as applied to fintech has sometimes had an unhealthy relationship with techno-solutionism. One problem with techno-solutionism is that it downplays the value of non-technological domain area expertise,but the history and context for why we regulate finance are critical parts of any discussion of how the law should address fintech. This Section therefore provides some background on financial regulation more generally, before the next Section demonstrates how financial regulation can both facilitate and be inhibited by techno-solutionism.",,0,html_body_unmatched

We often hear fintech services analogized to other internet services—“send money around the world as easily as you can send an email”—but losing money is much more consequential than losing an email (certainly for the person involved, and potentially also for confidence in financial institutions and the broader financial system). Because the stakes are so high, and because we have so many historical examples of things going badly wrong in the financial system, finance has long been heavily regulated—in a way that couriered letters never were. Techno-solutionists ignore that history at their (or rather, our) peril.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"While it is possible to interpret efficiency and competition mandates as complementary to the goals of investor and consumer protection and financial stability,efficiency and competition mandates are often framed in ways that conflict with those other goals (for example, as Part II explored, fintech that has been touted as promoting efficiency and competition can come at the price of exposing consumers and investors to predatory inclusion). If it is assumed that technology is the best, easiest, or only way to improve efficiency and competition, this techno-solutionist framing will lend itself to accommodative regulatory strategies that sacrifice investor, consumer, and financial stability protection goals. This is not just an issue for regulators: lawmakers in Congress have also sometimes been swayed by techno-solutionism. The next Section will consider whether fintech-specific legislative and regulatory proposals have helped perpetuate techno-solutionism in a way that undermines financial regulation’s ability to protect the public from harm.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Fintech poses many challenges for the enterprise of financial regulation: as Saule Omarova has observed, fintech disrupts financial regulation’s “basic normative thrust, its hierarchy of goals, its procedural mechanisms and tools, and its practical efficacy.”Furthermore, there are some truly novel privacy-type harms arising from the movement toward an economy “oriented principally toward the production, accumulation, and processing of information,” and existing financial regulation is not up to protecting against these kinds of harms.For example, existing financial privacy statutes (like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) are simply not up to the task of responding to the types of privacy concerns explored in Section II.D,and existing financial regulation would similarly struggle to address the harms that would arise from the integration of large tech platforms and finance.With all that said, though, existing financial regulation can still force a reckoning with many of the negative consequences of fintech innovation and require them to be remedied. We have decades of experience with many of the kinds of harms that fintech is inflicting, and many of the problems raised in Part II have solutions based in existing legal remedies. The fact that new technologies have come to play an increasingly important role in delivering financial services has sometimes been weaponized (through cognitive capture and related strategies) to obscure the applicability of existing law, but we should not unquestioningly accept the premise that all previous grants of regulatory authority (and the rules implementing them) are hopelessly outmoded and obsolete as a result of technological change.",,0,html_body_unmatched

For example, Congressman Jesus García introduced a “Close the ILC Loophole Act,”designed to prevent technology platform companies from exploiting a loophole in the Bank Holding Company Act that could allow those companies to acquire banks without being regulated by the Federal Reserve (which would essentially allow them to avoid financial stability regulation).Congressman Lynch also introduced an “ECASH Act”that proposed to direct the Treasury Department to develop and issue “an electronic version of the U.S. Dollar for use by the American public.”This bill is an example of technology-focused public policy that is not techno-solutionist: it is focused on developing technology to solve financial inclusion concerns, but is sensitive to non-technological context. In particular, in response to the kinds of consumer protection and privacy concerns raised in Section II.D, the proposal for ECASH is intended to “preserve a role in our financial system for smaller anonymous cash-like transactions which are currently transacted in physical dollars, and which have seen a rapid decline in use.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu identified a dichotomy between regulators “taming” and “accommodating” financial innovation. Taming forces the technology to “conform to regulatory standards,” whereas an accommodative stance that dictates that “regulation should adjust to . . . and accept the new technology and possibilities for what they are” is much more techno-solutionist.Accommodative regulators may take steps to actively loosen regulatory requirements, but often, accommodation takes the form ofinactionwith regulators simply refraining from exercising their jurisdiction when new technologies are involved. Either way, an overly accommodative stance will subordinate regulatory goals to the claimed promise of the technology, neglecting the reality that sometimes the negative consequences of a technology are such that accommodating that technology is bad policy (particularly if the technology itself is considered by independent experts to have limited utility).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Unfortunately, reality does not always meet these ideals. This is no doubt due, in part, to cognitive capture. The financial industry has long weaponized complexity to deflect regulatory scrutiny,but with the rise of fintech, that financial complexity is being overlaid with technological complexity. Many financial regulatory agencies are primarily staffed with lawyers, economists, and accountants who may need to rely on the fintech industry to help them understand how a particular technology works,and this can be a fertile environment for cognitive capture to develop. Of course, individual agency personnel are just that—individuals. It is often remarked that “personnel is policy,”and those with some technological expertise may feel more empowered to push back against techno-solutionism.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The following discussion of fintech-related administrative actions sometimes demonstrates whipsaws in an agency’s fintech policy that can be partially explained by changes in the political orientation of agency leadership. This dynamic has been most obvious with the CFPB; at the other end of the spectrum, the SEC has been quite consistent in its fintech policy across administrations.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Notably accommodative administrative actions include the OCC’s 2018 announcement of a nonbank fintech charter and the CFPB’s 2019 proposal for a fintech regulatory sandbox. Both of these had a techno-solutionist orientation, although neither were ultimately successful in their accommodations. The OCC’s proposed fintech charter was a response to concerns that nonbank fintech firms had to comply with consumer protection regulations in every state where they did business.A national special purpose charter from the OCC would have preempted many of these state consumer protection regulations—and the OCC justified the proposal on the assumption that it would facilitate technological innovation that would further financial inclusion.Ultimately, however, this proposal was mired in legal challenges and industry largely eschewed the fintech charter.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In June 2018, then-SEC Corporate Finance Director Bill Hinman delivered what has come to be known as the “Hinman speech” in which he expressed his excitement about blockchain’s potential for decentralization, and he suggested that tokens might not be considered securities “[i]f the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized.”This speech uncritically accepted the crypto industry’s decentralization rhetoric, neglecting the fact that blockchain’s technological decentralization does nothing to prevent the economic centralization that the SEC is concerned with.Overall, however, the SEC has generally looked beyond that rhetoric and concluded that crypto tokens are subject to the securities laws—as SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated in 2022:",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"More recently, guidance from banking regulators has paid less heed to unsubstantiated promises of crypto’s technological innovation. Most notably, in January 2023, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC jointly issued strong guidance indicating their expectations that banks would remain separated from crypto, in order to ensure the continuing stability of the banking system.In that statement, the agencies articulated the following non-techno-solutionist position:",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Once regulatory bodies have promulgated rules or informal guidance, they must then engage in supervision, examination, or other monitoring to ensure compliance. It can be difficult to interrogate how these processes are being discharged, as they are often confidential, performed away from the public eye.Sometimes information about these processes is made public, however, and Art Wilmarth has used publicly available sources to document many of the entanglements between banking and crypto that banking supervisors have permitted.Although it seems unlikely that these entanglements could presently threaten the stability of the overall financial system—particularly because regulators have not authorized any U.S. bank to invest directly in crypto assets or accept them as collateral—such entanglementsdidhelp bring down Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, which relied heavily on the crypto industry for deposits and fee income.The failure of these banks exacerbated a broader regional banking crisis in 2023, and in its report on that crisis, the FDIC conceded that “in retrospect, the FDIC could have acted sooner and more forcefully to compel the bank’s management and its board to address these [AML and risk management] deficiencies more quickly and more thoroughly.”Nothing was said in the report, though, about whether regulators had accommodative attitudes toward crypto business models and technologies that helped induce their inaction.",,0,html_body_unmatched

James Kwak observed that in the lead-up to the 2008 crisis, “[t]he financial sector . . . seems to have gained the cooperation of the federal regulatory agencies . . .

Awrey and Zwieten have explained that some Venmo customers store funds in Venmo accounts and assume that those funds will remain available for transactions, notwithstanding that Venmo may have used the funds elsewhere or that the funds may be commingled in a Venmo bankruptcy.Venmo customers may not appreciate these vulnerabilities now, but if concerns develop about Venmo and the way it holds customer funds, customers may pull their funds out in something that closely resembles a bank run.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"To be clear, enforcement may be made more challenging by increasing technological sophistication. For example, when it comes to the CFPB seeking to address discrimination in the provision of credit, enforcement is “increasingly difficult when decisions . . . are made via criteria deeply embedded in complex algorithms used to detect patterns in masses of data.”As the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has noted, “[m]any AI approaches present ‘explainability’ challenges that make it difficult to assess the suitability and reliability of AI models and to assess the accuracy and potential bias of AI output.”But the harm identified here (discrimination in the provision of credit) is familiar, and the CFPB’s necessary legal authority (pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act) holds up, despite the technological innovation. The CFPB confirmed that it will enforce the law “regardless of the technology being used” and that arguing that “the technology used to make a credit decision is too complex, opaque, or new is not a defense for violating these laws.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

The technologies we call “artificial intelligence” do not currently display characteristics of real human intelligence, though—they lack the ability to reflect on or engage with their existence in a world where others exist too.Some have suggested that the term “applied statistics” is therefore a more accurate description of these technologies, but the “AI” label has stuck.This label can serve to distract people from the important role that human computer scientists play in programming the software that will “learn” from the data presented to it, and the role that data scientists can play in selecting and curating that data.The term “learn” is in quotation marks because AI does not learn in the same way a human does. AI does not seek to establish causality or engage in formal reasoning but instead looks for correlations (even weak correlations) in data and uses these to formulate decision-making rules that will guide it in performing an assigned task(hence the moniker “applied statistics”).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"There is a particular interest in the efficiency gains that generative AI can make—but those claims to efficiency are quite techno-solutionist. The large language models (“LLMs”) used for generative AI are extremely expensive to create, and after those sunk costs have been incurred, they will continue to be extremely expensive to maintain and run—at the most basic level, they require significant amounts of electricity and water(as with blockchains, we should not forget the environmental costs of these technologies). Efficiency gains therefore depend on LLMs eliminating the cost of human oversight, but LLMs can “hallucinate” incorrect answers, often informed by specious correlations drawn from lackluster data.More generally, AI is poorly suited to predicting low-probability but high-stakes events, and widespread reliance on such AI tools could result in more homogenous behavior that ends up undermining assumptions in the data that the tools were trained on.Because of these limitations, humans who are highly skilled in domain expertise should be kept in the loop to check the output of AI tools if that output is to be used in a high stakes risk management or portfolio construction situations (individuals without this domain expertise are more likely to fall prey to automation biases and defer to the model’s output unquestioningly).A combination of AI and human intelligence will often produce the most accurate answers, but that increased accuracy will be very expensive.",,0,html_body_unmatched
