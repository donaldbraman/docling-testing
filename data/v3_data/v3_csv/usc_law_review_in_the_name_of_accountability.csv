Those attempting to limit the reach of UE theory and government speech doctrine, whether in the courts, the political branches, or the realm of public debate, must understand that their appeal lies partly in their proponents’ insistence that the doctrines do not undercut accountability but in fact protect accountability. Highlighting the errors of that claim and the danger that the doctrines pose is one small but necessary step in any efforts to staunch their forward march.",,100.0,matched

2,INTRODUCTION,section_header,body_text,"Third, over the past several years, public school teachers—college and university professors as well as K–12 instructors—have faced a host of state laws barring them from conveying certain ideas about race or gender in the classroom.State and public school board defendants have leaned heavily on the government speech doctrine to justify the laws. To defend its restrictions on the instructional speech of public college professors, for example, the state of Florida asserted that the First Amendment “categorically does not apply” because such communications constitute “heartland government speech.”Defendants have also invoked accountability to bolster their government speech arguments. In the Florida litigation, for example, the state argued that anyone displeased with the restrictions on professorial speech could seek recourse “[at] the ballot box.”The laws’ proponents similarly invoke political accountability in their appeals to the public. For example, Nate Hochman, writing in the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal, characterized critics as “suggest[ing] that public educators should be insulated from accountability and democratic oversight.”Judicial responses to lawsuits challenging such restrictions have been mixed thus far. In cases involving college and university professors, courts have sided with plaintiffs, identifying an academic freedom exception toGarcettithat I discuss further in Part IV.Courts have been less favorable to plaintiffs in the K–12 educational setting, concluding that primary and secondary school teachers are subject toGarcetti’s rule.In the latter cases, however, plaintiffs have had some success in arguing that the laws are too vague to pass constitutional muster.",,83.33333333333334,matched
2,"The  Supreme  Court  has  increasingly  embraced  legal  doctrines  that empower elected officials to hide politically inconvenient information and ideas  from  the  American  people.  Two  lines  of  precedent  illuminate  this phenomenon and its reach across seemingly disparate areas of the case law. The first is a development in First Amendment law known as government speech doctrine and the closely related rule that public employees receive no First  Amendment  protection  for  their  work  product  speech-that  is,  for anything that they write or say while doing their jobs. This precedent puts at risk the ability of public employees or publicly subsidized experts-ranging from auditors hired to ferret out agency misconduct to scientists commissioned to study and report on changing climate patterns-to convey truthful  information  and  competent,  good  faith  analyses  consistent  with disciplinary  and  professional  norms.  The  second  line  of  precedent  is  the aspect of separation of powers law known as unitary executive theory ('UE theory,' 'UE,' or 'unity'). UE proponents argue that the president must fully control all discretionary executive activity in the United States, at minimum through an unfettered removal power. This jeopardizes the independence of federal  actors  who  are  charged  with  research  and  reporting  on  matters ranging from public corruption to public health.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched
2,"The two doctrines not only have similar impacts on information and analysis in the United States, but also share a common rationale: political accountability. Proponents of government speech doctrine emphasize that the people can respond to government speech at the ballot box, rewarding elected officials for speech that they like or punishing them when they dislike what they hear. As for UE theory, supporters emphasize that the president is the  only  elected  official  in  the  federal  executive  branch.  Indeed,  they describe  the  president  as  more  politically  accountable  than  anyone  else holding elected office in the United States, as the president alone is subject to  nationwide  election.  It  is  crucial,  they  argue,  that  the  president  alone exercises discretionary executive power so that the people know whom to blame or reward electorally for the use of such power. Similarly, they brush away concerns about presidential abuses by stressing the ability of the people to punish transgressions at the ballot box.",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

CONTEMPORARY THREATS TO SUBSTANTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY,section_header,body_text,"In Part I of this Article, I summarize the respective accountability-based cases for UE theory and government speech doctrine. I explain that each rationale is premised on a simplistic, formal vision of accountability. In contrast, I argue that substantive accountability, which is antithetical to UE theory and to broad interpretations of government speech doctrine, is more faithful to constitutional principles and more desirable as a practical matter. In Part II, I elaborate on and illustrate the points made in Part I by drawing from the major Supreme Court cases on UE theory and government speech doctrine. In Part III, I present several examples of how UE theory and government speech doctrine have been wielded in the courts and the political branches to undermine substantive accountability. In Part IV, I consider where the case law leaves openings to impose limits on each doctrine to preserve substantive accountability.",,75.0,matched
18,"In Part III, I present three sets of examples that span the period from the post-Watergate years to the earliest days of the second Trump Administration. In Section III.A, I look at the development of UE theory in the Department of Justice ('DOJ') during the late 1970s and 1980s and its use  by  the  Department  to  resist  post-Watergate  ethics  and  oversight measures. I observe that Donald Trump has picked up this mantle in more recent  years,  including  through  his  resistance  to  oversight  by  Inspectors General. In Section III.B, I look at the impact of both unity and government speech  doctrine  on  the  civil  service  more  broadly.  In  Section  III.B.1,  I discuss the relationship between the federal civil service and UE theory.

19,"The majority and dissenting opinions in Morrison reflected two very different ideas about unity and accountability. To the majority, written by Justice Rehnquist, the judicial mission was limited and functional: its role was not 'to define rigid categories' 76 but to ensure that legislation does not 'interfere impermissibly with [the president's] constitutional obligation to ensure  the  faithful  execution  of  the  laws.' 77 Among  the  factors  that Rehnquist cited to explain why the removal restriction passed this practical assessment,  it  'was  essential,  in  the  view  of  Congress,  to  establish  the necessary independence of the office,' an office that could be tasked with investigating the president or close advisors. 78 To  Justice  Scalia,  the  lone dissenter, the president possessed all the executive power-a conclusion that he  reached  by  interpreting  Article  II's  opening  words,  '[t]he  executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States,' to mean ' all of the  executive  power'-and  such  power  necessarily  entails  complete  and indefeasible  removal  authority. 79 As  for  the  risk  that  the  president  might abuse this power, Justice Scalia answered that 'the primary check against prosecutorial  abuse  is  a  political  one.  The  prosecutors  who  exercise  this awesome discretion are selected and can be removed by a President, whom the  people  have  trusted  enough  to  elect.' 80 Justice  Scalia's  vision  of accountability was so narrow that he treated the IC provisions, enacted by elected members of Congress and subject to presidential veto, as constitutionally  intolerable  because  they  might  subject  the  president  and their advisers to popular scrutiny. The provisions, Scalia said, 'weaken[] the Presidency  by  reducing  the  zeal  of  his  staff'  and  'enfeeble[]  him  more directly in his constant confrontations with Congress, by eroding his public support.' 81",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Currently, civil service laws protect federal employees who blow the whistle on bad acts including illegality, waste, and abuse. 97 These protections would be compromised should an administration assert, and even more so should courts agree, that such legislation cannot constitutionally prevent the president from removing, at will, anyone who exercises discretionary executive power.

It adds that any power held by federal employees 'is delegated by the President,' and that employees 'must be accountable to the President, who  is  the  only  member  of  the  executive  branch,  other  than  the  Vice President,  elected  and  directly  accountable  to  the  American  people.' 104 Fittingly,  the  idea  behind  Schedule  F  during  Trump's  first  administration originated in a memorandum  suggesting  that Trump  '[e]xplore the 'Constitutional  Option'  for  firing  federal  employees,' 105 and  that  civil service protections might be unconstitutional. 106",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Indeed, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the Court in a 2010 case, noted that “[n]othing in [its] opinion . . . should be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially known as the civil service system within independent agencies.”Roberts observed that many civil servants “would not qualify as ‘Officers of the United States’ who ‘exercise significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States;’ ” accordingly, they may not “be subject to the same sort of [presidential] control.”In a future case, the Court could decide the question that it has left open and affirm the constitutionality validity of civil service tenure protections. To its reasoning about the limited scope of civil servants’ roles, the Court might add one about the work that they do perform. Namely, much of it entails the production of knowledge that reflects expertise and evidence-based analysis—for example, generating scientific reports or undertaking audits or inspections. Such work creates much of the factual backdrop against which the public and other branches can judge elected officials.

30,CONCLUSION,section_header,body_text,"The majority and dissenting opinions inMorrisonreflected two very different ideas about unity and accountability. To the majority, written by Justice Rehnquist, the judicial mission was limited and functional: its role was not “to define rigid categories”but to ensure that legislation does not “interfere impermissibly with [the president’s] constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”Among the factors that Rehnquist cited to explain why the removal restriction passed this practical assessment, it “was essential, in the view of Congress, to establish the necessary independence of the office,” an office that could be tasked with investigating the president or close advisors.To Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter, the president possessed all the executive power—a conclusion that he reached by interpreting Article II’s opening words, “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States,” to mean “all ofthe executive power”—and such power necessarily entails complete and indefeasible removal authority.As for the risk that the president might abuse this power, Justice Scalia answered that “the primary check against prosecutorial abuse is a political one. The prosecutors who exercise this awesome discretion are selected and can be removed by a President, whom the people have trusted enough to elect.”Justice Scalia’s vision of accountability was so narrow that he treated the IC provisions, enacted by elected members of Congress and subject to presidential veto, as constitutionally intolerable because they might subject the president and their advisers to popular scrutiny. The provisions, Scalia said, “weaken[] the Presidency by reducing the zeal of his staff” and “enfeeble[] him more directly in his constant confrontations with Congress, by eroding his public support.”",,100.0,matched

,,,,"The Supreme Court has increasingly embraced legal doctrines that empower elected officials to hide politically inconvenient information and ideas from the American people. Two lines of precedent illuminate this phenomenon and its reach across seemingly disparate areas of the case law. The first is a development in First Amendment law known as government speech doctrine and the closely related rule that public employees receive no First Amendment protection for their work product speech—that is, for anything that they write or say while doing their jobs. This precedent puts at risk the ability of public employees or publicly subsidized experts—ranging from auditors hired to ferret out agency misconduct to scientists commissioned to study and report on changing climate patterns—to convey truthful information and competent, good faith analyses consistent with disciplinary and professional norms. The second line of precedent is the aspect of separation of powers law known as unitary executive theory (“UE theory,” “UE,” or “unity”). UE proponents argue that the president must fully control all discretionary executive activity in the United States, at minimum through an unfettered removal power. This jeopardizes the independence of federal actors who are charged with research and reporting on matters ranging from public corruption to public health.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The two doctrines not only have similar impacts on information and analysis in the United States, but also share a common rationale: political accountability. Proponents of government speech doctrine emphasize that the people can respond to government speech at the ballot box, rewarding elected officials for speech that they like or punishing them when they dislike what they hear. As for UE theory, supporters emphasize that the president is the only elected official in the federal executive branch. Indeed, they describe the president as more politically accountable than anyone else holding elected office in the United States, as the president alone is subject to nationwide election. It is crucial, they argue, that the president alone exercises discretionary executive power so that the people know whom to blame or reward electorally for the use of such power. Similarly, they brush away concerns about presidential abuses by stressing the ability of the people to punish transgressions at the ballot box.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A more robust vision of accountability—one that I label “substantive accountability”—recognizes that accountability “is a ‘they,’ not an ‘it.’ ”Indeed, the casting of a single vote for an official—even assuming the opportunity to vote for or against them again some number of years later—is too blunt an instrument to constitute considered approval of all manner of decision whether big or small, technical or non-technical, anticipated or unanticipated. Rather, holding officials accountable entails countless acts over time, ranging from legislative oversight to internal and external whistleblowing to fearless investigative journalism. All of these acts—including, but not limited to, voting—require the gathering and exchange of information and ideas. In the longer-term, they require a knowledge ecosystem that reliably produces such communications and supports a citizenry capable of assessing them. If one’s goal is substantive accountability, then government speech doctrine and UE theory are woefully inadequate to achieve it. To the contrary, they profoundly undermine it, especially when they are interpreted broadly.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Proponents of UE theory and government speech doctrine assume a very simplistic vision of government accountability. In the case of UE theory, they suggest that because the president is the only elected member of the executive branch, he alone can be accountable to the people in executing the law.Thus, UE proponents bolster their textual and historical arguments—which I and others have discussed elsewhereand which I address briefly in Part II—by suggesting that accountability is a core reason why text and history dictate a unitary executive,and that accountability independently demands a unitary executive.Proponents elaborate further on presidential accountability by comparing the president not only to unelected bureaucrats, but also to members of Congress. Although the latter are elected, the argument goes, the president alone is subject to election by the entire nation through the Electoral College.

If, on the other hand, the expression’s government source is obscured . . . then political accountability provides no meaningful safeguard.”Although the Supreme Court has said that it might weigh public perception among other factors to determine whether speech is private or public,the Court has developed no “reliable method” to gauge it.To make matters worse, the other factors that the Court considers—such as the extent of government control over speech—can themselves undermine accountability if they are not accompanied by authorship transparency.",,0,html_body_unmatched

For example, suppose that political appointees pressured civil servant scientists in an agency to bury or skew research findings that cast doubt on the feasibility of a presidential initiative. In the short run, such intimidation might prevent the public from hearing the unvarnished views of scientists on an electorally salient matter. In the longer run, the pressure campaign—particularly if it were not an isolated incident—might drive highly qualified scientists from the affected agency and deter others from serving in the first place.

Two categories of cases raise especially tough questions. The first entails restrictions that fall on speech that can plausibly be characterized as private, rather than governmental speech. For example, the Supreme Court held inWalker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veteransthat specialty license plates in Texas, even those designed by private groups to reflect private hobbies and interests, constitute government speech.Dissenting on behalf of himself and three other justices, Justice Alito lamented the Court’s “capacious understanding of government speech” that “threatens private speech that government finds displeasing.”Sounding a similar alarm, Mary-Rose Papandrea wrote thatWalkerput “the Court’s growing deference to government institutional actors . . . on steroids, allowing the government to disfavor private speech in the name of protecting its image.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

The president’s supervisory authority encompassesallof the activities of his executive branch subordinates, whether those activities be technical or non-technical in nature.”The OLC further stressed the categorical nature of the president’s authority by quoting a 1982 OLC opinion to the effect that the president’s “ultimate control over subordinate officials . . . includes the right to supervise and review [their] work . . .including reports issuedeitherto the publicor to Congress.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

United States, decided just nine years afterMyers, the Court deemedMyers’ holding limited to “purely executive officers.”In two 1980s cases—Bowsher v. SynarandMorrison v.

This is true, for example, of unity proponents’ over-reading of founding-era arguments linking constitutional and statutory provisions to accountability. Proponents tend to leap from highly case-specific founding era arguments to a broad, acontextual constitutional unity directive, a move enabled by their fixation on formal, rather than substantive accountability.This phenomenon is illustrated by unity proponents’ use of the founding era decision not to append an advisory council to the president.

Enacted in the wake of Watergate, the Act was an effort to confront public corruption, in part by creating an independent counsel (“IC”) with some degree of distance from presidential control. The Act’s IC provisions were responsive to fears that presidents would, as Richard Nixon had done, interfere with Justice Department investigations in which they could be implicated. Olson challenged these provisions partly on the basis that the IC was incompatible with a unitary executive because the IC did not serve at the president’s pleasure. Instead, the IC could be terminated only by the Attorney General (“AG”), who herself is subject to at-will dismissal by the president.

CitingMyers, Harmon called this an “improper restriction on the President’s exclusive power to remove Presidentially appointed executive officers.”Harmon also objected to the IG’s statutory “obligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed” and the related “requirement that [the IG] provide any additional information or documents requested by Congress . . . without executive branch clearance or approval.”In Harmon’s view, these informing rules interfere with the president’s “general administrative control over those executing the laws,” which “includes the right to coordinate and supervise all replies and comments from the executive branch to Congress.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

As I elaborate in Part IV, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that courts would allow presidents to bypass civil service protections on unitary executive grounds. It is possible, however, that courts would indeed extend the logic of the Roberts Court removal cases so far.

Recall, for example, the OLC’s 1988 opinion to the effect that Congress may not require executive branch personnel to distribute even highly technical information without a chance for presidential intervention.Furthermore, to the extent that some such speech falls within the terms of federal whistleblower protection laws,it is vulnerable to the same unity-based threats as that faced by federal whistleblowers more broadly.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Unity can enable much more than the blocking of isolated pieces of information and analysis. It can have a deep, long-range impact by thinning out the ranks of the civil service, enabling the president to fill and potentially fire large swaths of the federal workforce previously designated as nonpartisan merit hires. As noted, it is by no means inevitable that courts would sign off on such sweeping changes. Existing case law does, however, open the door to such a possibility, and at minimum, it can embolden presidents to test the boundaries of precedent by trying to initiate such action.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Donald Trump seems determined to push the limits of a president’s power to politicize the federal workforce. On the first day of his new administration, January 20, 2025, he issued an executive order (“EO”) reinstating the so-called “Schedule F” order that he had issued in the waning days of his first administration.The EO authorizes the transition of potentially tens of thousands of career positions throughout the federal workforce into political appointments.In its purpose section and even its title, the EO projects confidence that it is permitted, even demanded, by unity and accountability.The EO is entitled “Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce,” and it asserts that the president has “sole and exclusive authority over the executive branch.” It adds that any power held by federal employees “is delegated by the President,” and that employees “must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people.”Fittingly, the idea behind Schedule F during Trump’s first administration originated in a memorandum suggesting that Trump “[e]xplore the ‘Constitutional Option’ for firing federal employees,”and that civil service protections might be unconstitutional.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"There is also an obvious kinship between the EO’s reliance on the notion of presidential accountability and Trump’s longstanding rhetoric about the abuses of the so-called “deep state.”As Donald Moynihan writes, “Trump was not just antagonistic toward the career public service: this hostility was central to his political identity. He had openly campaigned against the ‘deep state.’ ”The EO’s own language frames it as a reaction to “numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,” and as a “restor[ation of] accountability to the career civil service.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As noted earlier, the reason why federal employees are rarely able to invoke the First Amendment to sue their employers directly is because the Supreme Court held in 1983’sBush v. Lucasthat the federal civil service laws preclude such suits.TheLucasCourt expressed confidence that Congress would protect whistleblowers.It did not, apparently, anticipate a future in which whistleblower protection laws might themselves be overtaken by aggressive interpretations of UE theory. Even on their own terms, such laws have not reliably served as the “powerful network” that theGarcettiCourt assured would protect whistleblowers in lieu of robust first amendment protections.For example, at the time that the Court decidedGarcetti, federal whistleblower protection law contained the same hole that",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"Although state and local employees can invoke their First Amendment rights directly, those rights have been narrowed considerably by courts, particularly through the government speech doctrine andGarcetti. Furthermore, as we have seen, the notion underlying a broad government speech doctrine—that public employee speech is rightly, even necessarily subject to political control—also has substantial political currency. That political appeal—coupled with legislators and executive officers feeling emboldened by the state of the case law—have helped give rise to a number of restrictive policies, ranging from sweeping public employee gag rules to legislation micro-managing the classroom speech of public school teachers. In this Section, I discuss three examples of such measures: post-hoc discipline for employee speech, prior restraints on employee communications with the media, and laws targeting public school educators in particular.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Second, although there is a sound basis to conclude thatGarcettidoes not license agencies to impose sweeping prior restraints on employee speech,and some courts indeed have struck down such policies,there remain scores of federal, state, and local directives that bar employees across multiple agencies from speaking to reporters without authorization. A 2019 report by the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information at the University of Florida found “dozens of examples of policies that either forbid government employees from speaking to journalists at all, or require that they obtain a supervisor’s permission before doing so.”Such policies persist in part because “Garcettifueled a mindset among government managers and their counsel that the courts would view restrictions on employee speech deferentially.”The political currency of the notion underlyingGarcettiand government speech doctrine more broadly—that agency employees can be made to speak in one voice, dictated by political leadership—plays an important role as well.",,0,html_body_unmatched

This includes the constitutionality of the limited removal restrictions that currently apply to IGs and of the still more ambitious proposals to provide IGs with for-cause protection from removal.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As for government speech doctrine, the case law contains the seeds of an important limiting principle that I call the anti-distortion doctrine. It amounts to a wariness of conditions on state-sponsored knowledge production that would distort the nature of the sponsored programs or their communicative outputs. Perhaps the most overt use of the principle occurs in the 2001 case ofLegal Services v. Velazquez.TheVelazquezCourt invalidated a law restricting the types of arguments that congressionally funded legal services attorneys could make in litigation.The Court observed that Congress had funded the attorneys not to transmit government speech but rather to represent private clients.Having done so, Congress could not limit the stock of arguments from which the attorneys could draw to advise and to advocate for their clients. Such a limit, said the Court, “distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys” as zealous advocates for their clients.Among the problems with such distortion is that it “prohibits speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
