1,"In  a  post-#MeToo  workplace,  harassment  remains  pervasive,  and harassment law still fails to provide protection for the harms experienced by many workers-particularly those in the most vulnerable jobs. Even when reform  efforts  are  introduced  through  legislation,  courts,  and  agency guidance, it often does not provide greater power, autonomy, and dignity to women in ways that would more meaningfully protect them from workplace abuse. We are the first to create a database of state legislation, including over three thousand bills, that allows us to empirically analyze the extent to which lawmakers comprehensively address harassment following the rise of the  #MeToo  movement.  We  assess  comprehensiveness  by  examining  how responsive legislation is to existing gaps in legal protection during the five years following the 2017 tweet that took #MeToo activism global, relative to the 2016 baseline period. We found that states introduced a wide breadth of reforms  to  combat  harassment  and  gender  inequality,  including  some changes that address longstanding gaps in legal protection. Gaps persist, however, and in some cases worsened post #MeToo. Going forward, reform efforts  by  state  legislatures -and all legal stakeholders -will  prove  most effective if they move away from narrow conceptions of sexual harassment and follow the voice of workers, pursuing a broad, multi-layered agenda",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

This is less discussed than the harassment that is driven by sexual desire and targets  low-status  women.

Although some employees quit or are fired in connection with workplace harassment, many harassment victims continue to work throughout the abuse, making them ineligible for back pay. Ironically, staying longer and enduring more prolonged harassment and abuse may end up resulting in lower damages. This is particularly problematic for low-wage workers who are economically vulnerable and cannot afford to quit their jobs. Conversely, if the employee was terminated, reinstatement may not be a useful remedy, as the plaintiff may be reluctant to return to an abusive workplace. Compensatory and punitive damages, along with attorneys’ fees and costs, may be the most important forms of relief available to harassment claimants. Yet, damage caps force courts and juries to limit relief to the plaintiffs to whom they might have made a much larger award to compensate for pain and suffering and to punish the employer for maintaining a hostile work environment.",,100.0,matched

58,CONCLUSION,section_header,body_text,"In a post-#MeToo workplace, harassment remains pervasive, and harassment law still fails to provide protection for the harms experienced by many workers—particularly those in the most vulnerable jobs. Even when reform efforts are introduced through legislation, courts, and agency guidance, it often does not provide greater power, autonomy, and dignity to women in ways that would more meaningfully protect them from workplace abuse. We are the first to create a database of state legislation, including over three thousand bills, that allows us to empirically analyze the extent to which lawmakers comprehensively address harassment following the rise of the #MeToo movement. We assess comprehensiveness by examining how responsive legislation is to existing gaps in legal protection during the five years following the 2017 tweet that took #MeToo activism global, relative to the 2016 baseline period. We found that states introduced a wide breadth of reforms to combat harassment and gender inequality, including some changes that address longstanding gaps in legal protection. Gaps persist, however, and in some cases worsened post #MeToo. Going forward, reform efforts by state legislatures—and all legal stakeholders—will prove most effective if they move away from narrow conceptions of sexual harassment and follow the voice of workers, pursuing a broad, multi-layered agenda around gender equity that is responsive to the realities of our evolving workplace and society. This is especially true in 2025 as the Trump administration redirects the EEOC’s resources towards attacking diversity, equity and inclusion measures.",,80.0,matched

,,,,"Tarana Burke coined the phrase “Me Too” in 2006 in support of Black women and girls of color who had survived sexual violence, encouraging them to share their stories despite the many pressures they faced to remain silent.Social media galvanized the movement in 2017 after Alyssa Milano took to Twitter, posting: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet . . . ‘we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.’ ”The #MeToohashtag was used 19 million times between 2017 and 2018.Sustained digital participation increased the movement’s visibility and maintained its momentum beyond the boom and bust trend typically observed on social media.Online engagement surrounding the #MeToo movement also served as a catalyst for offline action, evolving into highly publicized protests, employee walkouts, and historic strikes.For example, in 2018, McDonald’s employees organized a historic multi-state strike against the company’s sexual harassment policies.Protesting workers wrote “#MeToo” on signs and covered their mouths with tape, bridging the gap between social media activism and traditional means of protest.After union-led campaigns and employee-staged walkouts, prominent companies in industries from technology to hospitality changed existing workplace policies such as mandatory arbitration.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"This Article focuses primarily on state legislation because virtually all reform activity during the sample period occurred at the state level. Harassment law and gender-based reforms more broadly tend to follow a similar pattern of state-led rights protection and enhancement due to the gradual trend of federal courts contracting civil rights in the workplace among other venues. Federal lower courts, in particular, have increasingly issued employer-friendly Title VII and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) decisions that have been both formally and informally codified into law.Congressional gridlock has also led to a standstill with respect to anti-harassment legislation.Moreover, extreme partisanship in both Congress and the judiciary diminishes the likelihood of relying on Congress to act as a check when courts roll back rights, as they have in the past.Only six federal reforms related to harassment and workplace gender equity passed during the five years following #MeToo; of those, only two had system-wide effects: the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 and the Speak Out Act of 2022. By contrast, states have been a hotbed of legislative activity.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Thus, states now, more than ever, remain important “laboratories of democracy,” a term Justice Brandeis coined in 1932, for achieving nationwide rights’ protection.A close look at state legislative activity reveals the state-specific innovation and experimentation apparent in the variety of bills introduced. Nevertheless, the path from state-specific legislative innovation to systemic federal reform is not linear. Rather, broader effects depend on state-specific efforts influencing a combination of players from different arenas, including state courts, state agencies, federal courts, executive action, and even voluntary action by private entities.",,0,html_body_unmatched

While high-profile support for these kinds of reforms did catch the attention of state legislators, with many bills introduced and passed, state legislators also introduced and passed many bills addressing systemic issues such as pay equity, leave law, and reforms to fill gaps in protection left in the legal landscape prior to #MeToo.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,This Part provides an overview of the underlying social determinants that yield high rates of workplace harassment over time.,,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As various scholars have argued, harassment is not principally about sexual desire, but rather a reflection of the distribution of power within the particular workplace and society more broadly.It is a form of social behavior that reflects the dominant group’s—in this case men’s—ability to exclude, marginalize, or dominate less powerful individuals within the workplace.It can often function to undermine the competence and confidence of marginalized groups and interfere with work performance, while also setting the norm of what is accepted or acceptable behavior.Even harassment that is motivated in whole or in part by sexual desire reflects the perpetrator’s power to impose his demands and desires on others who are poorly positioned to rebuff those demands without consequence.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Harassment therefore serves as a mirror for systemic hierarchy, within the microcosm of the workplace and within the culture and larger historical context of a nation. The subordination of women was a central feature of nineteenth and twentieth century law and work arrangements. Women lost their legal personhood upon marriage through a principle known as coverture, wherein they could only acquire property or sign contracts through the legal personhood of their husbands.Women did not secure the constitutional right to vote until 1920.Many factories in the early decades of the twentieth century were explicitly segregated by gender, with women and men working in separate departments at separate pay rates, eating in separate cafeterias, and even entering and exiting from different entrances or on separate schedules.Until 1974, banks could deny loans and credit cards to married women unless their husbands co-signed the application.The legal and social foundation of the United States is one where men have power over women, are superior in status, and are free to control them.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"America’s history of slavery, segregation, and white supremacy is also inextricably intertwined with the history of work, which shapes the experiences of Black and other racialized women.Slavery was in part a workplace hierarchy predicated on violence and white supremacy.Black women were chattel assets, whose purpose in the economy and social order was to labor and serve white slave masters and their families.White slave masters frequently raped them, bred them to produce more workers, and subjected them to physical and psychological terror to maintain control.After slaves were emancipated, segregation became a workplace reality, with Black women being relegated to the most menial and low-wage jobs.Title VII offered reform, but it did not fully dismantle job segregation and workplace hierarchies predicated on white privilege.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Immigrant workers in the United States have also faced shifting, yet persistent, forms of discrimination. Although immigrants in the nineteenth and early twentieth century received privileged treatment compared with Black workers,there is a long history of discrimination and subordination of immigrant populations, particularly Latino and Asian Americans. These include, for example, the Chinese Exclusion Actand the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, which kept Asian women workers excluded, marginalized, and exploited.Continued subordination of both Black and immigrant women is also evidenced by the exclusion of domestic and agricultural workers from the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act and the 1935 National Labor Relations Act.These positions are overwhelmingly occupied by immigrant women and Black women, and many are still excluded from these legal protections today, making them more vulnerable to discrimination and abuse. Further, while Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin, employers are permitted to discriminate against workers on the basis of immigration status.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Workers who belong to more than one subordinated group—such as Black women, immigrant women of color, or Black immigrant women—face compounded marginalization, as Kimberlé Crenshaw originally argued in her landmark article on intersectionality.Such discrimination is also replete within the historical record, in which a combination of race and sex-based discrimination operated in tandem. For example, the legislative history of Title VII suggests “sex” was included as a protected category based in part on arguments that protecting race, but not sex, would give Black women an advantage over White women.Likewise, during debates in the 1970s over whether to finally include domestic workers in the federal minimum wage law, opponents painted the work itself—performed primarily by women of color—as undeserving of minimum wage, while the White housewives who employed them were depicted as unqualified to calculate wages and hours.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Throughout United States history, women and people of color have also been vastly underrepresented in Congress, as well as within state legislatures.Underrepresentation of these groups as lawmakers—both now and historically—reinforce hierarchies and subordination over time, by affecting which types of bills get introduced and passed, and which end up on the cutting room floor. Representation can shape values, priorities, and debate around who is deemed worthy of protection, in what ways, and whether legal interventions are needed to reduce inequality. Men—specifically White men—are also markedly overrepresented in the judiciary, where the laws are enforced.The life experiences and perspectives of the judiciary affects their approach to cases and the parties with whom they identify. Biases influenced by one’s social position can then get baked into precedent, which later constrains and influences subsequent rulings.Thus, lack of representation in both legislatures and courts can facilitate and exacerbate gaps in the law, ultimately failing to provide accountability and leaving women workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Hispanic women earn fifty-seven cents for every dollar earned by White, non-Hispanic men.In 2020, Black women earned sixty-four cents for every dollar earned by White, non-Hispanic men.Over time, this gap fuels income and wealth disparities; Black women are estimated to lose nearly one million dollars over the course of their careers.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Relatedly, broad societal hierarchies and unevenly distributed power within organizations also affect workplace culture, behavior, and policies.Power can take many forms; however, economic power or lack thereof tends to be at the foundation. Thus, when one’s labor is devalued—as occurs most substantially with Black and Hispanic women wage gaps compared with White, non-Hispanic men—this fundamentally affects the bargaining power one has with respect to protecting themselves from harassment at work.Economic disparities in bargaining power are compounded by continuing racism and sexism in low-wage industries where women of color are overrepresented.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The EEOC has published a list of workplace conditions that increase the likelihood of harassment. The vast majority of the conditions noted are common features of low-wage industries.For example, low-wage and precarious industries such as hospitality, food service, modeling, agriculture, construction, and custodial work often: (1) lack effective policies and procedures; (2) have minimal to no oversight; (3) require working in isolation; and (4) prioritize customer and client well-being over the worker.It is thus unsurprising that the women working in these industries experience the highest rates of harassment, among other forms of workplace violence.For example, surveys have found that 65% of casino workers reported unwanted touching by guests, while over half of restaurant workers reported sexual harassment as occurring on a weekly basis.One casino worker described how the harassment was intertwined with her wages, stating that a guest wanted to “put the tip on [her] ass” and took back the tip when she refused.Another worker, this time at a hotel, described having to jump over the beds to escape the room of a guest who exposed themselves to her while requesting shampoo.COVID-19 has only worsened these rates; one nationwide study found that 78% of surveyed restaurant workers reported an increase in hostility and harassment as they enforced COVID-19-related policies.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Harrowing accounts of harassment are also extremely prevalent among domestic workers and farmworkers, who are among the least protected due to the working conditions and the historical factors discussed above. Studies have found that 48% of domestic workers have had clients expose themselves, while 80% of farmworkers have experienced some form of sexual violence while at work.In many of these cases, low-wage workers’ bargaining power is further diminished by language barriers or distrust of government agencies due to immigration status.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Gender and racial hierarchies also shape who has access to leadership positions that hold power in the workplace and in government. For example, women and people of color remain vastly underrepresented within business leadership ranks.These statistics remain stubbornly sticky despite nearly sixty years of anti-discrimination law under Title VII. Reviewing decades of national employment data, sociologists Kevin Stainback and Donald Tomaskovic-Devey found that Black men and women, as well as White women, made far fewer gains in managerial jobs than in professional jobs.White men retained a disproportionate share of managerial jobs, which these authors attributed to continued White male advantage that led them to be “pushed up in organizational hierarchies.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Women also face gender-based harassment even when they break social and historical norms and move up to the top of the power hierarchy. In these cases, social and historical hierarchies are disrupted, and men resist and engage in demeaning behaviors to restore the status quo. Sociologist Raewyn Connell might characterize the problem in terms of “hegemonic masculinity”—“practice[s] . . . that allowed men’s dominance over women to continue,” that “embod[y] the currently most honored way of being a man” and “requir[e] all other men to position themselves in relation to it,” and that “ideologically legitimat[e] the global subordination of women to men.”This type of harassment is not necessarily sexual in nature and can consist of taunting, insubordination, and use of demeaning slurs and images. This is less discussed than the harassment that is driven by sexual desire and targets low-status women. However, at its core, it is driven by systemic power hierarchies that exploit women or justify their differential treatment, similar to other types of harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A poignant example are the numerous accounts of workplace harassment in law enforcement and the military. In 2018, it was reported that almost 25% of women in active-duty military experienced sexual harassment while in the military.For women veterans, the percentage who reported experiencing sexual harassment rises to 80%, suggesting underreporting may be a significant problem for the military.One particularly horrifying example comes from a female Navy lieutenant. In 1992, she went public with a personal story of being sexually assaulted by “the gauntlet,” which was described as a “nightly, coordinated, and systematic sexual assault of women who found themselves on the third floor of the hotel.”High rates of harassment are also commonplace in law enforcement. One nationally representative survey of law enforcement officers found that 71% of female law enforcement officers have experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence in the workplace.These male-dominated environments are high-risk, as women are devalued and targeted for breaking gender stereotypes and hierarchies of power.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Based on historical and current social realities, we argue that harassment is a workplace hazard that is disproportionately distributed to women—particularly low-wage workers and women of color—creating a health and safety issue with civil rights and economic justice issues at the core. As such, harassment is best suited to be addressed by a multi-layered hazard prevention model, such as the Swiss Cheese Model we proposed above.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Workplace harassment frequently occurs with, and may even precipitate, other forms of workplace violence.Physical violence can occur in any workplace and among any type of worker, even women in leadership; but the risk for fatal violence is highest among sales, protective service, and transportation workers, while the risk for nonfatal violence resulting in days away from work is greatest for healthcare and social assistance workers.For women working in low-wage industries, the economic harms associated with workplace harassment can be particularly devastating. Economic violence can take many forms such as constructive discharge or retaliation for reporting or opposing workplace harassment, and can occur via termination, demotion, pay cuts, wage theft, or detrimental changes to job terms and conditions such as scheduling.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The detrimental effects of harassment are dangerously cyclical, leaving victims at risk of remaining stuck in these cycles. Like other health and safety hazards, preventing harassment demand multifaceted interventions, and many gaps remain. In Section II, we identify these gaps before turning to our data, which we analyze to examine the effectiveness of the overall policy response post #MeToo.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Title VII contains no reference to the word “harassment.” Harassment law is instead a product of regulatory and judicial interpretation of the statutory language stating it is unlawful for an employer “to discriminate . . . with respect to . . . conditions, or privileges of employment.”Lower courts began to recognize racial, religious and sex-based harassment claims in the 1970s,while the EEOC recognized sexual harassment as a form of discrimination in 1980.The Supreme Court first solidified the cause of action in the 1986 decision,Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson.The foundation set forth inMeritorwould be elaborated in subsequent Supreme Court rulings.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In this Part, we discuss ten major limitations of harassment doctrine, which leave significant gaps and fail to protect many women who are subjected to harassment at work. If the laws are ineffective, this leaves many victims without remedy, while also failing to deter future harassment due to the lack of accountability, weak enforcement of existing law, and restricted access to justice. In Part III, we examine whether the flurry of state reforms during the height of the #MeToo movement began to acknowledge and address these gaps to meaningfully improve protection for working women. In the absence of federal reform, state reform serves as both a laboratory of innovation as well as a way to gauge bipartisan support.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As early as 1986 inMeritor v. Vinson, the Supreme Court imposed a compartmentalized frame on harassment cases, treating it as a matter of individual offenders and targeted victims as opposed to broader systemic harms in an organization.Meritor v. Vinsonwas brought by a Black woman, Mechelle Vinson, against her bank employer. Vinson was subject to sexual advances and repeated demands for sexual favors, fondled in front of other workers, followed to the restroom, and forcibly raped on several occasions by the bank vice president.The bank had a grievance procedure, but it would have required Vinson to report the misconduct to her supervisor—the perpetrator of the harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"From the outset, the Court failed to assess Vinson’s story comprehensively. It treated her harassment as an isolated circumstance and refused to consider the evidence of harassment other women at the bank were experiencing alongside Vinson as relevant to the question of whether the harasser cultivated an environment that violates Title VII.This was despite the lower court’s holding that even where a woman is not the object of harassment herself, there may be a valid Title VII claim if the atmosphere fostered pervasive harassment. Instead, Justice Rehnquist concluded that the District Court did not allow the presentation of a “wholesale evidence of a pattern and practice relating to sexual advances to other female employees in her case in chief.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This blinkered view of harassment is at odds with the concept of a hostile work environment, which can pervade and impact the workplace beyond one individual victim. The Court’s individualized approach also represents a marked departure from other claims available under Title VII. As early as the 1971 case ofGriggs v. Dukes, the Court acknowledged that discrimination can operate systemically within a workplace and therefore permitted a wide variety of evidence from multiple sources.In these Title VII discrimination cases, including “disparate impact,” “pattern or practice,” or “systemic” cases, the law acknowledges group offenses, even if individual experiences of discrimination vary and are effectuated by multiple actors and systems within an organization.Consequently, the Court does not begin from the presumption that discrimination is limited to a single bad actor within the organization who has engaged in misconduct targeting a single individual.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Courts further compound the individuation of harassment claims through the routine enforcement of settlement and severance agreements containing non-disclosure provisions.Such non-disclosure provisions conceal harassment, making it difficult to detect and root out patterns of abuse.Settlement agreements commonly include non-disclosure provisions, and employers and their counsel often refuse to settle a case without some form of confidentiality provision. While some victims may want confidentiality,this requirement often pressures victims to sign and remain silent in order to achieve some type of closure. This manner in which non-disclosure provisions are included in settlement agreements serves to limit collective grievances, opportunities to negotiate, and accountability for repeat perpetrators and organizations that foster hostile work environments.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Access to legal justice under Title VII has also historically been barred for many workers by mandatory arbitration provisions. Approximately 56% of non-union private sector workers are required to sign mandatory private arbitration agreements,which represents roughly sixty million American workers.Of those, 30% have signed agreements that include class-action waivers.Arbitration agreements have become particularly prevalent since the 2011 Supreme Court ruling,AT&T v. Concepcion, which enabled companies to enforce class and collective action waivers through arbitration.Arbitration agreements divert claims from the public court system to private arbitration, in which neither the filings, rulings, nor proceedings are open to the public.Even if the arbitration agreement does not require the victim to maintain the secrecy of the proceedings, arbitration is to a much greater extent shielded from public view, including media coverage and scholarly research.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Arbitration often offers poor remedies for the plaintiffs. When the arbitration agreement includes a class action waiver, the employee cannot file a collective claim in court or in arbitration, forcing them to bring an individual claim no matter the fact pattern.Arbitration also offers few avenues for appeal, leaving workers little recourse if the arbitrator issues a bad ruling. Arbitration can further inhibit access to justice because claimants then have difficulty finding a lawyer willing to file a claim in arbitration when the deck is so heavily stacked against them. Research shows women of color are more likely to be denied access to courts than White women, due to mandatory arbitration.This is because of the particular prevalence of these clauses in low-wage industries where women of color are overrepresented.Thus, low-wage workers, who are already uniquely vulnerable to workplace violations including harassment and retaliation, suffer the most from contracts restricting their ability to access a court of law.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Many workers are not covered by key antidiscrimination and labor law statutes, leaving them with no legal recourse regardless of the merits of the claim. Title VII only covers claims against “employers,” and by extension claims brought by “employees.”This coverage restriction means that independent contractors lack any form of protection under Title VII. Independent contractors make up over a third of the nation’s workforce,and almost half of these unprotected independent contractors are women.Many of these are low-paid jobs in industries such as personal services, transportation, and educational services.Women of color frequently land in these jobs due to the low barriers to entry, discrimination in other parts of the labor market, and the need for supplemental income.Research has shown that women and people of color are also overrepresented in most industries that tend to misclassify their workers as independent contractors.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Undocumented workers are nominally covered by Title VII,but the law does not prohibit workers from being fired—or deported—for their immigration status.These workers are also unlikely to be awarded back pay due to their immigration status, which reduces the legal risk for employers.Immigrant workers make up a majority of the workforce in specific industries, including agricultural work.In these cases, the threat of termination or deportation largely cuts off any meaningful access to justice and makes them particularly vulnerable targets for harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Coverage gaps that predominantly affect women of color and immigrants are no historical accident.As previously discussed, occupations in which women of color and immigrants predominated were intentionally excluded from landmark federal employment legislation in the twentieth century.Employers have continued to treat women of color both as invisible and as their labor to control. Roles like nannies and maids are disproportionately held by immigrant women of color, traditionally employed in private homes of the mostly White middleand upper-class, where a lack of transparency and adequate oversight gives employers the liberty to take advantage of these workers.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The legal standard for Title VII retaliation claims, which requires the plaintiffs to show that the retaliatory conduct was “materially adverse,” fails to deter low-level and informal retaliation.Most courts find neither ostracizing nor harassing conduct to rise to the level of an adverse employment action for purposes of a retaliation claim under Title VII.They construe the harm as not significant enough to deter someone from filing a charge.Courts have even held that a negative performance review is not sufficiently “material” to support a retaliation claim.And, as previously noted, judges with lifetime or fixed-term appointments may not recognize the threat that would deter a reasonable worker who lacks such security. One study, for example, revealed that many of the employment actions courts have held not “materially adverse” would actually dissuade participants from reporting.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The threat of retaliation can be a particularly powerful deterrent for marginalized populations.Underrepresented groups within a particular workplace—such as women in non-traditional occupations, or women of color in majority White occupations—have less access to internal social networks and political capital within the workplace, which both increases the likelihood and the detrimental effect of informal social sanctions. The fear of job loss and unemployment for a low-wage worker can be so economically threatening to the employee’s livelihood that it deters them from reporting even extreme misconduct. Concerns about retaliatory deportation can weigh even more heavily on an employee’s decision-making. Moreover, even where actual retaliation is absent, workplace culture that fosters the threat of retaliation alone can deter victims from reporting.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Fears about retaliation for at-will employees who complain about harassment are particularly well-founded, despite whatever assurances human resources may provide about the company’s policy regarding retaliation. Even though retaliation for speaking up against harassment and discrimination is prohibited by law, it is a common workplace reality.Complainants may face formal action, such as termination, demotion, or pay cuts, as well as informal social sanctions. These repercussions originate not only from the perpetrator, but also from co-workers or supervisors who side with the perpetrator or perceive the complaint as disruptive. Studies have demonstrated that these negative consequences, such as being ostracized by coworkers, more often than not follow harassment reports.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Title VII’s administrative filing requirement imposes a notably short time window—less than a year—for the plaintiffs to bring a harassment claim. Before Title VII claimants can file a lawsuit against an employer, they must file an administrative claim with the EEOC within 180 days of the last occurrence of harassment.Any lawsuit brought by an employee that has failed to timely file an administrative claim will be dismissed for failing to exhaust administrative remedies. This aggressive window can be unrealistic for traumatized workers who may be afraid to speak up about harassment or who may not recognize that the workplace harms they suffered qualified as unlawful harassment until years later. The narrow administrative filing window can be particularly detrimental for the vulnerable workers previously described, who may be concerned about retaliation and job loss.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"To prove harassment under Title VII, the plaintiffs must show that they were subject to unwelcome comments or conduct on the basis of a protected category (race, sex, religion, color, or national origin) that was so “severe or pervasive” as to alter the conditions of the plaintiffs’ employment and create a “hostile or abusive work environment.”The “severe or pervasive” language originated inMeritor, although the court did not initially define the term.In a subsequent 1993 ruling,Harris v. Forklift, the Supreme Court elaborated on the meaning of the phrase by listing several non-exhaustive factors that affect whether conduct is deemed severe or persuasive: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether is the conduct is physically threatening, humiliating, or “a mere offensive utterance”; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with work performance.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Other lower courts have misinterpreted theHarris v. Forkliftopinion to require that conduct be “severe, frequentandphysically threatening,” effectively requiring severeandpervasive conduct that is also physical in nature.InMcGraw v. Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, for example, the court held that repeated propositions, yelling, and non-consensual kissing by a supervisor was neither severe nor pervasive.Extreme lower court rulings can have a lasting effect, as courts later rely on those fact patterns and judicial interpretations to justify outcomes in favor of employers in subsequent cases.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Closely related to the “severe or pervasive” requirement is the requirement that the working environment be both “subjectively” and “objectively” hostile or abusive. This means that the plaintiff perceived the conduct as hostile or abusive, and that a “reasonable person” in that situation would have found it hostile or abusive.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Defining reasonableness has proven difficult as courts appear to lack a clear standard.In a 1998 case,Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., the Court further noted that ensuring whether or not something is objectively hostile or abusive is crucial to “ensure that courts and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace . . . for discriminatory ‘conditions of employment.’ ”Here, the Supreme Court clarified that determining severity “requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The “objective” component of the hostile or abusive standard has also proven problematic. In the summary judgment context, judges superimpose or extrapolate from their own experiences when deciding what a “reasonable person” would consider hostile and abusive.Yet, the judge’s own assumptions about tolerable behavior can be tainted by white and male privilege in ways they may not recognize. As previously discussed, the pervasive influence of hegemonic masculinity can lead judges to discount hostile aspects of the work environment simply because they are commonplace or fit within traditional workplace norms.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"For example, inOncale, Justice Scalia recounted a variety of workplace behaviors that he considered inoffensive, such as a football player being smacked on the buttocks by his coach—which very well could be experienced as hostile.However, when courts—and juries—are instructed to ignore the plaintiff’s actual (subjective) experience and focus on what a hypothesized “reasonable” (objective) other would consider harassment, it is an implicit invitation to default to a framework wherein workplace culture is largely defined by and governed by White men.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Broader representation in the judiciary may begin to address this bias. In other research, we have found that there is a significant disconnect between judges’ assessments of what is “objectively” abusive and hostile and a layperson’s assessment, which may mean that judges are disconnected from social realities and evolving social norms.However, bias does not only impact judges. Racialized and sex stereotypes can also color perceptions of witnesses, fact finders, and others, clouding their view whether the plaintiff contributed to the harassment, the extent to which they feel the plaintiff is harmed by the perpetrator, and whether enduring the conduct is deemed acceptable and within the realm of their role as worker.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As a general matter, when an employee commits a Title VII violation, the law imposes strict liability.For example, when an employee engages in sex-based discrimination or retaliates against an employee for speaking out about it, courts do not inquire whether the employer should be held vicariously liable for the conduct. Employers are simply liable for the violation. Harassment, however, is the exception. InMeritor, the Supreme Court first raised the question of whether there might be some circumstances in which employers might not be held vicariously liable for harassment.This question was settled in two 1998 cases decided together,Burlington Industries v. EllerthandFaragher v. City of Boca Raton(“Faragher/Ellerth”).In these two cases, the Supreme Court imported tort principles into the employment discrimination context. The majority opinions held that employers would only be held strictly liable for harassment committed by a supervisor when the plaintiff experienced a tangible employment action, such as a demotion, firing, or pay cut.The Court also imposed a negligence standard when coworkers were responsible for harassment. Under this rule, employers would only be held liable for harassment that they knew or should have known about, and they failed to take action to correct it.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In cases involving supervisory harassment, in which the plaintiff suffered no tangible employment action, the Court created a new affirmative defense for employers. Even when a plaintiff proves a successful harassment case—which is an uphill battle due to the constraints discussed in this section—the employer can assert an affirmative defense to evade liability. Joanna Grossman argued that the defense effectively insulates employers from liability following an initial complaint about harassment.To assert the defense, an employer must show that it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise” (the “Faragher/Ellerthdefense”).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Beyond the exceptional nature of the Court’s departure from a strict liability framework, courts have also interpreted theFaragher/Ellerthdefense in an expansive manner, favoring employers. In many cases, courts merely require employers to maintain anti-harassment and complaint policies, without inquiring into the effectiveness or reviewing the culture broadly.This trend of “judicial deference” is largely why anti-harassment policies and practices have proliferated in the workplace, many of which have been found to be ineffective at curbing harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Likewise, theFaragher/Ellerthdefense directs the blame for a hostile work environment on a plaintiff who was slow or reluctant to complain internally, rather than on the perpetrator or the employer. However, high rates of retaliation give many employees a valid reason to pause when reporting harassment or otherwise using grievance procedures.Only one in four women subjected to sex-based harassment reported it using an internal grievance procedure; even fewer filed a charge with the EEOC.At present, it is possible for a plaintiff to file a hostile work environment claim, and, despite evidence to her benefit, lose merely because she herself failed to utilize the internal grievance procedures created by the employer.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"Damage caps for compensatory and punitive damages can be particularly harmful in harassment cases when devastating psychological effects are common.Such effects can include suffering from depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideations, and adjustment disorders, among others.One study found that nurses who experience sexual harassment are three to eight times more likely to suffer from depression than women who were not harassed.These negative mental health outcomes have also been shown to have profound impact on long-term job-related outcomes, including lack of initiative, lower job satisfaction, increased propensity to leave, and financial problems.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Damage caps also limit access to justice. Because many plaintiff-side lawyers operate on contingency fees, a harassment claimant suing a small or even mid-size employer may have difficulty finding a lawyer willing to sue when the maximum recovery is less than $100 thousand. The effect of damage caps can be especially pronounced for low-wage workers, women of color, and immigrant workers engaged in domestic work or agricultural labor. When the size of recoverable wages is low due to a low base wage, plaintiffs are even more reliant on compensatory and punitive damages to attract the interest of a potential lawyer. Domestic workers, agricultural workers, and even restaurant and food-service workers may find themselves on the low end of the damage caps because they work for smaller operations. In such cases, a worker’s ability to find legal representation may ultimately depend on whether they can allege a separate tort or statutory claim not subject to the damage caps or whether they live in a state that offers more generous discrimination remedies under state law.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Damage caps also reduce deterrent effects on delinquent employers.With minimal penalties, many employers are disincentivized to improve their responses to sexual misconduct in the workplace or to change workplace culture. Once again, vulnerable workers are doubly cursed—their employers know that their workers may not be covered by the statute, and even if they are covered, they may not find an attorney or recover very much. Facing little prospect of a big-ticket lawsuit, employers in these industries can turn a blind eye to harassment with little fear of accountability.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Even prior to the #MeToo movement, the dominant narrative surrounding workplace harassment involved a subordinate White woman subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or requests for sexual favors by a high-ranking White man. This scenario, for example, commonly appeared in early harassment training from the 1980s and 1990s.It was also, to some extent, reflected in the earliest EEOC regulations, which defined harassment in terms of sexual conduct and specifically referenced “quid pro quo” harassment, in which a supervisor requests sexual favors in exchange for some workplace benefit or the avoidance of harm.",,0,html_body_unmatched

This effect is well-documented in scholarly literature. Indeed, Pat Chew and Robert Kelly’s empirical study of harassment claims concluded that judges tend to discount race-based harassment claims.Women of color pursuing litigation are further marginalized due to the courts’ pressure to separate out experiences of harassment into the false dichotomy of “Because of Race” or “Because of Sex,” when these are commonly intertwined.Empirical research has found that plaintiffs bringing intersectional claims are less than half as likely as plaintiffs bringing single claims to win their cases.Even within those statistics, Black women are more likely to lose their cases than Black men who bring intersectional claims, such as those based on both race and age.",,0,html_body_unmatched

To the extent legislation helps to address the underlying inequity—such as pay equity—the intervention may ultimately help to reduce harassment indirectly over time.We therefore sought to capture the full range of legislative interventions to enable us to evaluate them collectively. Taking a broader approach to harassment reform also allows us to identify patterns in and across legislative bills, including the extent to which the bills are: (a) individualized, offering siloed remedies for individual cases; (b) institutionalized, delegating responsibility to employer training, policy or practices; or (c) systemic, which are broader in scope and affecting many workers across industries.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Likewise, anti-discrimination law reforms were much more frequent when adding analysis of secondary topics.

We measure the effectiveness of a bill by assessing its ability to fill at least one of the many gaps identified in harassment and anti-discrimination law. The ability to fill these “holes,” to use the Swiss Cheese Model analogy, indicates an appropriate focus on how harassment and other gender inequities in the workplace are actually experienced by today’s most vulnerable workers. For example, many of the workers most vulnerable to harassment also have extremely limited economic bargaining power due to various factors including the racial and gender pay gap. To bolster these workers’ ability to fight existing wage discrimination, many state legislators added a cause of action into pay equity reform bills that would have otherwise lacked an enforcement mechanism that allowed workers to take their claims in court.",,0,html_body_unmatched

This bundle tended to reflect that new leave or pay equity laws were typically more substantive in nature and drafted with some sort of enforcement remedy beyond fines for employer violations—thereby increasing workers’ access to courts. For example, in 2016, even before the #MeToo activism, California passed an Equal Pay for Equal Work bill that was both systemic and substantive and included a bundle of enhanced protections.This new law prohibits wage discrimination, creates a cause of action for employees aggrieved by wage discrimination, and prohibits retaliation against employees seeking enforcement of the law.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Table 2 also reveals less intuitive combinations, such as bundling Anti-Discrimination Law along with other bill topics. One example of this strategy comes from New York, where the 2020 legislature introduced an extensive bill that bolstered discrimination and harassment enforcement remedies and expanded protected classes to include individuals experiencing these harms on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, marital status, familial status, and more.This strategy was also adopted in many Leave laws, which were frequently accompanied by reforms to Anti-Discrimination Law (seventy-five bills). Pay Equity was also commonly paired with reforms to Anti-Discrimination Law (forty-one bills). This bundled approach may have served as an effective strategy to effect systemic broadening of statutory protection without attracting undue attention and opposition.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Avoiding further stagnation requires legal stakeholders to offer workers consistent harassment and gender equity reform that are responsive to the changing realities of the current workplace. This includes acting swiftly to respond to the 2025 Trump administration’s attempts to reverse harassment-related protections for transgender workers under Title VII.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"State legislation partially filled gaps left by federal law. While state legislators took a broad approach to introducing harassment and gender equity reform, they took a narrower approach to amending harassment law. While we did see efforts to combat noted gaps in protection such as mandatory arbitration at both the state–and even federal level–these efforts are typically limited to banning mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims—leaving harassment on other bases, as well as other discrimination claims, unprotected. This creates challenges for the plaintiffs experiencing harassment based on multiple categories or those experiencing both discrimination and harassment, which often occur together.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"At the same time, state legislatures seriously attempted—and, in many cases, succeeded—in expanding the list of protected classes protected by anti-discrimination law. For example, some states have expanded protections to cover workers excluded from Title VII coverage, such as those working for small employers, independent contractors, and unpaid interns, among many others.Some have also expanded liability and remedies for harassment by removing Title VII’s affirmative defense against harassment as well as its caps on compensatory and punitive damages for victims of harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The most unexpected finding came from the Enforcement bill category. Enforcement was the third most introduced bill topic, suggesting stronger legislative support than expected. Moreover, when we considered secondary topics, the number of Enforcement bills nearly doubled. This suggests a strategy among state legislators to increase access to the courts and to strengthen relief available for harassment and gender equity issues, including pay equity, leave and accommodation, and anti-discrimination law. As a result, there will likely be an influx of the new plaintiffs who are able to have their day in state court. While this is generally good news, it also highlights the continuing and glaring failure of the judiciary to remedy the harassment that is experienced and brought before the courts. Expanding coverage to additional workers and increasing their access to the courts will only work if they are encountering a judiciary that is responsive to power hierarchies and realities of the workplace, while also being serious about curtailing harassment. It is clear that there is still work to be done in this respect, and we look forward to conducting further research examining the topical granularity of the Enforcement bills in our database and how future clams fare in court.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"On the federal level, several bills failed in their attempt to remedy the judicially created harassment doctrine outlined in Part II. House Bill 8698, for example, introduced in October 2020, sought to amend Title VII to overturn Supreme Court jurisprudence that is unfavorable to victims of harassment, includingAlexander v. Sandoval,Vance v. Ball State,andFaragher/Ellerth.This bill would enhance enforcement by allowing the plaintiffs to sue under Title VII based on evidence of disparate impact, strengthening the plaintiff’s ability to sue under a theory of vicarious liability, and reducing the likelihood of judicial deference to employer anti-harassment policies and procedures, despite ineffectiveness.The bill also created a broader exception to the Federal Arbitration Act for all employment-related rights and remedies under federal and state law, not just sexual harassment.It would also have expanded available remedies by allowing the plaintiffs to collect pre-trial attorney’s fees.House Bill 8698 would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,a proposal that was ultimately rendered moot by the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision inBostock v. Clayton.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Knowing the effect of the #MeToo movement on legislative agendas and bill passage rates is important for those who wish to maintain and expand the momentum that was fueled and, in some cases, created by these movements. More specifically, legislators and other legal decisionmakers, including the courts and government agencies, should make workers’ voices central to their work. Following the lead of worker organizers whose anti-harassment advocacy efforts predated the groundswell of attention brought by the #MeToo movement will not only bring consistency, but also timeliness and specificity to the anti-harassment agendas set by various legal stakeholders. Below, we outline four specific issues that we believe should be central to advocacy efforts in particular, due to their deleterious effects on workers most vulnerable to workplace harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"While the past five years following the #MeToo movement have seen reforms that were more systemic and bipartisan than anticipated, major gaps persist, allowing harassment to remain a threat. Harassment and gender equity reform is particularly in need of (1) more systemic changes with greater oversight, transparency, and accountability, (2) greater focus on intersectional harms, (3) well-informed enforcement efforts by judges, attorneys, and agencies alike, and (4) more creative strategies to deal with retaliation.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Importantly, this requires moving away from the narrow interpretation of sexual harassment by judicial precedent and envisioning a new legal agenda around gender equity reform that is responsive to the reality of our evolving workplace and society. Doing so will require not only our policymakers, but also agencies and courts, to internalize gender inequity—rather than sexual desire—as the foundation of workplace harassment, highlight how it is exacerbated by low-wage employment, and acknowledge how its impact, in many cases, compounds for women with additional protected characteristics, in precarious work, segregated working conditions, and occupationally isolating jobs.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"As aforementioned, our legislative analysis suggests that plaintiffs will have greater access to the courts in the near future; however, we must further question and examine what that means if the judiciary continues to constrain harassment law and gender equity doctrine. This is a key moment for employment and civil rights lawyers to advocate effectively for their clients and in doing so, set new precedents, for the court. Doctrinal areas in need of innovation include the “severe and pervasive” requirement, the “objectively” hostile or abusive standard, and theFaragher/Ellerthaffirmative defense.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Strengthening judicial enforcement is also important in the context of retaliation, which continues to go hand in hand with harassment. Despite high rates of retaliation and its role in deterring victims from speaking up and using existing protections, state legislative agendas failed to pass measures that would more effectively deal with this issue. Solving the problem of retaliation requires more than changes to anti-retaliation laws; it also requires stronger enforcement that would incentivize systemic changes to workplace culture. In addition to legislation strengthening anti-retaliation protections generally, more bills should focus on identifying and mandating what specific behaviors are considered retaliatory. These reforms could include retaliatory actions such as substantive changes to terms of employment, disclosing personnel files, contacting immigration authorities, or threatening to report an employee’s immigration status.Doing so would signal the legislature’s recognition that retaliation is rooted in systemic power imbalances and is particularly threatening for workers in low-wage industries or workers with intersectional identities including race and national origin.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Considerable legislative progress has been made in the first five years after #MeToo went viral. Overall, more harassment and gender equity reform has occurred than expected, and through a more varied and comprehensive approach than first predicted. This is particularly true at the state level where new laws also offer greater coverage and enforcement remedies under civil rights statutes regardless of worker classification and with consideration for their occupational hazards and intersectional vulnerabilities.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"While it is clear that the #MeToo movement moved the law forward with respect to harassment and gender equity, more work needs to be done, particularly with respect to centering the interests of workers most vulnerable to harassment. Various institutions–including judges, lawmakers, and agencies–contributed to the dissonance between the legal enforcement of, and the realized experience of, workplace harassment. This dissonance is then distributed widely via media, leading to public apathy and confusion about the current landscape of workplace harassment and related gender equity issues. These legal stakeholders thus have a responsibility to ensure that access to justice is equitably and consistently distributed to all workers, especially those most vulnerable. Fulfilling this responsibility grows more",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This does not mean, however, that effective and responsive reform efforts are out of reach. Legislators and regulators alike should consult anti-harassment worker organizers in crafting future reform. Doing so will enable legal branches to establish greater consistency in their treatment of harassment and remain more up to date with the rapidly changing realities of workplace harassment. This, in turn, will have the desired effect of closing the gaps between how harassment is enforced on the books, how it is enforced in the workplace, and how it is experienced by working women.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Federal actors should also make fruitful use of state-level innovation to ensure that state-level successes achieve a broader impact. Now that states have provided evidence of bipartisan support for these issues, Congress and federal agencies including the EEOC, the Department of Health and Human Services, and even the Occupation Safety and Health Administration, should step in and offer a more systemic approach that covers the multitude of gender equity issues that contribute to harassment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Lastly, our goal is for our dataset to be used as a public resource, from which further research can be developed with the hope of providing concrete findings regarding the effectiveness of state-specific harassment and gender equity legislation. In turn, this research can be used to bolster the advocacy efforts by worker organizers. Doing so will enable legal stakeholders to remain in conversation with those best situated to determine the needs of a given workplace with respect to preventing harassment: the workers themselves.",,0,html_body_unmatched
