1,RESPECTING LISTENERS' AUTONOMY: THE RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE,section_header,body_text,"That said, however, once one recognizes that speakers have no First Amendment right, free of government regulation, to foist themselves upon unwilling listeners—and indeed, that listenersdohave legitimate interests in avoiding undesired speakers or content—it seems clear that the government has a legitimate role to act as facilitator, assisting listeners to invoke their “right” to be left alone—or perhaps better put, their desire not to engage in a communicative relationship with a particular speaker. For that reason, there should be no constitutional problem with the state creating mechanisms that enable listeners to communicate to speakers that they desire to be left alone. There should also be no First Amendment barrier, assuming the listener(s) do invoke their First Amendment interest in being left alone, to the government penalizing a speaker who nonetheless persists in pursuing their unwilling victims. In that situation, the speaker has no First Amendment rights at stake, so a penalty is perfectly constitutional.",,81.03448275862068,matched

1,INTRODUCTION,section_header,body_text,"It should be noted, though, that in practice, a right not to listen as against the state, while it must be real and robust in certain spheres—notably public discourse—has significant limits. The government in fact forces us to listen to messages of its choosing all the time as a condition of engaging in certain activities—often while also compelling the relevant speech. Every time one gets on a plane, one is forced to listen to a federally mandated safety announcement (and airlines are required to communicate them). Employees are forced to suffer through state-mandated trainings, such as sexual harassment trainings, all the time (and employers are required to provide them). My own employer, the University of California—a state entity—is particularly training-happy. Safety instructions are required for employees in many hazardous industries—and so on ad infinitum. But within the core First Amendment domains such as public discourse and artistic/literary expression, a very strong right not to listen—which can be offset only by the weightiest state interests—must exist. The only reason it has not been recognized, it would seem, is that governments appear to assume the existence of such a core right and so stay clear of it.",,83.33333333333334,matched

The right to choose an audience is implicit in the Court's standard test to evaluate content-neutral 'time, place, or manner' regulations, which requires inter alia that any regulation 'leave open ample alternative channels of  communication.' 4 If such 'ample alternative channels' referred to the ability to speak to any audience, the test would have no teeth at all-and that is not the case, as illustrated by numerous cases. 5 Furthermore, in the leading case dealing with expressive conduct, a topic closely related to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the second Justice Harlan also went out of his way to state that he would not uphold a regulation of conduct with an 'incidental' impact on expression if the law 'in practice has the effect of entirely preventing a 'speaker' from reaching a significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate.' 6",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

But by failing to seriously analyze both listeners’andspeakers’ interests and incentives in assessing free speech issues, theRed LionCourt created a conundrum. The Fairness Doctrine may have, in theory, advanced broadcast audiences’ interest in receiving balanced coverage of public issues, but it also incentivized broadcasters to avoid taking strong editorial positions on public issues other than anodyne centrist ones. Moreover, it disincentivized coverage of public issues in favor of generic entertainment, in order to avoid the strictures of the Fairness Doctrine.But faced with this argument, the Court simply (and rather naively) deferred to the FCC’s views that the “possibility [of any such incentive effect] is at best speculative.”Yet less than two decades later the FCC itself, in the course of repealing the Fairness Doctrine, concluded that the doctrine did in fact create substantial “chilling effects” because “the fairness doctrine provides broadcasters with a powerful incentive not to air controversial issue programming.”Of course if this was true—as is likely—then without speakers, listeners during the Fairness Doctrine era were necessarily left (so to speak) in the dark regarding public policy controversies.

Unlike in Virginia Pharmacy ,  there is little  doubt  that Red Lion involved  willing  speakers-in  the  shape  of  the broadcasters themselves (the plaintiff in the case was, in fact, a broadcaster 26 )-who would communicate to listeners/viewers. But by failing to seriously analyze both listeners' and speakers' interests and incentives in assessing free speech issues, the Red Lion Court created a conundrum. The Fairness  Doctrine  may  have,  in  theory,  advanced  broadcast  audiences' interest  in  receiving  balanced  coverage  of  public  issues,  but  it  also incentivized broadcasters to avoid taking strong editorial positions on public issues  other  than  anodyne  centrist  ones.  Moreover,  it  disincentivized coverage of public issues in favor of generic entertainment, in order to avoid the strictures of the Fairness Doctrine. 27 But faced with this argument, the Court  simply  (and  rather  naively)  deferred  to  the  FCC's  views  that  the 'possibility [of any such incentive effect] is at best speculative.' 28 Yet less than two decades later the FCC itself, in the course of repealing the Fairness Doctrine, concluded that the doctrine did in fact create substantial 'chilling effects' because 'the fairness doctrine provides broadcasters with a powerful incentive not to air controversial issue programming.' 29 Of course if this was true-as  is  likely-then  without  speakers,  listeners  during  the  Fairness Doctrine era were necessarily left (so to speak) in the dark regarding public policy controversies.

'alte[rs] the content of [their] speech.'

The answer, I would posit, lies in the much-neglected interaction between speakers' and listeners' rights. In particular,  recognizing  a  right  not  to  listen  raises  the  problem  of  how  to reconcile  a  speaker's  interest  in  reaching  a  particular  audience,  with  a listener's interest in not being part of that audience. Moreover, the leading scholarly  discussion  of  a  putative  right  not  to  listen  similarly  adopts  a unilateral rather than a relational approach. 66 In that article, Caroline Mala Corbin makes a compelling case, based both on the autonomy interests of listeners, 67 and  on  more  instrumental  concerns  about  democratic  selfgovernance, 68 for a First Amendment right not to listen, and I am happy in this article to accept and build upon that analysis.

Most  importantly, recognizing the relational nature of freedom of speech strongly suggests that there is little to no social value associated with speakers who address specific listeners against their will. But even here, an important distinction must be made. When unpopular or even deeply offensive ideas are expounded as a part of what I will call 'one-to-many' speech, which is to say speech that is available to the public or significant portions of it, 69 speakers' rights must normally prevail over listeners' rights. 70 The reason is that in that situation, permitting  listeners  to  prevail  would  scrub  public  discourse  of  unpopular ideas, a result which is anathema to the First Amendment.

19,"Needless to say, however, for reasons already discussed, any mechanism designed to protect listeners' desires to be left alone cannot be invoked in one-to-many speech situations, in which there are other, willing listeners in the broader audience who would be deprived of their access to speech. In this situation, 'freedom of speech' does exist, and so silencing the speaker  will  violate both the  speaker's  and  the  willing  listeners'  First Amendment rights. And because the First Amendment presumptively favors speech over silence, it clearly cannot permit letting some unwilling listeners' rights to trump two other sets of rights. 76 Note that with respect to speech occurring in open public dialogue, such as public protests or speech in the media (including social media platforms), there will essentially always be some willing listeners in the audience, and so recognizing a right to be left alone  would  never  result  in  suppressing  such  speech.  In  other  words, recognizing a constitutionally based interest in being left alone has little or no implications for broad, public debate.

City  of Struthers , the Court struck down a city ordinance banning the door-to-door distribution of literature, primarily on the grounds that the city could have achieved its goal of protecting tranquility in the home with narrower means such as a model ordinance that 'would make it an offense for any person to ring  the  bell  of  a  householder  who  has  appropriately  indicated  that  he  is unwilling to be disturbed.' 78 This approach was preferable, the Court said, because  such  a  law  'leaves  the  decision  as  to  whether  distributors  of literature may  lawfully  call at  a  home  where  it  belongs-with  the homeowner himself,' 79 which  in  the  language  of  this  essay  means  in  the hands of the unwilling listener.

But given the above analysis, there is no good reason to limit the principle established in these cases to the home. Moreover, it is not hard to imagine a law stating that when an individual is addressing another and the listener uses unambiguous language indicating an intent to be left alone, such as 'please stop talking to me,' 'I don't want to  hear  this,'  or  'leave  me  alone,'  the  speaker  then  will  have  a  legally enforceable obligation to stop speaking to that individual (but not to others, so in one-to-many situations this law would have no impact).",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

Further, the period after which  invocation  by  unwilling  listeners  expires  may  well  vary  with circumstances-and again,  any  statute  addressing  this  issue  must  specify that. And in this respect, homes are arguably special. No Solicitation signs outside  one's  home  constitute  essentially  permanent  invocations-though signs can of course be taken down-as did the request to stop mail upheld in Rowan , though of course that too could be revoked. In some settings such as online interactions, one can imagine invocations lasting for weeks or months.

Because “above all else, the First Amendment means that the government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,”it is clear that the government may notitselfdecide, purportedly on behalf of unwilling listeners, that speech of a specific content or viewpoint will be unwelcome. That role lies solely with the listeners themselves, and for the government to take on the role of proxy censor could very easily become a vehicle for censoring speech the government itself disfavors. Indeed, even when empirically it seems very likely that a targeted audience will not want to be exposed to particular speech—for example, anti-abortion speech directed at abortion clinic patients, or anti-military protests directed at attendees at a military funeral—it remains true that the government’s role cannot be to silence the speech on the assumption that it will be unwelcome.

The right to choose an audience is implicit in the Court’s standard test to evaluate content-neutral “time, place, or manner” regulations, which requires inter alia that any regulation “leave open ample alternative channels of communication.”If such “ample alternative channels” referred to the ability to speak toanyaudience, the test would have no teeth at all—and that is not the case, as illustrated by numerous cases.Furthermore, in the leading case dealing with expressive conduct, a topic closely related to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the second Justice Harlan also went out of his way to state that he would not uphold a regulation of conduct with an “incidental” impact on expression if the law “in practice has the effect of entirely preventing a ‘speaker’ from reaching a significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

A second scenario is when neither speaker nor listener is willing or desirous of communicating. In that situation, state interference would be fairly bizarre, except under specific regulatory circumstances, such as safety videos on airlines or workplace trainings, both situations in which neither the speaker nor listener has a choice not to participate.

Pacifica Foundation, the Court justified a restriction on daytime broadcasts of “indecent” materials in part on the theory, citingRowan, that broadcasting invades the home.And perhaps most famously, inFrisby v. Schultz, the Court upheld a municipal prohibition on targeted, residential picketing on the basis of the state’s strong interest (citing bothRowanandPacifica Foundation) in shielding individuals from unwanted speech in their homes.However, all of those cases involvethe home, where special privacy considerations (quite aside from the First Amendment) obviously exist. Outside of the home,Lehmanremains the only significant precedent applying concepts of “captive audiences,” and truth be told under the modern (post-1974) public forum doctrine, concepts of captive audiences are likely unnecessary to uphold the City of Shaker Heights’s subject-matter-based, but viewpoint-neutral, restriction on speech in a nonpublic or limited public forum.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The answer, I would posit, lies in the much-neglected interaction between speakers’ and listeners’ rights. In particular, recognizing a right not to listen raises the problem of how to reconcile a speaker’s interest in reaching a particular audience, with a listener’s interest in not being part of that audience. Moreover, the leading scholarly discussion of a putative right not to listen similarly adopts a unilateral rather than a relational approach.In that article, Caroline Mala Corbin makes a compelling case, based both on the autonomy interests of listeners,and on more instrumental concerns about democratic self-governance,for a First Amendment right not to listen, and I am happy in this article to accept and build upon that analysis. But she does not address the implications of such a right for the corresponding rights of speakers, or the relationship between what she treats as independent rights of speakers and listeners. We will therefore turn to that issue next.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In seeking to reconcile speakers’ and listeners’ rights when they potentially conflict, it is absolutely essential to recognize the deeply interrelated nature of those rights—something the Court has failed to do. As discussed earlier, speakers and listeners are just two sides of the same expressive coin; indeed, it might be said that there are not two rights at issue here, but rather one joint right to engage in/receive expression. But as in so many other situations, when joint rights holders—or for that matter, joint property owners—disagree, resolving such conflicts is extremely difficult.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Nonetheless, recognizing the joint roles of speakers and listeners in expression does lead to some important insights. Most importantly, recognizing the relational nature of freedom of speech strongly suggests that there is little to no social value associated with speakers who address specific listeners against their will. But even here, an important distinction must be made. When unpopular or even deeply offensive ideas are expounded as a part of what I will call “one-to-many” speech, which is to say speech that is available to the public or significant portions of it,speakers’ rights must normally prevail over listeners’ rights.The reason is that in that situation, permitting listeners to prevail would scrub public discourse of unpopular ideas, a result which is anathema to the First Amendment. Put differently, permitting individual listeners to invoke a right not to listen to shut down one-to-many speech would amount to an impermissible heckler’s veto.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The analysis is very different, however, when dealing with one-to-one or one-to-a few speech. When speakers address unwilling, individual listeners who have expressed their desire not to be spoken to, the primary goal of continued speech is often no longer to convince or to add to the putative “marketplace of ideas.” It is rather to inflict harm on the listener/victim. As such, it has no legitimate claim to First Amendment protection in light of the greatly diminished speaker interests and very strong listener interest in not listening. It is this principle that led the Court to uphold a ban on targeted, residential picketing inFrisby v. Schultz, while clarifying that a ban on non-targeted residential picketing would almost certainly be invalid.The Court seemed to be assuming, reasonably in my view, that targeted picketing was overwhelmingly likely to be one-to-one speech, while nontargeted picketing was one-to-many. Its error was to assume inFrisbyand other captive audience cases that a listener’s interest in avoiding one-to-one speech is limited to the home.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The very idea that speakers have some sort of First Amendment right to thrust their speech on unwilling listeners is based on a rigid, “individual rights” based approach to First Amendment analysis, which does not sufficiently account for complexity. Once one recognizes the interpersonal and associational nature of communications as a joint enterprise between speaker and audience, it should be obvious that no speaker has a “right” to thrust their views on unwilling audience members any more than an individual has a right to insist on joining a First Amendment association in which they are not welcome.To posit such a right—as the Supreme Court appears to in cases likeCohenandSnyder—is to posit a personal right on the part of individuals to try to persuade or convert other individuals to the speakers’ beliefsagainst their will, not as a part of public debate and discourse, but as a part of a personal conversation.",,0,html_body_unmatched

And it must be remembered that the First Amendment only protects speakers from censorship or silencing by thestate, not from censorship by other private individuals.Recognizing this seemingly mundane point, however, points a way towards how we might reconcile a posited right to be left alone with a speaker’s right to their chosen audience, all the while bearing in mind important First Amendment limits on state power.",,0,html_body_unmatched

,,,,"Needless to say, however, for reasons already discussed, any mechanism designed to protect listeners’ desires to be left alone cannot be invoked in one-to-many speech situations, in which there are other, willing listeners in the broader audience who would be deprived of their access to speech. In this situation, “freedom of speech” does exist, and so silencing the speaker will violateboththe speaker’s and the willing listeners’ First Amendment rights. And because the First Amendment presumptively favors speech over silence, it clearly cannot permit letting some unwilling listeners’ rights to trump two other sets of rights.Note that with respect to speech occurring in open public dialogue, such as public protests or speech in the media (including social media platforms), there will essentially always besomewilling listeners in the audience, and so recognizing a right to be left alone would never result in suppressing such speech. In other words, recognizing a constitutionally based interest in being left alone has little or no implications for broad, public debate. Importantly, this ensures that all individuals, even the most irascible, will regularly be exposed to viewpoints they reject, and so will have the opportunity to change their minds.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Note that under this view,Snyder v. Phelpswas correctly decided. The speech in that case, a public protest by the Westboro Church was a form of one-to-many speech, not speech directed solely or mainly at the victim. Indeed, as noted earlier, the plaintiff in that case, the grieving father, did not even see the signs at the time of the protest.In that situation, it was impermissible for the state to silence the speakers in order to protect Snyder’s desire to be left alone, because the result would be to silence protected speech as to other listeners. ThePacifica FoundationCourt, however, was wrong to uphold the FCC’s restrictions on indecent broadcasting, at least insofar as it relied on the existence of unwilling listeners, because radio broadcasts are a classic form of one-to-many speech (whether protecting children might separately support the rule is a different matter).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Therefore, a right of listeners to be left alone should not impact public debate or cleanse it of unpopular or offensive ideas. In the context of privately communicated speech, however, the implications of the above analysis are significant.

It also means that in a myriad of other situations in which the Court has suggested that the burden must be on listeners to avert their eyes, move on to another place, or simply suffer, the state has a legitimate role to play in reducing that burden so long as it does not impact public debate.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Developing a specific legislative proposal for how state or federal laws might assist unwilling listeners in protecting their desire to be left alone is beyond the scope of this paper. It should be noted, however, that some such mechanisms already exist and have been endorsed by the courts—though they all, unsurprisingly, involve the home. Thus inMartin v. City of Struthers, the Court struck down a city ordinance banning the door-to-door distribution of literature, primarily on the grounds that the city could have achieved its goal of protecting tranquility in the home with narrower means such as a model ordinance that “would make it an offense for any person to ring the bell of a householder who has appropriately indicated that he is unwilling to be disturbed.”This approach was preferable, the Court said, because such a law “leaves the decision as to whether distributors of literature may lawfully call at a home where it belongs—with the homeowner himself,”which in the language of this essay means in the hands of the unwilling listener. The Court’s decision inWatchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. v. Village of Stratton, recognizing a home “resident’s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation with unwelcome visitors,”is to similar effect. The ordinance upheld inRowanpermitting mail recipients to refuse to receive additional mail from unwanted mailers is as well.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"It is true, of course, that it is much easier to put up an outdoor “No Solicitation” sign at one’s home—the remedy endorsed inMartinandWatchtower Bible—than in public places. But given the above analysis, there is no good reason to limit the principle established in these cases to the home. Moreover, it is not hard to imagine a law stating that when an individual is addressing another and the listener uses unambiguous language indicating an intent to be left alone, such as “please stop talking to me,” “I don’t want to hear this,” or “leave me alone,” the speaker then will have a legally enforceable obligation to stop speaking tothat individual(but not to others, so in one-to-many situations this law would have no impact).",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Some clarifications are necessary, however. First, at least outside of the home, invoking the right to be left alone cannot be indefinite—any statute protecting that right must specify a time period after which the invocation expires and has to be re-invoked.That caveat, like the continuing protection for one-to-many speech, leaves open the possibility that unwilling listeners can and will sometimes change their minds. Further, the period after which invocation by unwilling listeners expires may well vary with circumstances—and again, any statute addressing this issue must specify that. And in this respect, homesarearguably special. No Solicitation signs outside one’s home constitute essentially permanent invocations—though signs can of course be taken down—as did the request to stop mail upheld inRowan, though of course that too could be revoked. In some settings such as online interactions, one can imagine invocations lasting for weeks or months. But in personal interactions, it might well be reasonable to require reinvocations every hour or two. Details such as these are for legislatures to work out, the results of which should be due a good deal of deference from courts.",,0,html_body_unmatched

But by analyzing the case as it did, the Court has created a serious risk that moving forward, lower courts will treat harassment and stalking issues as co-extensive with the threats doctrine, thereby ignoring the implications ofRowanand the right to be left alone.If the Courthadanalyzed the case properly, it would have recognized that because Counterman’s speech was unwanted, and because his victim had invoked her right to be left alone, as she did in that case by repeatedly blocking Counterman on social media,the existence of a threat was irrelevant. Counterman’s expression was a classic case of repeated infliction of unwanted speech in a one-to-one context, and so there should have been no barrier to his prosecution under a properly drafted statute—though it is unclear whether the actual Colorado statute in that case satisfied those standards.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Consider also harassment litigation arising out of campus protests regarding the Gaza war,or complaints by members of Congress that by failing to control such protests campuses permitted harassment of Jewish students.Insofar as these harassment claims are rooted in one-to-one speech, such as following students around and yelling slurs or otherwise directing hostile speech at individual students who have demanded to be left alone, the First Amendment under the above analysis provides no protection to such speech. (Whether universities have a legal obligation to protect victims from such speech is, of course, a different matter.) On the other hand, to the extent that claims of harassment are rooted in slogans yelled during protests such as “From the River to the Sea,” which many people consider antisemitic, or the allegedly antisemitic content of signs, this is classic one-to-many speech which cannot be condemned purely because of its unwanted nature; indeed, at least with respect to public universities silencing such speech, it would almost certainly constitute viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. The same would be true even regarding calls for genocide that Republican members of Congress such as Elise Stefanik complained about,since such calls surely would not qualify as unprotected incitement under the stringent test ofBrandenburg v. Ohio.After all, for better or for worse, there is no “awful speech” exception to the First Amendment.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Another area in which conflicts between speakers and listeners regularly arise is in the context of protests and other expression near health care facilities that provide abortion services. The difficulty arises because on the one hand, the speech of protestors and others—whether proor con-abortion rights—is obviously speech on important, controversial, and politically charged topics, and so receives the highest level of First Amendment protection. But on the other hand, it seems reasonable to assume that most members of the audience for this speech—who are overwhelmingly employees or patients of the relevant clinics—would prefer not to hear the speech, sometimes strenuously so. Therefore, courts and legislatures struggle with how to address these conflicts.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Justice Scalia’s dissent took sharp issue with this reasoning. He argued that because the Colorado statute was based on the assumption that only speech within the statutory prohibition—“protest, counseling, and education”—was likely to be unwelcome, the law was content-based and so invalid.At least as to this point, it should be noted, Justice Scalia’s argument is entirely consistent with my analysis set forth above (and concomitantly, the majority’s is not). The State may not decide for itself what speech is unwelcome, and insofar as Colorado did so, its law was invalid.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But Justice Scalia did not stop at this point. He went on to argue thatanylaw targeting unwanted communications was automatically content-based, because the law was triggered by the communicative impact of the unwelcome communication. As such, he would have invalidated any such law.Butthatgoes a step too far, insofar as it suggests that speakers have a right to impose their speech on others when their audience has actively asserted a desire not to listen. In a later abortion case (discussed next), Justice Scalia suggested that his argument that the government had no legitimate interest in protecting people from unwanted speech was limited to restrictions on speech “in the public streets and sidewalks.”But again, Justice Scalia is off the mark. The key question is notwherethe speech occurs, but whether the speech is directed solely at unwilling listeners, as opposed to a broader audience (in other words, one-to-one versus one-to-many). Certainly, in many instances, includingSnyder, it is reasonable to assume that speech in public places is directed at thepublic. But that assumption does not hold in the context of all anti-abortion protests, in which the speech is sometimes directed solely and directly at often-unwilling employees and patients. InSnyder, the Westboro Baptist Church sought out a broader audience for their protest by contacting the press and drawing attention to themselves; it is therefore doubtful if the protest would have proceeded if no one aside from funeral attendees had shown up (remember that the plaintiff inSnyderdid not even see the speech at the time of the protest). But the same is very much not true of anti-abortion protests, which regularly occur without any broader public presence, and which are sometimes, though certainly not always, designed and intended to cause emotional harm to their “audience.”",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"Now consider the Court’s most recent, significant decision in this area,McCullen v. Coakley.There, the Court unanimously invalidated a thirty-five foot “buffer zone” that Massachusetts mandated around the entrances of abortion clinics, in which no one was allowed to enter or remain in, except for specific purposes such as simply walking through, people on clinic business, and law enforcement and other public functions.The Court, however, divided sharply on its reasoning. A five-Justice majority (with Chief Justice Roberts writing) found the law content-neutral but nonetheless concluded that it failed intermediate scrutiny.The concurring Justices (led again by Justice Scalia) would have invalidated the law as a content-based restriction on speech.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In short, the bottom line is that insofar as the Colorado and Massachusetts laws inHillandMcCullenwere based on thestate’sassumption that anti-abortion speech is unwelcome, the Court was wrong to uphold the Colorado law and correct to invalidate the Massachusetts one. And the Justices are, to reiterate, also clearly correct that speech cannot be expunged from public debate simply because it might offend or discomfit some who hear it. But by going further and suggesting, as Justice Scalia did inHilland all the Justices did inMcCullen, that the state has no interest in enforcinglisteners’ expressed preferences to be left alone, they are just wrong. The question of how a state might design a mechanism to enforce those expressed preferences has already been discussed; but for the purposes of this discussion the key point is that the Court appears in these cases to be conflating two entirely separate questions: the exclusion of offensive speech from public debate, which is impermissible, and the enforcement of listeners’ expressly invoked right to be left alone, which is not.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The majority’s reasoning inNetChoicewas clearly correct as a First Amendment matterand is more than sufficient to sustain properly framed challenges to the Texas, and, truth be told, Florida, laws. But a focus on listener interests suggests that there is something more fundamentally problematic about Florida’s and Texas’s approaches to regulating platforms. The laws of both states are rooted in the basic assumption that legislators (and Governors) know best what content listeners/users should and should not be exposed to. But that assumption and approach are antithetical to First Amendment principles. It is for individuals, not the state, to decide what expressive interactions they wish to participate in.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"A much better approach would be one proposed by a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by Francis Fukuyama, which seeks to introduce competition and choice in “middleware,” meaning the software that that performs editorial and content moderation functions on platforms.Requiring platforms to permit users to pick their middleware of choice from a competitive menu of options empowersusers/listenersto choose what speech to consume, and what not to consume, and so such a law would advance listeners’ rights. Of course, such a legal requirement would still burden platforms’ editorial rights, but in a less blatantly biased (and political) manner than Florida and Texas sought to do and somightbe constitutionally defensible.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"But the EU’s approach is misguided. It assumes that targeted advertising directed at children is inherently harmful or invasive. But, in fact, for vulnerable groups such as LGBTQ youth, shielding them from targeted content can cause substantial harm.And more fundamentally, it is always better for the state to empower listeners, even minor listeners—who after all enjoy significant First Amendment rights to access information—than to make choices for them as the DSA does. For that reason, if the United States or an individual state felt it necessary to restrict targeted advertising directed at minors, it would be much better to empower minors or their parents to opt out of all, or specific forms of, targeted advertising than to enact a flat ban as the DSA does. Admittedly, authorizing parents to restrict targeted advertising could also have deleterious effects on vulnerable youth (sometimes parents are the problem); but that is a difficulty that pervades our society and can only be addressed through broader legal reforms, particularly in family law.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"This is not to say that protecting the right not to listen, and the right to be left alone, do not raise concerns. For one thing, it will reduce the occasions in which individuals will be exposed to ideas they do not like, which might be to the detriment of the quality of public discourse.Furthermore, a right to be left alone that must be invoked to be effective might well be less useful to the disempowered in our society, who might therefore be harmed if the government is prevented from taking the initiative in shielding them from harmful speech.But all rights come with a cost; and on balance, this paper argues that recognizing and empowering listener autonomy is worth the cost.",,0,html_body_unmatched
