1,THE DEFAULT RULE AND DUE PROCESS: DIVERGING INTERPRETATIONS OF 'THE CHARGING DOCUMENT' REQUIREMENT IN EXTRADITION TREATIES,section_header,body_text,"As the two circuit court opinions in 2023 demonstrate, the default rule of treaty interpretation continues to influence the judiciary’s role in determining whether to certify a foreign nation’s extradition request. In the Ninth Circuit opinion inManrique v. Kolc, the court was partial to the Secretary of State’s interpretation of “the charging document” requirement in its extradition of Toledo—the court found the “charging document” requirement to be relatively inconsequential in finding that the Peruvian government had satisfied its extradition request by providing anAcusación Fiscal. However, inVitkus v. Blinken, the court was more dubious of the Secretary of State’s interpretation of the treaty and disagreed that the documents that the Lithuanian government had provided to extradite Vitkus satisfied the requirements listed in the U.S.-Lithuania Extradition Treaty.",,71.31147540983606,matched

In  that  same  vein,  the  recognition  and enforcement of international human rights law has grown in the last century, and as rules of international human rights law have become binding on the United States judiciary, courts are faced with new, conflicting demands of both extradition requests and international law-derived rights of relators (that is, the individuals whose extradition is requested by foreign countries).",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

As  the  fundamental  right  to  due  process  has  been  developed  by international human rights bodies over the course of the 20th century, the judiciary's deference to the executive branch has come into conflict with the advancement of due process as an international human right as well. 11",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

22,II.  INTERPRETING THE 'CHARGING DOCUMENT',section_header,body_text,"The discrepancy between these two circuit courts illustrates how the judiciary’s deference to the executive branch (a deference codified by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century and referred to in this Note as the “default rule”) in matters of extradition treaty interpretation has manifested in the 2020s. At least twenty-eight extradition treaties that the United States has entered into with foreign nations reference the “charging document” in their lists of documents that a foreign nation is required to provide in an extradition request to the United States.As the judiciary will likely be called to interpret the “charging document” in future extradition requests, the judiciary’s decision to give deference to the executive branch in interpreting this phrase merits attention. The interpretation of the “charging document” requirement implicates due process concerns of relators, given that the charging document requirement ensures that the country requesting extradition complies with the procedure outlined in its treaty. This Note argues that courts, when faced with extradition requests from countries whose treaties include the “charging document” requirement, are bound by precedent to apply the default rule in a way that may conflict with a relator’s constitutional, due process rights. This Note also contends that this form of deferential interpretation to the executive branch may conflict with the fundamental right of due process afforded to relators by international law. However, departing from executive deference affects the United States’ foreign relations with other sovereign countries—this Note will briefly explore this ramification as well.",,85.0,matched

22,"In 2023, the Ninth and Fourth Circuits were charged with interpreting the phrase 'the charging document' in two bilateral extradition treaties: the Ninth Circuit analyzed a bilateral extradition treaty between the U.S. and Peru, and the Fourth Circuit analyzed a bilateral extradition treaty between the U.S. and Lithuania. 110 These cases, Vitkus v.

Both cases rose to the federal circuit courts  after  the  foreign  nationals  petitioned  for  stays  and  preliminary injunctions on their extradition requests.

The court found that the addition of 'the charging document' was not necessary to find that Peru satisfied the requirements of the extradition treaty, finding support in Emami v. United States District Court for the Northern District and In re Assarsson . In both Emami and Assarsson ,  there  was  no  'formal  charge'  listed  in  the  U.S.Sweden and U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany treaties to find that a relator might be extraditable, and as such, the requirement that there be 'formal charges'  in  the  foreign  jurisdiction  before  the  foreign  country  filed  an extradition request was not a necessary requirement to find that the relators were extraditable. 128 The court utilized these cases even though neither case dealt with a 'charging document' requirement. In Toledo's case, the court found that 'the Treaty does not mention formal charges or the Orden de Enjuiciamiento anywhere. And the requirement of a 'copy of the charging document'-which specifies no particular document-does not define the level  of  formality  [they]  should  read  into  'charged  with.' ' 129 The  court found that such a reading would allow the Acusación Fiscal to be permitted as a 'charging document' given that language elsewhere in the U.S.-Peru treaty  equated  'charged  with'  to  'sought  for  prosecution,'  and  that  the documents  indicating  an  individual  was  'sought  for  prosecution'  could encompass  documents  submitted  before  the Orden  de  Enjuiciamiento in Peruvian  criminal  proceedings-that  is,  the Acusación  Fiscal -therefore satisfying the treaty's requirements. 130",text,footnote,,Id.,100.0,matched

In doing so, the court found that Peru had provided the necessary documents to satisfy the “charging document” requirement. On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit found that the phrase was clear and unambiguous, holding inVitkus v. Blinkenthat the judiciary was compelled to decline Lithuania’s extradition request upon analyzing the “charging document” requirement in the U.S.-Lithuania Extradition Treaty.

At least twenty-eight extradition treaties that the United States has entered into with foreign nations reference the “charging document” in their lists of documents that a foreign nation is required to provide in an extradition request to the United States.As the judiciary will likely be called to interpret the “charging document” in future extradition requests, the judiciary’s decision to give deference to the executive branch in interpreting this phrase merits attention. The interpretation of the “charging document” requirement implicates due process concerns of relators, given that the charging document requirement ensures that the country requesting extradition complies with the procedure outlined in its treaty. This Note argues that courts, when faced with extradition requests from countries whose treaties include the “charging document” requirement, are bound by precedent to apply the default rule in a way that may conflict with a relator’s constitutional, due process rights. This Note also contends that this form of deferential interpretation to the executive branch may conflict with the fundamental right of due process afforded to relators by international law. However, departing from executive deference affects the United States’ foreign relations with other sovereign countries—this Note will briefly explore this ramification as well.",,78.4090909090909,matched

In brief, the statute governing extraditions in the United States bestows the judiciary with the responsibility of certifying an individual for extradition: the judiciary interprets the relevant extradition treaty to determine whether the person being sought by the requesting country may be certified as extraditable.Once the court certifies the extraditability of a relator, the Secretary of State has the discretion to either extradite the relator or deny the foreign country’s extradition request.Importantly, although extradition is neither a full trial nor a solely administrative function, relators are deemed to have certain constitutional rights when subject to extradition proceedings in the United States.However, the unique procedural characteristics of extradition do not align with notions of constitutionally mandated due process, as relators do not benefit from the constitutional protections that courts have recognized for criminal defendants.Judicial precedent also mandates that courts defer to the executive branch’s interpretation of extradition treaties.This deference has created friction between the judicial and executive branches, as the judiciary has been tasked with balancing relators’ due process rights against the executive branch’s foreign relations commitments to other sovereign nations. As the fundamental right to due process has been developed by international human rights bodies over the course of the 20th century, the judiciary’s deference to the executive branch has come into conflict with the advancement of due process as an international human right as well.",,0,html_body_unmatched

The Fourth Circuit’s interpretation also respects the relator’s fundamental right to due process as established by international human rights law.

First, the Ninth Circuit analyzed the purpose of the United States-Peru Extradition Treaty, noting that “Article I of the United States-Peru Extradition Treaty provides for extradition of ‘persons whom the authorities in the Requesting State have charged with, found guilty of, or sentenced for, the commission of an extraditable offense.’ ”Next, the Ninth Circuit provided background on Peruvian criminal procedure:",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"The Ninth Circuit looked at the text of the treaty to determine the significance of the “charging document” provision within the United States-Peru Extradition Treaty in its entirety. The court found that the addition of “the charging document” was not necessary to find that Peru satisfied the requirements of the extradition treaty, finding support inEmami v. United States District Court for the Northern DistrictandIn reAssarsson. In bothEmamiandAssarsson, there was no “formal charge” listed in the U.S.-Sweden and U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany treaties to find that a relator might be extraditable, and as such, the requirement that there be “formal charges” in the foreign jurisdiction before the foreign country filed an extradition request was not a necessary requirement to find that the relators were extraditable.The court utilized these cases even though neither case dealt with a “charging document” requirement. In Toledo’s case, the court found that “the Treaty does not mention formal charges or theOrden de Enjuiciamientoanywhere. And the requirement of a ‘copy of the charging document’—which specifies no particular document—does not define the level of formality [they] should read into ‘charged with.’ ”The court found that such a reading would allow theAcusación Fiscalto be permitted as a “charging document” given that language elsewhere in the U.S.-Peru treaty equated “charged with” to “sought for prosecution,” and that the documents indicating an individual was “sought for prosecution” could encompass documents submitted before theOrden de Enjuiciamientoin Peruvian criminal proceedings—that is, theAcusación Fiscal—therefore satisfying the treaty’s requirements.",,0,html_body_unmatched

Utilizing support from Supreme Court precedents, the court found that it should defer to the government agencies who were charged with negotiating and enforcing the treaty, as “such a construction enlarges the rights of the signatories and respects the interpretations given by [the] Executive Branch and the Peruvian government.”The court found that because the treaty does not require that the requesting country provide formal charges to satisfy the extradition treaty’s requirements when submitting an extradition request, theAcusación Fiscalwas sufficient to satisfy “the charging document” mandate. Moreover, in analyzing Peruvian criminal procedure, the court found that theAcusación Fiscalwas a “charging document” as it provided a plethora of evidence, serving “the important purpose in the Peruvian system of signaling the end of discovery and moving the case from the prosecutor’s office to a judge of the Preliminary Investigation Court.”",,0,html_body_unmatched

It did so under the standard default rule. Because the Treaty was meant to expand the rights of the parties involved (in this case, the United States and Peru) to encourage extradition and the Treaty did not specify what document was required to extradite Toledo under the “charging document” requirement,Acusación Fiscalcould be construed to be the charging document.

Ultimately, this approach to “the charging document” requirement in the United States-Peru Extradition Treaty hints at the judiciary’s use of the default rule to ensure that the rights of sovereign nations are not infringed upon when they file an extradition request with the United States.

Although Toledo raised the possibility of maltreatment and suffering while awaiting trial in a Peruvian prison, his argument failed to trigger a humanitarian concern by the court.Notably, courts in the United States may disavow the rule of non-inquiry should the relator raise the possibility of meeting human rights abuses by the requesting state in the event the extradition court certifies extradition—Toledo’s argument regarding his ill health does not align with the circumstances the court considers in extradition.On the other hand, Vitkus’s testimony about his arrest in Lithuania does support a contention that he could be tortured should the U.S. certify Lithuania’s extradition request, given that while applying for asylum, the “Board of Immigration Appeals (the ‘BIA’) found in 2014 that Vitkus’s ‘credible testimony established that he was beaten, burned, and nearly asphyxiated by [Lithuanian] police officers, who inquired into his contributions to a political party.”The findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals did not preclude the extradition court from certifying Vitkus for extradition.Vitkus’s torture in Lithuania—allegedly related to his political involvement in Lithuania with a political group called “the Russia party”—may have implicitly prompted the court to consider that the Lithuanian criminal proceedings would violate Vitkus’s human rights upon returning to Lithuania. This concern might have informed the Fourth Circuit’s view that “the charging document” requirement was a clear and unambiguous requirement that Lithuania provide a discrete charging document.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"In denying Lithuania’s extradition request, the Fourth Circuit may have chipped at the United States’ relationship with the Lithuanian government by rejecting the default rule.Although the U.S. government does not rescind the entire extradition treaty when the requestor country fails to extradite an individual, failing to extradite prohibits the flow of criminals between countries, and can encourage the impression that the U.S. can be held as a safe haven for criminals.Moreover, international comity would be ill-served by the uncertainty a requesting country may face when summoning an individual from the United States, should the relevant treaty have a “charging document” requirement.",,0,html_body_unmatched
,,,,"By continuing to find opportunities to utilize the default rule in interpreting extradition treaties, the judiciary is more likely to impinge on the constitutional due process rights of relators in an effort to appease the executive’s concern with maintaining foreign relations with sovereign countries.The divergence in interpretation of “the charging document” highlights the possibility of two diametrically opposite outcomes for those who face extradition, with important implications: the removal of an individual from the United States to a requesting country, and therefore, the removal of the constitutional rights afforded to them when they are physically in the United States.Vitkus v. Blinken, in acknowledging the default rule, noted that although there is a legitimate public interest in extraditing criminals to the countries that request them, the executive’s obligations to follow the law should not be outweighed by its duty to maintain foreign relations; doing so honors the procedural safeguards written into a treaty.",,0,html_body_unmatched

In Wang v. Masaitis, the petitioner argued that the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2) did not include agreements made between the United States and Hong Kong, which is a non-sovereign state. Id. at 993–94. The Ninth Circuit rejected the argument in finding that “the United States’ history of treaties with nonsovereign Indian nations fills in the silence of the Treaty Clause and the extradition statute with respect to the term ‘treaty.’ ” Id. at 999. In rejecting the court’s reasoning to justify the constitutionality of the treaty, the dissent noted that the “question of whether Hong Kong is a constitutionally cognizable treaty partner is committed to the political branches because it is inextricably linked to the President’s broad authority in the field of foreign relations.” Id. at 1001.",0,html_footnote_unmatched
