[was] a failed effort to bury the federalist interpretive theories of James Madison and reinvent the nature and origins of the American Constitution.”). This Article does not highlight recent criticism of Chief Justice Marshall to the same extent as it does with Madison, however, because a chorus of historians agree that Madison was inconsistent both about enumeration and the Bank question—each of which directly affects how scholars have understood federal incorporation in particular. E.g., Mary Sarah Bilder, Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention 2 (2015) [hereinafter Bilder, Madison’s Hand]. By contrast, while there is no question Chief Justice Marshall was a Federalist, Witt, supra, there is also no clear evidence that he was judging in bad faith when he wrote McCulloch . See David S. Schwartz, Misreading McCulloch v. Maryland , 18 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 1, 68 (2015) (arguing that “Marshall’s approach to implied powers reflects moderate, rather than aggressive nationalism”). Show More Scholars often read McCulloch v. Maryland for its holding that the Bank of the United States was constitutional. In doing so, they treat McCulloch as a singular case: the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States is a stand-alone issue—not about the legal form of federal incorporation which created the Bank, but about the Bank as a sui generis creation—and the constitutionality of the question ultimately turns on the Necessary and Proper Clause, more or less alone. 32 32.

Show More But as the Framers discussed themselves, they had specific reasons to omit the word for this corporate power. 23 23. 2 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 615–16 (Max Farrand ed., 1911) [hereinafter Farrand]; see also 3 Farrand, supra, at 375–76 (describing concerns that anti-bank sentiment would prevent Pennsylvania from ratifying should the power to charter corporations be included). Show More At the time the Constitution was drafted, anti-monopoly sentiment was high. 24 24. See infra Sections II.A–B. Show More The political climate meant that including the word “corporation” in the Constitution posed nothing less than a threat to ratification. 25 25. See 2 Farrand, supra note 23, at 615–16 (recording concerns raised at the Constitutional Convention that the inclusion of a corporate power would prejudice and divide the states against ratification); see also Bray Hammond, Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War 104–05 (1957) (citing reports of non-Convention members who were told that while individuals wished to propose that the Constitution authorize the charter of a bank, the mere mention of it would destroy ratification); 3 Farrand, supra note 23, at 375–76 (listing concerns that anti-bank sentiment would prevent Pennsylvania from ratifying the Constitution). Show More The Framers discussed drafting strategies which explicitly took into consideration that the corporate power could be drafted into the Constitution—and predictably relied upon as such—even if it was not expressly labeled by name. 26 26. 2 Farrand, supra note 23, at 615–16; see infra Part II. Show More The early Congress passed federal incorporation laws by an overwhelming majority. 27 27. The House voted 39-19 to adopt the bill chartering the First Bank of the United States. R.K. Moulton, Legislative and Documentary History of the Banks of the United States 13–18 (New York, G. & C. Carvill & Co. 1834). Show More And for years after ratification, the legal matter was uncontested: until James Madison raised political objections to the first bank bill and then again after that bill was passed, architects of government action relying on the corporate power did not appear to have thought it was necessary to engage in any sustained legal defense of their project. 28 28. See infra Section II.B; Ron Chernow, Alexander Hamilton 349–54 (2004) (explaining that Hamilton “had not foreseen the looming constitutional crisis that his bank bill was to instigate,” discussing the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, noting that the bill “virtually breezed through the Senate,” and observing that “nothing presaged” the fight over the Bank that was soon to emerge); see also Primus, Essential Characteristic, supra note 2, at 424 (“[A]s far as I can tell, nobody thought the [First] Bank raised that kind of [constitutional] problem at any time between Hamilton’s submitting his Report on a National Bank to Congress and shortly before Madison made his famous speeches in the House.”). That Congress resumed its use of federal incorporation in earnest after Madison’s defeat over the first bank bill, chartering a second bank among other things, further suggests that the weight of legal opinion was for, not against, federal incorporation. Show More As Part II explains, these facts together indicate that, as a legal matter, the corporate power was in the Constitution from the beginning. 29 29. See infra Section II.A. Richard Primus has suggested that the corporate power was left silent thanks to a coalition of those who rejected it outright and those who were worried that the naming of the power would have adverse political—but not legal—effects. See Primus, Essential Characteristic, supra note 2, at 427–28. This Article argues in Parts II and III that, whether or not this was the case, the legally predictable outcome of this approach—one which would have been clear to most lawyers at the time—was that the corporate power was enforceable. For the classic statement of predictability as legal knowledge, see Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 457 (1897). Show More",,98.11320754716981,matched

Section IV.A shows how we might develop an understanding of federal incorporation as positive law, independent from the administrative-, legislative-, and private-law categories scholars have previously struggled to reconcile out of necessity. Once we recognize that the corporate power is a stand-alone constitutional power, we can begin to describe its legal particulars, just like any other independent power or right. Federal corporations differ from state corporations and federal agencies in important ways. Among other things, federal corporations allow the federal government to craft a corporate form that includes the kind of substantive, not economic, rules that regulatory agencies are currently prohibited from imposing on state-chartered corporations. 47 47.

They are not the same thing as silent or unenumerated powers and rights, which are understood as existing in the Constitution itself. As a result, scholars of conventions are under no burden to find silent rights or powers. Because they exist in the same family of authoritative silent concepts, however, I nevertheless include them here. For a discussion on the distinction between “constructions” and the interpretation of rights or powers, see Jack M. Balkin, The New Originalism and the Uses of History, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 641, 648–54 (2013). Critics of “enumerationism” have argued that their work has substantive contemporary implications. But they have generally relied on existing dormant clauses which broadly gesture toward federal legislative power for that content—for instance, the General Welfare Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Preamble. Compare Coan & Schwartz, supra note 13, at 974–75, 977 (arguing that these three clauses are “most naturally read to create a federal government empowered to address all important national problems”), with Reinstein, supra note 15, at 7 (arguing that the General Welfare Clause is overbroad and that there is a four-point grouping of federal power clustered in categories that interact with the Necessary and Proper Clause but not creating a stand-alone right or power).

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963))). Justice Black’s worry about “ordered liberty” stemmed from not only his commitment to the hard-won First Amendment rights his fundamentalism protected, id. at 509 (“One of the most effective ways of diluting . . . a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning.”), but also the possibility that incorporation—extending federal constitutional rights to protect Americans against state overreach, which he supported—would be diluted if it were conflated with the “ordered liberty” test.

Since the  mid-century  high-water  mark  of  the  GCCA,  Congress  has  declined  to  engage  in  any holistic consideration of federal incorporation, both because it may itself be uncertain about the extent of its own powers in this respect and the utility of federal incorporation has, in certain ways this Article discusses, been augmented by this lack of both internal attention and external scrutiny. Congress's request for clarification about federal incorporation underscores that representatives may be uncertain about the scope of their own power. See Kosar, supra note 42, at 1-10. For a discussion of Congress's efforts to preserve its flexibility through a lack  of  uniformity  and  Congress's  continued  rejection  of  proposals  for  a  general  federal incorporation statute, see infra note 340.

Trillions of dollars circulate through the federal corporate form. Yet scholars often assume that the Constitution has nothing to say about corporations. The doctrine of federal incorporation, meanwhile, is confused: courts analogize federal corporations to state corporations or federal agencies, despite obvious inconsistencies, or avoid them altogether. As this Article demonstrates, however, the Framers understood the power to charter corporations as an independent power with its own prerogatives and limits, and there was little doubt about the power’s constitutionality following ratification. In fact, as this Article shows, the Marshall Court constructed doctrine defining this preexisting power across three cases— Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward , McCulloch v. Maryland , and Osborn v. Bank of the United States — establishing an independent threshold for the creation of federal corporations: “constitutional” purpose.

This approach is indebted to Philip Bobbitt, Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution 6–8 (1982), though the arguments here do not follow his modalities exactly. Show More Part I, which is discussed further in the Introduction, describes the twentieth-century case law of federal incorporation. Proceeding chronologically, Part II builds on recent advances in historical research, showing how the corporate power was drafted into the Constitution and illuminating the early legal parameters of the corporate power. As Part II shows, contemporaneous legal sources and the transcripts of the Constitutional Convention make clear that the Framers understood federal incorporation as a distinct legal power. There was no confusion that the power to incorporate was part of another field of law. 21 21. See infra Section II.B. Show More Further, the fact that the word “corporation” was left out of the Constitution did not mean that the power was legally absent. Scholars have sometimes taken this omission to signal that the possibility of a corporate power was rejected. 22 22. See Rakove, supra note 3, at 355 (describing as authoritative Madison’s argument that the power was rejected); Brest et al., supra note 1, at 27–28 (leaving open the question of whether the power was rejected or not for pedagogical reasons); cf. Winkler, supra note 2, at 3–5 (arguing that, while corporations influenced the Framers, the Framers never considered whether the Constitution applied to corporations). Show More But as the Framers discussed themselves, they had specific reasons to omit the word for this corporate power. 23 23. 2 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 615–16 (Max Farrand ed., 1911) [hereinafter Farrand]; see also 3 Farrand, supra, at 375–76 (describing concerns that anti-bank sentiment would prevent Pennsylvania from ratifying should the power to charter corporations be included). Show More At the time the Constitution was drafted, anti-monopoly sentiment was high. 24 24. See infra Sections II.A–B. Show More The political climate meant that including the word “corporation” in the Constitution posed nothing less than a threat to ratification. 25 25. See 2 Farrand, supra note 23, at 615–16 (recording concerns raised at the Constitutional Convention that the inclusion of a corporate power would prejudice and divide the states against ratification); see also Bray Hammond, Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War 104–05 (1957) (citing reports of non-Convention members who were told that while individuals wished to propose that the Constitution authorize the charter of a bank, the mere mention of it would destroy ratification); 3 Farrand, supra note 23, at 375–76 (listing concerns that anti-bank sentiment would prevent Pennsylvania from ratifying the Constitution). Show More The Framers discussed drafting strategies which explicitly took into consideration that the corporate power could be drafted into the Constitution—and predictably relied upon as such—even if it was not expressly labeled by name. 26 26. 2 Farrand, supra note 23, at 615–16; see infra Part II. Show More The early Congress passed federal incorporation laws by an overwhelming majority. 27 27. The House voted 39-19 to adopt the bill chartering the First Bank of the United States. R.K. Moulton, Legislative and Documentary History of the Banks of the United States 13–18 (New York, G. & C. Carvill & Co. 1834). Show More And for years after ratification, the legal matter was uncontested: until James Madison raised political objections to the first bank bill and then again after that bill was passed, architects of government action relying on the corporate power did not appear to have thought it was necessary to engage in any sustained legal defense of their project. 28 28. See infra Section II.B; Ron Chernow, Alexander Hamilton 349–54 (2004) (explaining that Hamilton “had not foreseen the looming constitutional crisis that his bank bill was to instigate,” discussing the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, noting that the bill “virtually breezed through the Senate,” and observing that “nothing presaged” the fight over the Bank that was soon to emerge); see also Primus, Essential Characteristic, supra note 2, at 424 (“[A]s far as I can tell, nobody thought the [First] Bank raised that kind of [constitutional] problem at any time between Hamilton’s submitting his Report on a National Bank to Congress and shortly before Madison made his famous speeches in the House.”). That Congress resumed its use of federal incorporation in earnest after Madison’s defeat over the first bank bill, chartering a second bank among other things, further suggests that the weight of legal opinion was for, not against, federal incorporation. Show More As Part II explains, these facts together indicate that, as a legal matter, the corporate power was in the Constitution from the beginning. 29 29. See infra Section II.A. Richard Primus has suggested that the corporate power was left silent thanks to a coalition of those who rejected it outright and those who were worried that the naming of the power would have adverse political—but not legal—effects. See Primus, Essential Characteristic, supra note 2, at 427–28. This Article argues in Parts II and III that, whether or not this was the case, the legally predictable outcome of this approach—one which would have been clear to most lawyers at the time—was that the corporate power was enforceable.

Second, as the current Court considers whether to invalidate existing jurisprudence which endorses “implied” rights, the existence of the charter power cuts against the theoretical case for doing so.
