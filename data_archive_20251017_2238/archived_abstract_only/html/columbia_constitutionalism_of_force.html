				<p>The Foundersâ constitutionâthe one they had before the Revolution and the one they fought the Revolution to preserveâwas one in which violence played a lawmaking role. An embrace of violence to assert constitutional claims is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by the Founding generation, who sincerely believed that people âare only as free as they deserve to beâ and that one could tell how much freedom people deserved by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it. This constitutionalism of force survived ratification. Its legacy is a constitutional order that legitimizes the violent assertion of rights, especially by groups of armed white menâa legacy that showed itself in the Republican National Committeeâs statement that the January 6 Insurrection amounted to âlegitimate political discourse.â We must acknowledge this heritage and the pressure it imposes on the rule of law if we are to survive todayâs authoritarian challenges to our democracy.</p>

		The fact that the January 6 rioters were misinformed puts them in good company with Americans of the Founding Era, as â[n]o oneÂ .Â .Â . can deny the prevalence of conspiratorial fears among the Revolutionaries.â Gordon S. Wood, Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth Century, 39 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 401, 403 (1982). Indeed, one historian has argued that the American Revolution is rooted in the actions of âhighly mobilizedâ disparate groups, each embracing âviolent direct action on the basis of false beliefs.â Jordan E. Taylor, What Pro-Trump Insurrectionists Shareâand DonâtâWith the American Revolution, Wash. Post (Jan. 7, 2021), https://<br />
www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/01/07/what-pro-trump-insurrectionists-share-dont-with-american-revolution/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>); see also Jordan E. Taylor, Misinformation Nation: Foreign News and the Politics of Truth in Revolutionary America (2022) (elaborating this thesis).<br />
Instead, what most sets January 6 apart is what we are beginning to learn about the involvement of the President himself, which has no precedent in American history. See Luke Broadwater, âTrump Was at the Centerâ: Jan. 6 Hearing Lays Out Case in Vivid Detail, N.Y. Times (June 9, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/us/politics/trump-jan-6-hearings.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>) (last updated June 11, 2022). That, however, is a topic for another article.	</span>

 and their message unsophisticated, their constitutional ideas donât matter. But I worry that they matter a great deal. And I do not think we can yet tell how much their beliefs will change our legal order.</p>
<p>In saying that the riotersâ beliefs about the constitution matter, Iâm not saying anything popular constitutionalism scholars havenât been saying these last twenty years or so. But I am saying it in a less happy, optimistic tone. And I will add that the many scholars who have elaborated upon Larry Kramerâs central idea in <em>The People Themselves</em> have gotten popular constitutionalism, as it has actually existed in American life, quite wrong, primarily because they have failed to take violence seriously.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		Larry Kramer ended <em>The People Themselves</em> envisioning a Supreme Court that showed the same deference to popular opinion that lower courts accord the Court âwith an awareness that there is a higher authority out there with power to overturn their decisionsâan actual authority, too, not some abstract âpeopleâ who spoke once, two hundred years ago, and then disappeared.â Larry D. Kramer, The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review 253 (2004). Weâve had a chance to see how that would work in practiceânot at the Supreme Court but in Congress. In a profile in the<em> Atlantic</em>, Congressman Peter Meijer (RâMich.) recalled:<br />
&#8220;When the Capitol was finally secured and members returned to the House chamber, [he] expected an outraged, defiant House of Representatives to vote in overwhelming numbers to certify the election results, sending a message to the mob that Congress would not be scared away from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. But as he began talking with his colleagues, he was shocked to realize that more of themâperhaps far more of themâwere now preparing to object to the election results than before the riot.&#8221;<br />

One member told Congressman Meijer âthat no matter his belief in the legitimacy of the election, he could no longer vote to certify the results, because he feared for his familyâs safety.â Id.	</span>

		Kramerâs <em>The People Themselves</em> rediscovered the eighteenth-century Whiggish understanding of a constitution defined, in part, by the people out-of-doors and suggested that we use this as a model for modern constitutional regeneration. But the violence somehow disappeared as he translated that tradition from its eighteenth-century origins to modern life. See Kramer, supra note 5, at 249 (suggesting impeachment, budgetary maneuvers, and other legislative solutions to judicial overreachânot tarring and featherings, whippings, the stocks, the destruction of the officialsâ homes, coerced resignations in front of jeering crowds, or other eighteenth-century options). From the beginning, critics needled Kramer for suggesting a theory that, they said, boiled down to mob rule. But even those critics did not seem to take Kramer seriously enough to worry, as I do, that âthe peopleâsâ methods are bloody, instead arguing primarily that the idea was theoretically unsatisfying. See, e.g., Larry Alexander &amp; Lawrence B. Solum, Popular? Constitutionalism?, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1594, 1622 (2005) (book review) (arguing that mobs cannot continually sit, cannot claim to speak for all of the people, cannot make consistent or reviewable decisions, and âcannot exercise authority; they can only exercise powerâ); L.A. Powe, Jr., Are âthe Peopleâ Missing in Action (and Should Anyone Care)?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 855, 857 (2005) (book review).	</span>

<p>The early literature of âpopular constitutionalismâ aimed to ennoble and validate popular efforts to stir up the stasis and order of the American constitutionâusually in progressive directions.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		In a provocative 1988 article introducing a constitutional and historical argument for popular amendment of the Constitution, Professor Akhil Amar argued that â[i]ndividual rights, federalism, separation of powers, and ordinary representation all exist <em>under</em> our Constitution, but they all derive from a higher source,â that is, ââWe the People of the United States.ââ Akhil Amar, Philadelphia Revisited: Amending the Constitution Outside Article V, 55 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1043, 1103â04 (1988). A few years later, Professor Bruce Ackermanâs multivolume work developed a theory that throughout American history there have indeed been âconstitutional moments,â in which âWe the Peopleâ have stood up in defense of a new understanding of the Constitution, eventually changing its meaning. See generally Â­Bruce Ackerman, We the People (1991â2018) (highlighting moments in American history that widened the franchise and expanded rights beyond the scope of the constitutionâs text). But, as Professor Randy Barnett later pointed out, having made the âSecond Reconstructionâ of the 1960s one such constitutional moment, Ackerman refused to see widespread popular mobilization <em>against</em> desegregation in the 1970s as constitutionally significant, describing it instead as the end of popular constitutional activity. Randy E. Barnett, We the People: Each and Every One, 123 Yale L.J. 2576, 2585 (2014). Professor Reva Siegelâs work stands as an important exception to this progressive-only view of when the âpeopleâsâ ideas should be thought âconstitutional,â as she has increasingly focused on the constitutional vitality of social movements on the right. See, e.g., Reva B. Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in<em> Heller</em>, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 192â94 (2008) (exploring the social movement that preceded the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 555 U.S. 570 (2008), examining how the âboundary between constitutional law and constitutional politics has been negotiatedâ). But all of these scholars have a blind spot when it comes to how violence has shaped the law.	</span>

 But in rediscovering that the American constitutional order is not static, this literature has ignored one of the dominant mechanisms of change. The appeal to arms as a way of validating legal arguments is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by our Founding generation, who sinÂ­cerely believed that people âare only as free as they deserve to beâ and, relatedly, that one can tell how much freedom people deserve by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>The optimism of early popular constitutionalism scholarship built on the work of so-called âneo-Whigâ historians, the school dominated by ProÂ­fessors Bernard Bailyn, Edmund Morgan, and Gordon S. Wood, among others.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		This group of scholars has been given several labels, including âWhigâ historians, âconsensusâ school, and neo-Whig. See, e.g., Thomas P. Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America: Reflections and New Directions, 115 Pa. Mag. Hist. &amp; Biography 3, 4â6 (1991) [hereinafter Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America] (discussing the âWhig,â âneo-Whig,â or âconsensusâ interpretative perspective). All agree that âconsensus schoolâ fairly points to Professor Richard Hofstadter and scholars grouped around his era and paradigm of thought, but Bailyn and Wood have also been regularly tarred with the âconsensusâ epithet over the years. Justin Driver, The Consensus Constitution, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 755, 757 (2011). See Bernard Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (2d ed. 1992) [hereinafter Bailyn, Ideological Origins]; Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776â1787 (2d ed. 1998) [hereinafter Wood, Creation of the American Republic].	</span>

 This is hardly surprising, as these were still the leading working historians when Professors Bruce Ackerman, Akhil Amar, Larry Kramer, and the rest were first developing their theories. And as neo-Whig history, especially Woodâs <em>Creation of the American Republic</em>, remains the go-to citation for Supreme Court opinions, it is, in a sense, our official state narrative.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		No works of history are. A journalist once asked Eric Foner, the acclaimed Civil War historian, â[W]hen did historians stop relating facts and start all this revising of interpretations of the past?â He replied, âAround the time of Thucydides.â Eric Foner, Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, at xvii (2003). Historians strive to tell a true story about the past, but in choosing some facts to emphasize and build into a coherent narrative, we suppress available alternatives. We do our best to characterize the past truthfully, knowing that other historians with equal integrity will make different choices. We welcome well-constructed and deeply researched alternatives when they come because the competing iterations build together toward something like the true complexity of the past. Of course, I do not mean to âimply that all historical arguments are created equalâ or that historians âstand helplessâ unable âto distinguish divergent accounts.â William J. Novak, Constitutional Theology: The Revival of Whig History in American Public Law, 2010 Mich. St. L. Rev. 623, 628.	</span>

 A theme of neo-Whig history is that the American Revolution unleashed, in Bailynâs words, a âcontagion of liberty,â subjecting slavery and the other injustices of its day to âsevere pressureâ and advancing a âspirit ofÂ .Â .Â . idealismâ at a ârapid, irreversible, and irresistibleâ pace.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		See Young &amp; Nobles, supra note 21, at 57â58 (discussing Edmund Morganâs deficits on this score). Those scholars who discussed race more directly during the 1960s were âlike the white mainstream culture from which most of them came and to which most of them spoke, less concerned with blacks themselves than with white attitudes and responses toward blacks.â Peter H. Wood, âI Did the Best I Could for My Dayâ: The Study of Early Black History During the Second Reconstruction, 1960 to 1976, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 185, 189 (1978). And how could it be otherwise? In historical accounts concerned with the white citizenâs âinevitableâ realization of his nationâs majestic core values of liberty and equality, the Black American can only be an inert objectâany amelioration of his position is but evidence of othersâ moral progress. In 1968, in his Presidential Address, the leader of the Organization of American Historians warned against African Americansâ insistence âon visibility, if not overvisibility, in the textbooks,â a project that could âwin little support from true scholarship.â Id. at 218â19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas A. Bailey, The Mythmakers of American History, 55 J. Am. Hist. 5, 7â8 (1968)). âThe luckless African-Americans while in slavery were essentially in jail; and we certainly would not write the story of a nation in terms of its prison population.â Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bailey, supra, at 8).	</span>

		Lin-Manuel Mirandaâs musical <em>Hamilton</em>, which opened during the Obama presidency, is like the neo-Whig history in that it emerged in another moment of optimism. It barely mentions slavery, uses actors of color as the Patriot Founders, and casts white actors for the Loyalists and King George. It thereby associates the âfreedomâ and âlibertyâ that the American Patriots fought for with the freedom struggles of Black and brown peoples against white supremacist and colonial regimes. Many of those Patriot Founders, however, owned slaves or otherwise participated in or profited from Black slavery, a vast system of kidnapping and torture and rape. The actual historical figures <em>Hamilton</em> depicts knew that slavery was wrong but founded a nation with slavery at its heart anyway. See Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Constitutional Convention: Making a Covenant With Death, <em>in</em> Beyond Confederation: Origins of the Constitution and American National Identity 188, 193â97 (Richard Beeman, Stephen Botein &amp; Edward C. Carter II eds., 1987). The musicalâs innovative casting works an insidious erasure of that history. This was not, of course, the playwrightâs intention. There was a poignant moment soon after the transition to the Trump presidency that seemed to highlight that the optimism or, perhaps, the complacency of the Obama years had always been important context supporting the showâs ebullient message. See Christopher Mele &amp; Patrick Healy, â<em>Hamilton</em>â Had Some Unscripted Lines for Pence. Trump Wasnât Happy., N.Y. Times (Nov. 19, 2016), https://www.nytimes.com/<br />
2016/11/19/us/mike-pence-hamilton.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>). With Vice President Mike Pence in the audience, the cast of <em>Hamilton</em> evidently did not feel that the show, by itself, did enough to represent their âAmerican values,â including their stance on the âinalienable rightsâ of âdiverse America.â Id.	</span>

 Instead, it makes more sense to ask: What is the path that led us here?</p>
<p>There are more than enough signs, for those looking to find them, that violence has been an integral part of the American system of governÂ­ment from the Founding era. That is because we are the inheritors of not one constitutional tradition from that era but two. One is a constitution-alism of institutions created by text along with a practice of turning to those institutions to resolve political differences.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

exhibits/featured-documents/magna-carta [https://perma.cc/CC8U-NMGH] (last visited July 26, 2022). Each of these architectural elements, both the textual truism and the pictorial origin story, have become a sort of anodyne pap for the first-year law student. But as constitutional philosophy, these sentiments are in opposition. Equal justice, the system of text- and precedent-based law that gives to each claimant the same principled answer, is not compatible with a system that awards rights to those few who win by force of arms. If these elements both belong on the face of the Supreme Court building, it is because of that tension. Together they help to express a contradiction at the core of our legal culture.	</span>

 But this Article argues that the Federalists were not able to suppress or to fully transform Americansâ constitutionalism of force.</p>
<p>The constitutionalism of force endures. Even as our institutional traditions have grown more dominant over the centuries, it is nonetheless impossible to fully account for the ordering of our society or for the interpretation of the textual Constitution without also understanding that violence has at times fueled the Constitutionâs evolution and defined the limits of constitutional amendment by more formal means.

<p>If America has a constitutional order that has endured since the Founding moment, that order is a blend of text and violence. The Foundersâ legitimation of violence is not a point of historical interest that has since been âfixedâ and safely resolved. Resort to violence to resolve constiÂ­tutional questions has instead been a recurring theme, one that is not as acute in every era but that resurfaces frequently. When it does, it poses a serious threat to the rule of law system and the institutional tradiÂ­tions we have nurtured and strengthened over the course of our history.</p>
<p>We have inherited the Federalistsâ failures, and these days we may feel them even more keenly than the Federalistsâ many successes. Violent movements have power to change our constitutional order. As a result, we are now in a time as precarious and as open to influence as any of the other key moments in our countryâs formation.</p>

Taylor, Misinformation Nation: Foreign News and the Politics of Truth in Revolutionary America (2022) (elaborating this thesis).\r\nInstead, what most sets January 6 apart is what we are beginning to learn about the involvement of the President himself, which has no precedent in American history.

That, however, is a topic for another article.[\/footnote] and their message unsophisticated, their constitutional ideas don\u2019t matter. But I worry that they matter a great deal. And I do not think we can yet tell how much their beliefs will change our legal order.\r\n\r\nIn saying that the rioters\u2019 beliefs about the constitution matter, I\u2019m not saying anything popular constitutionalism scholars haven\u2019t been saying these last twenty years or so. But I am saying it in a less happy, optimistic tone. And I will add that the many scholars who have elaborated upon Larry Kramer\u2019s central idea in <em>The People Themselves<\/em> have gotten popular constitutionalism, as it has actually existed in American life, quite wrong, primarily because they have failed to take violence seriously.[footnote]Larry Kramer ended <em>The People Themselves<\/em> envisioning a Supreme Court that showed the same deference to popular opinion that lower courts accord the Court \u201cwith an awareness that there is a higher authority out there with power to overturn their decisions\u2014an actual authority, too, not some abstract \u2018people\u2019 who spoke once, two hundred years ago, and then disappeared.\u201d Larry D. Kramer, The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review 253 (2004). We\u2019ve had a chance to see how that would work in practice\u2014not at the Supreme Court but in Congress. In a profile in the<em> Atlantic<\/em>, Congressman Peter Meijer (R\u2013Mich.) recalled:\r\n\"When the Capitol was finally secured and members returned to the House chamber, [he] expected an outraged, defiant House of Representatives to vote in overwhelming numbers to certify the election results, sending a message to the mob that Congress would not be scared away from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. But as he began talking with his colleagues, he was shocked to realize that more of them\u2014perhaps far more of them\u2014were now preparing to object to the election results than before the riot.\"\r\nTim Alberta, What the GOP Does to Its Own Dissenters, Atlantic (Dec. 7, 2021), https:\/\/\u200bwww.theatlantic.com\/\u200bmagazine\/archive\/2022\/01\/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach\/\u200b620844\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/LJ8T-3SQ7]. One member told Congressman Meijer \u201cthat no matter his belief in the legitimacy of the election, he could no longer vote to certify the results, because he feared for his family\u2019s safety.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Riot is not only, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously put it, \u201cthe language of the unheard.\u201d[footnote]Interview by Mike Wallace with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (CBS television broadcast Sept. 27, 1966); see also 60 Minutes Staff, MLK: A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard, CBS News (Aug. 26, 2013), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] It has long been, and continues to be, the language of the heard as well.[footnote]Kramer\u2019s <em>The People Themselves<\/em> rediscovered the eighteenth-century Whiggish understanding of a constitution defined, in part, by the people out-of-doors and suggested that we use this as a model for modern constitutional regeneration. But the violence somehow disappeared as he translated that tradition from its eighteenth-century origins to modern life. See Kramer, supra note 5, at 249 (suggesting impeachment, budgetary maneuvers, and other legislative solutions to judicial overreach\u2014not tarring and featherings, whippings, the stocks, the destruction of the officials\u2019 homes, coerced resignations in front of jeering crowds, or other eighteenth-century options). From the beginning, critics needled Kramer for suggesting a theory that, they said, boiled down to mob rule. But even those critics did not seem to take Kramer seriously enough to worry, as I do, that \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d methods are bloody, instead arguing primarily that the idea was theoretically unsatisfying. See, e.g., Larry Alexander &amp; Lawrence B. Solum, Popular? Constitutionalism?, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1594, 1622 (2005) (book review) (arguing that mobs cannot continually sit, cannot claim to speak for all of the people, cannot make consistent or reviewable decisions, and \u201ccannot exercise authority; they can only exercise power\u201d); L.A. Powe, Jr., Are \u201cthe People\u201d Missing in Action (and Should Anyone Care)?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 855, 857 (2005) (book review).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe early literature of \u201cpopular constitutionalism\u201d aimed to ennoble and validate popular efforts to stir up the stasis and order of the American constitution\u2014usually in progressive directions.[footnote]In a provocative 1988 article introducing a constitutional and historical argument for popular amendment of the Constitution, Professor Akhil Amar argued that \u201c[i]ndividual rights, federalism, separation of powers, and ordinary representation all exist <em>under<\/em> our Constitution, but they all derive from a higher source,\u201d that is, \u201c\u2018We the People of the United States.\u2019\u201d Akhil Amar, Philadelphia Revisited: Amending the Constitution Outside Article V, 55 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1043, 1103\u201304 (1988). A few years later, Professor Bruce Ackerman\u2019s multivolume work developed a theory that throughout American history there have indeed been \u201cconstitutional moments,\u201d in which \u201cWe the People\u201d have stood up in defense of a new understanding of the Constitution, eventually changing its meaning. See generally \u00adBruce Ackerman, We the People (1991\u20132018) (highlighting moments in American history that widened the franchise and expanded rights beyond the scope of the constitution\u2019s text). But, as Professor Randy Barnett later pointed out, having made the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s one such constitutional moment, Ackerman refused to see widespread popular mobilization <em>against<\/em> desegregation in the 1970s as constitutionally significant, describing it instead as the end of popular constitutional activity. Randy E. Barnett, We the People: Each and Every One, 123 Yale L.J. 2576, 2585 (2014). Professor Reva Siegel\u2019s work stands as an important exception to this progressive-only view of when the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d ideas should be thought \u201cconstitutional,\u201d as she has increasingly focused on the constitutional vitality of social movements on the right. See, e.g., Reva B. Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in<em> Heller<\/em>, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 192\u201394 (2008) (exploring the social movement that preceded the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 555 U.S. 570 (2008), examining how the \u201cboundary between constitutional law and constitutional politics has been negotiated\u201d). But all of these scholars have a blind spot when it comes to how violence has shaped the law.[\/footnote] But in rediscovering that the American constitutional order is not static, this literature has ignored one of the dominant mechanisms of change. The appeal to arms as a way of validating legal arguments is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by our Founding generation, who sin\u00adcerely believed that people \u201care only as free as they deserve to be\u201d and, relatedly, that one can tell how much freedom people deserve by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it.[footnote]This is Samuel Adams\u2019s axiom from the Revolutionary era that \u201cnations were as free as they deserved to be.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Furstenberg, Beyond Freedom and Slavery: Autonomy, Virtue, and Resistance in Early American Political Discourse, 89 J. Am. Hist. 1295, 1295 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Letter from Benjamin Rush to John Adams (July 20, 1812), <em>in <\/em>The Spur of Fame: Dialogues of John Adams and Benjamin Rush, 1805\u20131813, at 234, 234 (John A. Schutz &amp; Douglass Adair eds., 1966)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe optimism of early popular constitutionalism scholarship built on the work of so-called \u201cneo-Whig\u201d historians, the school dominated by Pro\u00adfessors Bernard Bailyn, Edmund Morgan, and Gordon S. Wood, among others.[footnote]This group of scholars has been given several labels, including \u201cWhig\u201d historians, \u201cconsensus\u201d school, and neo-Whig. See, e.g., Thomas P. Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America: Reflections and New Directions, 115 Pa. Mag. Hist. &amp; Biography 3, 4\u20136 (1991) [hereinafter Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America] (discussing the \u201cWhig,\u201d \u201cneo-Whig,\u201d or \u201cconsensus\u201d interpretative perspective). All agree that \u201cconsensus school\u201d fairly points to Professor Richard Hofstadter and scholars grouped around his era and paradigm of thought, but Bailyn and Wood have also been regularly tarred with the \u201cconsensus\u201d epithet over the years. Justin Driver, The Consensus Constitution, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 755, 757 (2011). See Bernard Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (2d ed. 1992) [hereinafter Bailyn, Ideological Origins]; Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776\u20131787 (2d ed. 1998) [hereinafter Wood, Creation of the American Republic].[\/footnote] This is hardly surprising, as these were still the leading working historians when Professors Bruce Ackerman, Akhil Amar, Larry Kramer, and the rest were first developing their theories. And as neo-Whig history, especially Wood\u2019s <em>Creation of the American Republic<\/em>, remains the go-to citation for Supreme Court opinions, it is, in a sense, our official state narrative.[footnote]Wood has not long been out of the Court\u2019s mind over the past three decades.

A journalist once asked Eric Foner, the acclaimed Civil War historian, \u201c[W]hen did historians stop relating facts and start all this revising of interpretations of the past?\u201d He replied, \u201cAround the time of Thucydides.\u201d Eric Foner, Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, at xvii (2003). Historians strive to tell a true story about the past, but in choosing some facts to emphasize and build into a coherent narrative, we suppress available alternatives. We do our best to characterize the past truthfully, knowing that other historians with equal integrity will make different choices. We welcome well-constructed and deeply researched alternatives when they come because the competing iterations build together toward something like the true complexity of the past. Of course, I do not mean to \u201cimply that all historical arguments are created equal\u201d or that historians \u201cstand helpless\u201d unable \u201cto distinguish divergent accounts.\u201d William J. Novak, Constitutional Theology: The Revival of Whig History in American Public Law, 2010 Mich. St. L. Rev. 623, 628.[\/footnote] A theme of neo-Whig history is that the American Revolution unleashed, in Bailyn\u2019s words, a \u201ccontagion of liberty,\u201d subjecting slavery and the other injustices of its day to \u201csevere pressure\u201d and advancing a \u201cspirit of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. idealism\u201d at a \u201crapid, irreversible, and irresistible\u201d pace.[footnote]Bailyn, Ideological Origins, supra note 10, at 230\u201332, 246.[\/footnote] Morgan taught the \u201cAmerican Revolution\u201d as Americans\u2019 \u201cnoble,\u201d \u201cdaring,\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d \u201csearch\u201d for \u201cnothing more or less than the principle of human equality\u201d\u2014\u201ca discovery that would turn the course of history in a new direction\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and liberate us from our past as it was soon to liberate them.\u201d[footnote]Edmund S. Morgan, The Birth of the Republic, 1763\u201389, at 3, 66 (4th ed. 2013). To be sure, the spirit of optimism pervading these works was not naivet\u00e9. It was an effort to tell a story about the survival of a republican aspiration to gradualist, nonviolent, pluralistic social change, and these works\u2019 relative optimism must be read in light of the recent conclusion of a war against authoritarianism (my thanks to Norm Silber for this insight).[\/footnote] Wood, Bailyn\u2019s student, emphasized the thought of the Federalists because, he explained, \u201cthe Federalists\u2019 intellectual achievement really transcended their particular political and social intentions\u201d and \u201cembodied what Americans had been groping towards from the beginning of their history.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 593\u2013615 (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Wood argued that Federalist ideas would endure and underpin a distinctly \u201cAmerican System of Government,\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] even as those ideas were \u201cadopted and expanded by oth\u00aders.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] One aspect of the Founders\u2019 genius, Wood insisted, was that they \u201cinstitutionalized and legitimized revolution,\u201d such that \u201cnew knowledge\u201d could be incorporated into governance \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 614.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis view of history must be understood as an artifact of a particular moment. In the 1950s and 1960s, Americans expressed a higher degree of trust in their government than at any other point since.[footnote]Pew Rsch. Ctr., Beyond Distrust: How Americans View Their Government 18 (2015), https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2015\/11\/23\/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KT6L-8NCV].[\/footnote] Victory in World War II gave the nation a coherent, if not messianic, idea of American cul\u00adture and destiny. An all-consuming battle against Soviet ideology then encouraged intellectual efforts to prove the integrity of the American political project.[footnote]See Alfred F. Young &amp; Gregory H. Nobles, Whose American Revolution Was It? Historians Interpret the Founding 48\u201351 (2011) (quoting a 1949 American Historical Association presidential address that \u201c[t]otal war, whether it be hot or cold, enlists everyone and calls upon everyone to assume his part\u201d).[\/footnote] A muscular administrative state had yet to fall under the relentless attack of the 1980s, and it seemed that the Federalists\u2019 vision\u2014Alexander Hamilton\u2019s vision\u2014for American empire was ascendant.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Legitimacy, Discretion, and the Concept of Rights, 92 Yale L.J. 1174, 1178\u201379 (1983) (describing the expansion of the administrative state); see also Jerry L. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution: The Lost One Hundred Years of American Administrative Law 29 (2012) (\u201cThe Federalist or Hamiltonian wing of the founding generation was keenly aware of the need to create a government with broad authority that could command the respect and the loyalty of the populace.\u201d).[\/footnote] The successes of the Civil Rights movement, first in <em>Brown v. Board<\/em> and then the Civil Rights Act, emboldened historians to downplay the horror of slavery as a doomed theme.[footnote]See Young &amp; Nobles, supra note 21, at 57\u201358 (discussing Edmund Morgan\u2019s deficits on this score). Those scholars who discussed race more directly during the 1960s were \u201clike the white mainstream culture from which most of them came and to which most of them spoke, less concerned with blacks themselves than with white attitudes and responses toward blacks.\u201d Peter H. Wood, \u201cI Did the Best I Could for My Day\u201d: The Study of Early Black History During the Second Reconstruction, 1960 to 1976, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 185, 189 (1978). And how could it be otherwise? In historical accounts concerned with the white citizen\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d realization of his nation\u2019s majestic core values of liberty and equality, the Black American can only be an inert object\u2014any amelioration of his position is but evidence of others\u2019 moral progress. In 1968, in his Presidential Address, the leader of the Organization of American Historians warned against African Americans\u2019 insistence \u201con visibility, if not overvisibility, in the textbooks,\u201d a project that could \u201cwin little support from true scholarship.\u201d Id. at 218\u201319 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas A. Bailey, The Mythmakers of American History, 55 J. Am. Hist. 5, 7\u20138 (1968)). \u201cThe luckless African-Americans while in slavery were essentially in jail; and we certainly would not write the story of a nation in terms of its prison population.\u201d Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bailey, supra, at 8).[\/footnote] It is in that context that the cheerful,\u00a0 triumphant neo-Whig\u00a0 version\u00a0 of\u00a0 American\u00a0 history\u00a0 emerged.[footnote]Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical <em>Hamilton<\/em>, which opened during the Obama presidency, is like the neo-Whig history in that it emerged in another moment of optimism. It barely mentions slavery, uses actors of color as the Patriot Founders, and casts white actors for the Loyalists and King George. It thereby associates the \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d that the American Patriots fought for with the freedom struggles of Black and brown peoples against white supremacist and colonial regimes. Many of those Patriot Founders, however, owned slaves or otherwise participated in or profited from Black slavery, a vast system of kidnapping and torture and rape. The actual historical figures <em>Hamilton<\/em> depicts knew that slavery was wrong but founded a nation with slavery at its heart anyway. See Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Constitutional Convention: Making a Covenant With Death, <em>in<\/em> Beyond Confederation: Origins of the Constitution and American National Identity 188, 193\u201397 (Richard Beeman, Stephen Botein &amp; Edward C. Carter II eds., 1987). The musical\u2019s innovative casting works an insidious erasure of that history. This was not, of course, the playwright\u2019s intention. There was a poignant moment soon after the transition to the Trump presidency that seemed to highlight that the optimism or, perhaps, the complacency of the Obama years had always been important context supporting the show\u2019s ebullient message. See Christopher Mele &amp; Patrick Healy, \u2018<em>Hamilton<\/em>\u2019 Had Some Unscripted Lines for Pence. Trump Wasn\u2019t Happy., N.Y.

With Vice President Mike Pence in the audience, the cast of <em>Hamilton<\/em> evidently did not feel that the show, by itself, did enough to represent their \u201cAmerican values,\u201d including their stance on the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d of \u201cdiverse America.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] These historians tried to gather a compelling narrative from the mass of information in the past and make it advance sensibly toward their present.

That is because we are the inheritors of not one constitutional tradition from that era but two. One is a constitution-alism of institutions created by text along with a practice of turning to those institutions to resolve political differences.[footnote]See supra notes 16\u201319 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We have been taught to understand that this is the end-all-be-all. But that\u2019s not right.\r\n\r\nWe are also the inheritors of the Founders\u2019 unwritten constitutional tradition. And under the unwritten constitution of their upbringing, the Founders made claims through action, won rights through usage, and maintained rights through uninterrupted custom.[footnote]As I have previously argued, \u201c[H]aving grown up as Britons, and having lost friends and family in a war to defend their rights as such, they\u201d would continue to think \u201cof themselves as the beneficiaries of a constitution of customary right.\u201d Farah Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places, 106 Va. L. Rev. 559, 565 (2020) [hereinafter Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places].[\/footnote] This Article demon\u00adstrates that under a constitution thus defined through praxis, violence formed a part of the legal lexicon. It was not just that people at times resorted to violence to get their way; British North Americans belonged to communities that recognized violence as a means of making legal arguments and preserving legal norms.[footnote]These competing traditions are well-represented in the architecture of our Supreme Court building. Text engraved on its architrave proclaims, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d while just underneath, the brass doors show King John sealing the Magna Carta following his defeat to the Rebel Barons at Runnymede.

Ct. of the U.S., https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/about\/buildingfeatures.aspx [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KL9D-VC4X] (last visited July 26, 2022); Magna Carta, Nat\u2019l Archives, https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/\r\nexhibits\/featured-documents\/magna-carta [https:\/\/perma.cc\/CC8U-NMGH] (last visited July 26, 2022). Each of these architectural elements, both the textual truism and the pictorial origin story, have become a sort of anodyne pap for the first-year law student. But as constitutional philosophy, these sentiments are in opposition. Equal justice, the system of text- and precedent-based law that gives to each claimant the same principled answer, is not compatible with a system that awards rights to those few who win by force of arms. If these elements both belong on the face of the Supreme Court building, it is because of that tension. Together they help to express a contradiction at the core of our legal culture.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Federalists tried to replace this constitution of community con\u00adsensus, of praxis, of action, and of force, with a written constitution. Their accomplishment, the neo-Whig historians taught us (skipping over the Civil War, which was not their period of expertise), was that we would thereafter fight out our controversies at the ballot box or in court.[footnote]See, e.g., Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 614 (\u201cAmericans had in fact institutionalized and legitimized revolution\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [N]ew knowledge about the nature of government could be converted into concrete form without resorting to violence.\u201d).[\/footnote] A writ-ten constitution was supposed to confine constitutional claimsmaking to text and institutions.[footnote]See id. at 613\u201315.[\/footnote] Neo-Whig historians and their students have described the Founding moment as the triumphant establishment by the era\u2019s elite of this <em>ordered<\/em> system, one so bloodless and rational that we can still discern its outlines and parse its Framers\u2019 intentions by looking at the text they set down.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] But this Article argues that the Federalists were not able to suppress or to fully transform Americans\u2019 constitutionalism of force.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionalism of force endures. Even as our institutional traditions have grown more dominant over the centuries, it is nonetheless impossible to fully account for the ordering of our society or for the interpretation of the textual Constitution without also understanding that violence has at times fueled the Constitution\u2019s evolution and defined the limits of constitutional amendment by more formal means. The Ku Klux Klan\u2019s campaign of terror defined the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments more than its framers\u2019 intentions did,[footnote]See John Patrick Daly, The War After the War: A New History of Construction 3\u20134 (2022) (arguing that the \u201ccomplete triumph of white supremacist military forces in 1877 settled many of the open issues of the legacy of the earlier Civil War,\u201d and \u201cex-Confederate extremists, with their military action,\u201d also \u201ccrippled\u201d each of the Reconstruction Amendments in the South); Steven Hahn, A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration 266 (2003) (observing that \u201c[b]etter than anyone,\u201d the freed slaves in the South \u201cunderstood that the rites of democracy had been built on rituals of violence and suppression directed against them,\u201d and \u201c[j]ust as \u201c[p]aramilitary organization\u201d had been central to slavery, \u201cit remained fundamental to the social and political order of freedom\u201d); id. at 265\u2013313 (discussing the martial efforts Southern Black Americans undertook in order to participate in democracy and the rise of paramilitary organizations like the Klan devoted to suppressing Black participation); see also Eric Foner, The Supreme Court and the History of Reconstruction\u2014and Vice-Versa, 112 Colum.

See generally Eric Foner, The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution (2019).[\/footnote] a scope formalized after the fact in <em>Plessy<\/em> <em>v<\/em>. <em>Ferguson<\/em>.[footnote]In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 544 (1896), the Court held that \u201c[t]he object\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cwas undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality.\u201d But critical issues, including what the \u201cnature of things\u201d consisted in and whether \u201csocial\u201d equality was a reasonable goal, were decided outside of the courthouse by paramilitary groups.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf America has a constitutional order that has endured since the Founding moment, that order is a blend of text and violence. The Founders\u2019 legitimation of violence is not a point of historical interest that has since been \u201cfixed\u201d and safely resolved. Resort to violence to resolve consti\u00adtutional questions has instead been a recurring theme, one that is not as acute in every era but that resurfaces frequently. When it does, it poses a serious threat to the rule of law system and the institutional tradi\u00adtions we have nurtured and strengthened over the course of our history.\r\n\r\nWe have inherited the Federalists\u2019 failures, and these days we may feel them even more keenly than the Federalists\u2019 many successes. Violent movements have power to change our constitutional order. As a result, we are now in a time as precarious and as open to influence as any of the other key moments in our country\u2019s formation.",

Wood, Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth Century, 39 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 401, 403 (1982).

Taylor, Misinformation Nation: Foreign News and the Politics of Truth in Revolutionary America (2022) (elaborating this thesis).\r\nInstead, what most sets January 6 apart is what we are beginning to learn about the involvement of the President himself, which has no precedent in American history. See Luke Broadwater, \u2018Trump Was at the Center\u2019: Jan. 6 Hearing Lays Out Case in Vivid Detail, N.Y.

That, however, is a topic for another article.[\/footnote] and their message unsophisticated, their constitutional ideas don\u2019t matter. But I worry that they matter a great deal. And I do not think we can yet tell how much their beliefs will change our legal order.\r\n\r\nIn saying that the rioters\u2019 beliefs about the constitution matter, I\u2019m not saying anything popular constitutionalism scholars haven\u2019t been saying these last twenty years or so. But I am saying it in a less happy, optimistic tone. And I will add that the many scholars who have elaborated upon Larry Kramer\u2019s central idea in <em>The People Themselves<\/em> have gotten popular constitutionalism, as it has actually existed in American life, quite wrong, primarily because they have failed to take violence seriously.[footnote]Larry Kramer ended <em>The People Themselves<\/em> envisioning a Supreme Court that showed the same deference to popular opinion that lower courts accord the Court \u201cwith an awareness that there is a higher authority out there with power to overturn their decisions\u2014an actual authority, too, not some abstract \u2018people\u2019 who spoke once, two hundred years ago, and then disappeared.\u201d Larry D. Kramer, The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review 253 (2004). We\u2019ve had a chance to see how that would work in practice\u2014not at the Supreme Court but in Congress. In a profile in the<em> Atlantic<\/em>, Congressman Peter Meijer (R\u2013Mich.) recalled:\r\n\"When the Capitol was finally secured and members returned to the House chamber, [he] expected an outraged, defiant House of Representatives to vote in overwhelming numbers to certify the election results, sending a message to the mob that Congress would not be scared away from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. But as he began talking with his colleagues, he was shocked to realize that more of them\u2014perhaps far more of them\u2014were now preparing to object to the election results than before the riot.\"\r\nTim Alberta, What the GOP Does to Its Own Dissenters, Atlantic (Dec. 7, 2021), https:\/\/\u200bwww.theatlantic.com\/\u200bmagazine\/archive\/2022\/01\/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach\/\u200b620844\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/LJ8T-3SQ7]. One member told Congressman Meijer \u201cthat no matter his belief in the legitimacy of the election, he could no longer vote to certify the results, because he feared for his family\u2019s safety.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Riot is not only, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously put it, \u201cthe language of the unheard.\u201d[footnote]Interview by Mike Wallace with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (CBS television broadcast Sept. 27, 1966); see also 60 Minutes Staff, MLK: A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard, CBS News (Aug. 26, 2013), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] It has long been, and continues to be, the language of the heard as well.[footnote]Kramer\u2019s <em>The People Themselves<\/em> rediscovered the eighteenth-century Whiggish understanding of a constitution defined, in part, by the people out-of-doors and suggested that we use this as a model for modern constitutional regeneration. But the violence somehow disappeared as he translated that tradition from its eighteenth-century origins to modern life. See Kramer, supra note 5, at 249 (suggesting impeachment, budgetary maneuvers, and other legislative solutions to judicial overreach\u2014not tarring and featherings, whippings, the stocks, the destruction of the officials\u2019 homes, coerced resignations in front of jeering crowds, or other eighteenth-century options). From the beginning, critics needled Kramer for suggesting a theory that, they said, boiled down to mob rule. But even those critics did not seem to take Kramer seriously enough to worry, as I do, that \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d methods are bloody, instead arguing primarily that the idea was theoretically unsatisfying. See, e.g., Larry Alexander &amp; Lawrence B. Solum, Popular? Constitutionalism?, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1594, 1622 (2005) (book review) (arguing that mobs cannot continually sit, cannot claim to speak for all of the people, cannot make consistent or reviewable decisions, and \u201ccannot exercise authority; they can only exercise power\u201d); L.A. Powe, Jr., Are \u201cthe People\u201d Missing in Action (and Should Anyone Care)?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 855, 857 (2005) (book review).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe early literature of \u201cpopular constitutionalism\u201d aimed to ennoble and validate popular efforts to stir up the stasis and order of the American constitution\u2014usually in progressive directions.[footnote]In a provocative 1988 article introducing a constitutional and historical argument for popular amendment of the Constitution, Professor Akhil Amar argued that \u201c[i]ndividual rights, federalism, separation of powers, and ordinary representation all exist <em>under<\/em> our Constitution, but they all derive from a higher source,\u201d that is, \u201c\u2018We the People of the United States.\u2019\u201d Akhil Amar, Philadelphia Revisited: Amending the Constitution Outside Article V, 55 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1043, 1103\u201304 (1988). A few years later, Professor Bruce Ackerman\u2019s multivolume work developed a theory that throughout American history there have indeed been \u201cconstitutional moments,\u201d in which \u201cWe the People\u201d have stood up in defense of a new understanding of the Constitution, eventually changing its meaning. See generally \u00adBruce Ackerman, We the People (1991\u20132018) (highlighting moments in American history that widened the franchise and expanded rights beyond the scope of the constitution\u2019s text). But, as Professor Randy Barnett later pointed out, having made the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s one such constitutional moment, Ackerman refused to see widespread popular mobilization <em>against<\/em> desegregation in the 1970s as constitutionally significant, describing it instead as the end of popular constitutional activity. Randy E. Barnett, We the People: Each and Every One, 123 Yale L.J. 2576, 2585 (2014). Professor Reva Siegel\u2019s work stands as an important exception to this progressive-only view of when the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d ideas should be thought \u201cconstitutional,\u201d as she has increasingly focused on the constitutional vitality of social movements on the right. See, e.g., Reva B. Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in<em> Heller<\/em>, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 192\u201394 (2008) (exploring the social movement that preceded the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 555 U.S. 570 (2008), examining how the \u201cboundary between constitutional law and constitutional politics has been negotiated\u201d). But all of these scholars have a blind spot when it comes to how violence has shaped the law.[\/footnote] But in rediscovering that the American constitutional order is not static, this literature has ignored one of the dominant mechanisms of change. The appeal to arms as a way of validating legal arguments is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by our Founding generation, who sin\u00adcerely believed that people \u201care only as free as they deserve to be\u201d and, relatedly, that one can tell how much freedom people deserve by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it.[footnote]This is Samuel Adams\u2019s axiom from the Revolutionary era that \u201cnations were as free as they deserved to be.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Furstenberg, Beyond Freedom and Slavery: Autonomy, Virtue, and Resistance in Early American Political Discourse, 89 J. Am. Hist. 1295, 1295 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Letter from Benjamin Rush to John Adams (July 20, 1812), <em>in <\/em>The Spur of Fame: Dialogues of John Adams and Benjamin Rush, 1805\u20131813, at 234, 234 (John A. Schutz &amp; Douglass Adair eds., 1966)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe optimism of early popular constitutionalism scholarship built on the work of so-called \u201cneo-Whig\u201d historians, the school dominated by Pro\u00adfessors Bernard Bailyn, Edmund Morgan, and Gordon S. Wood, among others.[footnote]This group of scholars has been given several labels, including \u201cWhig\u201d historians, \u201cconsensus\u201d school, and neo-Whig. See, e.g., Thomas P. Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America: Reflections and New Directions, 115 Pa. Mag. Hist. &amp; Biography 3, 4\u20136 (1991) [hereinafter Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America] (discussing the \u201cWhig,\u201d \u201cneo-Whig,\u201d or \u201cconsensus\u201d interpretative perspective). All agree that \u201cconsensus school\u201d fairly points to Professor Richard Hofstadter and scholars grouped around his era and paradigm of thought, but Bailyn and Wood have also been regularly tarred with the \u201cconsensus\u201d epithet over the years. Justin Driver, The Consensus Constitution, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 755, 757 (2011). See Bernard Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (2d ed. 1992) [hereinafter Bailyn, Ideological Origins]; Gordon S.

And as neo-Whig history, especially Wood\u2019s <em>Creation of the American Republic<\/em>, remains the go-to citation for Supreme Court opinions, it is, in a sense, our official state narrative.[footnote]Wood has not long been out of the Court\u2019s mind over the past three decades.

A journalist once asked Eric Foner, the acclaimed Civil War historian, \u201c[W]hen did historians stop relating facts and start all this revising of interpretations of the past?\u201d He replied, \u201cAround the time of Thucydides.\u201d Eric Foner, Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, at xvii (2003). Historians strive to tell a true story about the past, but in choosing some facts to emphasize and build into a coherent narrative, we suppress available alternatives. We do our best to characterize the past truthfully, knowing that other historians with equal integrity will make different choices. We welcome well-constructed and deeply researched alternatives when they come because the competing iterations build together toward something like the true complexity of the past. Of course, I do not mean to \u201cimply that all historical arguments are created equal\u201d or that historians \u201cstand helpless\u201d unable \u201cto distinguish divergent accounts.\u201d William J. Novak, Constitutional Theology: The Revival of Whig History in American Public Law, 2010 Mich. St. L. Rev. 623, 628.[\/footnote] A theme of neo-Whig history is that the American Revolution unleashed, in Bailyn\u2019s words, a \u201ccontagion of liberty,\u201d subjecting slavery and the other injustices of its day to \u201csevere pressure\u201d and advancing a \u201cspirit of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. idealism\u201d at a \u201crapid, irreversible, and irresistible\u201d pace.[footnote]Bailyn, Ideological Origins, supra note 10, at 230\u201332, 246.[\/footnote] Morgan taught the \u201cAmerican Revolution\u201d as Americans\u2019 \u201cnoble,\u201d \u201cdaring,\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d \u201csearch\u201d for \u201cnothing more or less than the principle of human equality\u201d\u2014\u201ca discovery that would turn the course of history in a new direction\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and liberate us from our past as it was soon to liberate them.\u201d[footnote]Edmund S. Morgan, The Birth of the Republic, 1763\u201389, at 3, 66 (4th ed. 2013). To be sure, the spirit of optimism pervading these works was not naivet\u00e9. It was an effort to tell a story about the survival of a republican aspiration to gradualist, nonviolent, pluralistic social change, and these works\u2019 relative optimism must be read in light of the recent conclusion of a war against authoritarianism (my thanks to Norm Silber for this insight).[\/footnote] Wood, Bailyn\u2019s student, emphasized the thought of the Federalists because, he explained, \u201cthe Federalists\u2019 intellectual achievement really transcended their particular political and social intentions\u201d and \u201cembodied what Americans had been groping towards from the beginning of their history.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 593\u2013615 (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Wood argued that Federalist ideas would endure and underpin a distinctly \u201cAmerican System of Government,\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] even as those ideas were \u201cadopted and expanded by oth\u00aders.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] One aspect of the Founders\u2019 genius, Wood insisted, was that they \u201cinstitutionalized and legitimized revolution,\u201d such that \u201cnew knowledge\u201d could be incorporated into governance \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 614.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis view of history must be understood as an artifact of a particular moment. In the 1950s and 1960s, Americans expressed a higher degree of trust in their government than at any other point since.[footnote]Pew Rsch. Ctr., Beyond Distrust: How Americans View Their Government 18 (2015), https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2015\/11\/23\/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KT6L-8NCV].[\/footnote] Victory in World War II gave the nation a coherent, if not messianic, idea of American cul\u00adture and destiny. An all-consuming battle against Soviet ideology then encouraged intellectual efforts to prove the integrity of the American political project.[footnote]See Alfred F. Young &amp; Gregory H. Nobles, Whose American Revolution Was It? Historians Interpret the Founding 48\u201351 (2011) (quoting a 1949 American Historical Association presidential address that \u201c[t]otal war, whether it be hot or cold, enlists everyone and calls upon everyone to assume his part\u201d).[\/footnote] A muscular administrative state had yet to fall under the relentless attack of the 1980s, and it seemed that the Federalists\u2019 vision\u2014Alexander Hamilton\u2019s vision\u2014for American empire was ascendant.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Legitimacy, Discretion, and the Concept of Rights, 92 Yale L.J. 1174, 1178\u201379 (1983) (describing the expansion of the administrative state); see also Jerry L. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution: The Lost One Hundred Years of American Administrative Law 29 (2012) (\u201cThe Federalist or Hamiltonian wing of the founding generation was keenly aware of the need to create a government with broad authority that could command the respect and the loyalty of the populace.\u201d).[\/footnote] The successes of the Civil Rights movement, first in <em>Brown v. Board<\/em> and then the Civil Rights Act, emboldened historians to downplay the horror of slavery as a doomed theme.[footnote]See Young &amp; Nobles, supra note 21, at 57\u201358 (discussing Edmund Morgan\u2019s deficits on this score). Those scholars who discussed race more directly during the 1960s were \u201clike the white mainstream culture from which most of them came and to which most of them spoke, less concerned with blacks themselves than with white attitudes and responses toward blacks.\u201d Peter H. Wood, \u201cI Did the Best I Could for My Day\u201d: The Study of Early Black History During the Second Reconstruction, 1960 to 1976, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 185, 189 (1978). And how could it be otherwise? In historical accounts concerned with the white citizen\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d realization of his nation\u2019s majestic core values of liberty and equality, the Black American can only be an inert object\u2014any amelioration of his position is but evidence of others\u2019 moral progress. In 1968, in his Presidential Address, the leader of the Organization of American Historians warned against African Americans\u2019 insistence \u201con visibility, if not overvisibility, in the textbooks,\u201d a project that could \u201cwin little support from true scholarship.\u201d Id. at 218\u201319 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas A. Bailey, The Mythmakers of American History, 55 J. Am. Hist. 5, 7\u20138 (1968)). \u201cThe luckless African-Americans while in slavery were essentially in jail; and we certainly would not write the story of a nation in terms of its prison population.\u201d Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bailey, supra, at 8).[\/footnote] It is in that context that the cheerful,\u00a0 triumphant neo-Whig\u00a0 version\u00a0 of\u00a0 American\u00a0 history\u00a0 emerged.[footnote]Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical <em>Hamilton<\/em>, which opened during the Obama presidency, is like the neo-Whig history in that it emerged in another moment of optimism. It barely mentions slavery, uses actors of color as the Patriot Founders, and casts white actors for the Loyalists and King George. It thereby associates the \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d that the American Patriots fought for with the freedom struggles of Black and brown peoples against white supremacist and colonial regimes. Many of those Patriot Founders, however, owned slaves or otherwise participated in or profited from Black slavery, a vast system of kidnapping and torture and rape. The actual historical figures <em>Hamilton<\/em> depicts knew that slavery was wrong but founded a nation with slavery at its heart anyway. See Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Constitutional Convention: Making a Covenant With Death, <em>in<\/em> Beyond Confederation: Origins of the Constitution and American National Identity 188, 193\u201397 (Richard Beeman, Stephen Botein &amp; Edward C. Carter II eds., 1987). The musical\u2019s innovative casting works an insidious erasure of that history. This was not, of course, the playwright\u2019s intention. There was a poignant moment soon after the transition to the Trump presidency that seemed to highlight that the optimism or, perhaps, the complacency of the Obama years had always been important context supporting the show\u2019s ebullient message. See Christopher Mele &amp; Patrick Healy, \u2018<em>Hamilton<\/em>\u2019 Had Some Unscripted Lines for Pence. Trump Wasn\u2019t Happy., N.Y. Times (Nov. 19, 2016), https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\r\n2016\/11\/19\/us\/mike-pence-hamilton.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). With Vice President Mike Pence in the audience, the cast of <em>Hamilton<\/em> evidently did not feel that the show, by itself, did enough to represent their \u201cAmerican values,\u201d including their stance on the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d of \u201cdiverse America.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] These historians tried to gather a compelling narrative from the mass of information in the past and make it advance sensibly toward their present. This is not a criticism of their work; that is the historian\u2019s craft.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re writing in a different context now.

Project on Sec. &amp; Threats (Aug. 6, 2021), https:\/\/cpost.uchicago.edu\/research\/domestic_extremism\/why_we_cannot_\r\nafford_to_ignore_the_american_insurrectionist_movement\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/42UZ-UBNU] (concluding from a survey that \u201cthe insurrectionist movement is more mainstream, cross-party, and more complex than many people might like to think\u201d).[\/footnote] In this context, it no longer makes sense to celebrate America as exceptional because we have discovered how to engage in politics \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 613\u201314.[\/footnote] Instead, it makes more sense to ask: What is the path that led us here?\r\n\r\nThere are more than enough signs, for those looking to find them, that violence has been an integral part of the American system of govern\u00adment from the Founding era. That is because we are the inheritors of not one constitutional tradition from that era but two. One is a constitution-alism of institutions created by text along with a practice of turning to those institutions to resolve political differences.[footnote]See supra notes 16\u201319 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We have been taught to understand that this is the end-all-be-all. But that\u2019s not right.\r\n\r\nWe are also the inheritors of the Founders\u2019 unwritten constitutional tradition. And under the unwritten constitution of their upbringing, the Founders made claims through action, won rights through usage, and maintained rights through uninterrupted custom.[footnote]As I have previously argued, \u201c[H]aving grown up as Britons, and having lost friends and family in a war to defend their rights as such, they\u201d would continue to think \u201cof themselves as the beneficiaries of a constitution of customary right.\u201d Farah Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places, 106 Va. L. Rev. 559, 565 (2020) [hereinafter Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places].[\/footnote] This Article demon\u00adstrates that under a constitution thus defined through praxis, violence formed a part of the legal lexicon. It was not just that people at times resorted to violence to get their way; British North Americans belonged to communities that recognized violence as a means of making legal arguments and preserving legal norms.[footnote]These competing traditions are well-represented in the architecture of our Supreme Court building. Text engraved on its architrave proclaims, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d while just underneath, the brass doors show King John sealing the Magna Carta following his defeat to the Rebel Barons at Runnymede. Building Features, Sup. Ct. of the U.S., https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/about\/buildingfeatures.aspx [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KL9D-VC4X] (last visited July 26, 2022); Magna Carta, Nat\u2019l Archives, https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/\r\nexhibits\/featured-documents\/magna-carta [https:\/\/perma.cc\/CC8U-NMGH] (last visited July 26, 2022). Each of these architectural elements, both the textual truism and the pictorial origin story, have become a sort of anodyne pap for the first-year law student. But as constitutional philosophy, these sentiments are in opposition. Equal justice, the system of text- and precedent-based law that gives to each claimant the same principled answer, is not compatible with a system that awards rights to those few who win by force of arms. If these elements both belong on the face of the Supreme Court building, it is because of that tension. Together they help to express a contradiction at the core of our legal culture.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Federalists tried to replace this constitution of community con\u00adsensus, of praxis, of action, and of force, with a written constitution. Their accomplishment, the neo-Whig historians taught us (skipping over the Civil War, which was not their period of expertise), was that we would thereafter fight out our controversies at the ballot box or in court.[footnote]See, e.g., Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 614 (\u201cAmericans had in fact institutionalized and legitimized revolution\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [N]ew knowledge about the nature of government could be converted into concrete form without resorting to violence.\u201d).[\/footnote] A writ-ten constitution was supposed to confine constitutional claimsmaking to text and institutions.[footnote]See id. at 613\u201315.[\/footnote] Neo-Whig historians and their students have described the Founding moment as the triumphant establishment by the era\u2019s elite of this <em>ordered<\/em> system, one so bloodless and rational that we can still discern its outlines and parse its Framers\u2019 intentions by looking at the text they set down.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] But this Article argues that the Federalists were not able to suppress or to fully transform Americans\u2019 constitutionalism of force.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionalism of force endures. Even as our institutional traditions have grown more dominant over the centuries, it is nonetheless impossible to fully account for the ordering of our society or for the interpretation of the textual Constitution without also understanding that violence has at times fueled the Constitution\u2019s evolution and defined the limits of constitutional amendment by more formal means. The Ku Klux Klan\u2019s campaign of terror defined the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments more than its framers\u2019 intentions did,[footnote]See John Patrick Daly, The War After the War: A New History of Construction 3\u20134 (2022) (arguing that the \u201ccomplete triumph of white supremacist military forces in 1877 settled many of the open issues of the legacy of the earlier Civil War,\u201d and \u201cex-Confederate extremists, with their military action,\u201d also \u201ccrippled\u201d each of the Reconstruction Amendments in the South); Steven Hahn, A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration 266 (2003) (observing that \u201c[b]etter than anyone,\u201d the freed slaves in the South \u201cunderstood that the rites of democracy had been built on rituals of violence and suppression directed against them,\u201d and \u201c[j]ust as \u201c[p]aramilitary organization\u201d had been central to slavery, \u201cit remained fundamental to the social and political order of freedom\u201d); id. at 265\u2013313 (discussing the martial efforts Southern Black Americans undertook in order to participate in democracy and the rise of paramilitary organizations like the Klan devoted to suppressing Black participation); see also Eric Foner, The Supreme Court and the History of Reconstruction\u2014and Vice-Versa, 112 Colum. L. Rev. 1585, 1587\u201390, 1592\u201393, 1602\u201303 (2012) (describing how historical writing of Reconstruction, which valorized the Ku Klux Klan, influenced the Supreme Court to limit the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments). See generally Eric Foner, The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution (2019).[\/footnote] a scope formalized after the fact in <em>Plessy<\/em> <em>v<\/em>. <em>Ferguson<\/em>.[footnote]In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 544 (1896), the Court held that \u201c[t]he object\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cwas undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality.\u201d But critical issues, including what the \u201cnature of things\u201d consisted in and whether \u201csocial\u201d equality was a reasonable goal, were decided outside of the courthouse by paramilitary groups.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf America has a constitutional order that has endured since the Founding moment, that order is a blend of text and violence. The Founders\u2019 legitimation of violence is not a point of historical interest that has since been \u201cfixed\u201d and safely resolved. Resort to violence to resolve consti\u00adtutional questions has instead been a recurring theme, one that is not as acute in every era but that resurfaces frequently. When it does, it poses a serious threat to the rule of law system and the institutional tradi\u00adtions we have nurtured and strengthened over the course of our history.\r\n\r\nWe have inherited the Federalists\u2019 failures, and these days we may feel them even more keenly than the Federalists\u2019 many successes. Violent movements have power to change our constitutional order. As a result, we are now in a time as precarious and as open to influence as any of the other key moments in our country\u2019s formation.",

Their claims were primarily about who won the election,[footnote]See Nicholas Fandos &amp; Emily Cochrane, After Pro-Trump Mob Storms Capitol, Congress Confirms Biden\u2019s Win, N.Y. Times (Jan. 6, 2021), https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\u200b2021\/\u200b01\/\u200b06\/\u200bus\/\u200bpolitics\/\u200bcongress-gop-subvert-election.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). [\/footnote] but they also asserted subsidiary arguments about whose opinion on that question mattered[footnote]\u201cNobody voted for Joe Biden\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d followed by the sneer, directed at a Black police officer defending the Capitol: \u201cYou hear that, guys, this nigger voted for Joe Biden.\u201d January 6 Committee Meeting With Capitol and D.C. Police, C-SPAN, at 01:23 (July 27, 2021), https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?513434-1\/capitol-dc-police-testify-january-6-attack (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (internal quotation marks omitted) (providing testimony of Officer Harry Dunn).[\/footnote] and how dis\u00adagreements ought to be settled.[footnote]See Fandos &amp; Cochrane, supra note 1.[\/footnote] On each of these points, the rioters were certain they were right. You might think that because the rioters were mis\u00adinformed[footnote]The fact that the January 6 rioters were misinformed puts them in good company with Americans of the Founding Era, as \u201c[n]o one\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. can deny the prevalence of conspiratorial fears among the Revolutionaries.\u201d Gordon S. Wood, Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth Century, 39 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 401, 403 (1982). Indeed, one historian has argued that the American Revolution is rooted in the actions of \u201chighly mobilized\u201d disparate groups, each embracing \u201cviolent direct action on the basis of false beliefs.\u201d Jordan E. Taylor, What Pro-Trump Insurrectionists Share\u2014and Don\u2019t\u2014With the American Revolution, Wash. Post (Jan. 7, 2021), https:\/\/\r\nwww.washingtonpost.com\/outlook\/2021\/01\/07\/what-pro-trump-insurrectionists-share-dont-with-american-revolution\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); see also Jordan E. Taylor, Misinformation Nation: Foreign News and the Politics of Truth in Revolutionary America (2022) (elaborating this thesis).\r\nInstead, what most sets January 6 apart is what we are beginning to learn about the involvement of the President himself, which has no precedent in American history. See Luke Broadwater, \u2018Trump Was at the Center\u2019: Jan. 6 Hearing Lays Out Case in Vivid Detail, N.Y. Times (June 9, 2022), https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/06\/09\/us\/politics\/trump-jan-6-hearings.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (last updated June 11, 2022). That, however, is a topic for another article.[\/footnote] and their message unsophisticated, their constitutional ideas don\u2019t matter. But I worry that they matter a great deal. And I do not think we can yet tell how much their beliefs will change our legal order.\r\n\r\nIn saying that the rioters\u2019 beliefs about the constitution matter, I\u2019m not saying anything popular constitutionalism scholars haven\u2019t been saying these last twenty years or so. But I am saying it in a less happy, optimistic tone. And I will add that the many scholars who have elaborated upon Larry Kramer\u2019s central idea in <em>The People Themselves<\/em> have gotten popular constitutionalism, as it has actually existed in American life, quite wrong, primarily because they have failed to take violence seriously.[footnote]Larry Kramer ended <em>The People Themselves<\/em> envisioning a Supreme Court that showed the same deference to popular opinion that lower courts accord the Court \u201cwith an awareness that there is a higher authority out there with power to overturn their decisions\u2014an actual authority, too, not some abstract \u2018people\u2019 who spoke once, two hundred years ago, and then disappeared.\u201d Larry D. Kramer, The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review 253 (2004). We\u2019ve had a chance to see how that would work in practice\u2014not at the Supreme Court but in Congress. In a profile in the<em> Atlantic<\/em>, Congressman Peter Meijer (R\u2013Mich.) recalled:\r\n\"When the Capitol was finally secured and members returned to the House chamber, [he] expected an outraged, defiant House of Representatives to vote in overwhelming numbers to certify the election results, sending a message to the mob that Congress would not be scared away from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. But as he began talking with his colleagues, he was shocked to realize that more of them\u2014perhaps far more of them\u2014were now preparing to object to the election results than before the riot.\"\r\nTim Alberta, What the GOP Does to Its Own Dissenters, Atlantic (Dec. 7, 2021), https:\/\/\u200bwww.theatlantic.com\/\u200bmagazine\/archive\/2022\/01\/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach\/\u200b620844\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/LJ8T-3SQ7]. One member told Congressman Meijer \u201cthat no matter his belief in the legitimacy of the election, he could no longer vote to certify the results, because he feared for his family\u2019s safety.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Riot is not only, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously put it, \u201cthe language of the unheard.\u201d[footnote]Interview by Mike Wallace with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (CBS television broadcast Sept. 27, 1966); see also 60 Minutes Staff, MLK: A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard, CBS News (Aug. 26, 2013), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] It has long been, and continues to be, the language of the heard as well.[footnote]Kramer\u2019s <em>The People Themselves<\/em> rediscovered the eighteenth-century Whiggish understanding of a constitution defined, in part, by the people out-of-doors and suggested that we use this as a model for modern constitutional regeneration. But the violence somehow disappeared as he translated that tradition from its eighteenth-century origins to modern life. See Kramer, supra note 5, at 249 (suggesting impeachment, budgetary maneuvers, and other legislative solutions to judicial overreach\u2014not tarring and featherings, whippings, the stocks, the destruction of the officials\u2019 homes, coerced resignations in front of jeering crowds, or other eighteenth-century options). From the beginning, critics needled Kramer for suggesting a theory that, they said, boiled down to mob rule. But even those critics did not seem to take Kramer seriously enough to worry, as I do, that \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d methods are bloody, instead arguing primarily that the idea was theoretically unsatisfying. See, e.g., Larry Alexander &amp; Lawrence B. Solum, Popular? Constitutionalism?, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1594, 1622 (2005) (book review) (arguing that mobs cannot continually sit, cannot claim to speak for all of the people, cannot make consistent or reviewable decisions, and \u201ccannot exercise authority; they can only exercise power\u201d); L.A. Powe, Jr., Are \u201cthe People\u201d Missing in Action (and Should Anyone Care)?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 855, 857 (2005) (book review).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe early literature of \u201cpopular constitutionalism\u201d aimed to ennoble and validate popular efforts to stir up the stasis and order of the American constitution\u2014usually in progressive directions.[footnote]In a provocative 1988 article introducing a constitutional and historical argument for popular amendment of the Constitution, Professor Akhil Amar argued that \u201c[i]ndividual rights, federalism, separation of powers, and ordinary representation all exist <em>under<\/em> our Constitution, but they all derive from a higher source,\u201d that is, \u201c\u2018We the People of the United States.\u2019\u201d Akhil Amar, Philadelphia Revisited: Amending the Constitution Outside Article V, 55 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1043, 1103\u201304 (1988). A few years later, Professor Bruce Ackerman\u2019s multivolume work developed a theory that throughout American history there have indeed been \u201cconstitutional moments,\u201d in which \u201cWe the People\u201d have stood up in defense of a new understanding of the Constitution, eventually changing its meaning. See generally \u00adBruce Ackerman, We the People (1991\u20132018) (highlighting moments in American history that widened the franchise and expanded rights beyond the scope of the constitution\u2019s text). But, as Professor Randy Barnett later pointed out, having made the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s one such constitutional moment, Ackerman refused to see widespread popular mobilization <em>against<\/em> desegregation in the 1970s as constitutionally significant, describing it instead as the end of popular constitutional activity. Randy E. Barnett, We the People: Each and Every One, 123 Yale L.J. 2576, 2585 (2014). Professor Reva Siegel\u2019s work stands as an important exception to this progressive-only view of when the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d ideas should be thought \u201cconstitutional,\u201d as she has increasingly focused on the constitutional vitality of social movements on the right. See, e.g., Reva B. Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in<em> Heller<\/em>, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 192\u201394 (2008) (exploring the social movement that preceded the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 555 U.S. 570 (2008), examining how the \u201cboundary between constitutional law and constitutional politics has been negotiated\u201d). But all of these scholars have a blind spot when it comes to how violence has shaped the law.[\/footnote] But in rediscovering that the American constitutional order is not static, this literature has ignored one of the dominant mechanisms of change. The appeal to arms as a way of validating legal arguments is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by our Founding generation, who sin\u00adcerely believed that people \u201care only as free as they deserve to be\u201d and, relatedly, that one can tell how much freedom people deserve by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it.[footnote]This is Samuel Adams\u2019s axiom from the Revolutionary era that \u201cnations were as free as they deserved to be.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Furstenberg, Beyond Freedom and Slavery: Autonomy, Virtue, and Resistance in Early American Political Discourse, 89 J.

Wood, among others.[footnote]This group of scholars has been given several labels, including \u201cWhig\u201d historians, \u201cconsensus\u201d school, and neo-Whig. See, e.g., Thomas P.

All agree that \u201cconsensus school\u201d fairly points to Professor Richard Hofstadter and scholars grouped around his era and paradigm of thought, but Bailyn and Wood have also been regularly tarred with the \u201cconsensus\u201d epithet over the years.

And as neo-Whig history, especially Wood\u2019s <em>Creation of the American Republic<\/em>, remains the go-to citation for Supreme Court opinions, it is, in a sense, our official state narrative.[footnote]Wood has not long been out of the Court\u2019s mind over the past three decades.

A journalist once asked Eric Foner, the acclaimed Civil War historian, \u201c[W]hen did historians stop relating facts and start all this revising of interpretations of the past?\u201d He replied, \u201cAround the time of Thucydides.\u201d Eric Foner, Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, at xvii (2003). Historians strive to tell a true story about the past, but in choosing some facts to emphasize and build into a coherent narrative, we suppress available alternatives. We do our best to characterize the past truthfully, knowing that other historians with equal integrity will make different choices. We welcome well-constructed and deeply researched alternatives when they come because the competing iterations build together toward something like the true complexity of the past. Of course, I do not mean to \u201cimply that all historical arguments are created equal\u201d or that historians \u201cstand helpless\u201d unable \u201cto distinguish divergent accounts.\u201d William J. Novak, Constitutional Theology: The Revival of Whig History in American Public Law, 2010 Mich. St. L. Rev. 623, 628.[\/footnote] A theme of neo-Whig history is that the American Revolution unleashed, in Bailyn\u2019s words, a \u201ccontagion of liberty,\u201d subjecting slavery and the other injustices of its day to \u201csevere pressure\u201d and advancing a \u201cspirit of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. idealism\u201d at a \u201crapid, irreversible, and irresistible\u201d pace.[footnote]Bailyn, Ideological Origins, supra note 10, at 230\u201332, 246.[\/footnote] Morgan taught the \u201cAmerican Revolution\u201d as Americans\u2019 \u201cnoble,\u201d \u201cdaring,\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d \u201csearch\u201d for \u201cnothing more or less than the principle of human equality\u201d\u2014\u201ca discovery that would turn the course of history in a new direction\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and liberate us from our past as it was soon to liberate them.\u201d[footnote]Edmund S. Morgan, The Birth of the Republic, 1763\u201389, at 3, 66 (4th ed. 2013). To be sure, the spirit of optimism pervading these works was not naivet\u00e9. It was an effort to tell a story about the survival of a republican aspiration to gradualist, nonviolent, pluralistic social change, and these works\u2019 relative optimism must be read in light of the recent conclusion of a war against authoritarianism (my thanks to Norm Silber for this insight).[\/footnote] Wood, Bailyn\u2019s student, emphasized the thought of the Federalists because, he explained, \u201cthe Federalists\u2019 intellectual achievement really transcended their particular political and social intentions\u201d and \u201cembodied what Americans had been groping towards from the beginning of their history.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 593\u2013615 (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Wood argued that Federalist ideas would endure and underpin a distinctly \u201cAmerican System of Government,\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] even as those ideas were \u201cadopted and expanded by oth\u00aders.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] One aspect of the Founders\u2019 genius, Wood insisted, was that they \u201cinstitutionalized and legitimized revolution,\u201d such that \u201cnew knowledge\u201d could be incorporated into governance \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 614.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis view of history must be understood as an artifact of a particular moment. In the 1950s and 1960s, Americans expressed a higher degree of trust in their government than at any other point since.[footnote]Pew Rsch. Ctr., Beyond Distrust: How Americans View Their Government 18 (2015), https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2015\/11\/23\/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KT6L-8NCV].[\/footnote] Victory in World War II gave the nation a coherent, if not messianic, idea of American cul\u00adture and destiny. An all-consuming battle against Soviet ideology then encouraged intellectual efforts to prove the integrity of the American political project.[footnote]See Alfred F. Young &amp; Gregory H. Nobles, Whose American Revolution Was It? Historians Interpret the Founding 48\u201351 (2011) (quoting a 1949 American Historical Association presidential address that \u201c[t]otal war, whether it be hot or cold, enlists everyone and calls upon everyone to assume his part\u201d).[\/footnote] A muscular administrative state had yet to fall under the relentless attack of the 1980s, and it seemed that the Federalists\u2019 vision\u2014Alexander Hamilton\u2019s vision\u2014for American empire was ascendant.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Legitimacy, Discretion, and the Concept of Rights, 92 Yale L.J. 1174, 1178\u201379 (1983) (describing the expansion of the administrative state); see also Jerry L. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution: The Lost One Hundred Years of American Administrative Law 29 (2012) (\u201cThe Federalist or Hamiltonian wing of the founding generation was keenly aware of the need to create a government with broad authority that could command the respect and the loyalty of the populace.\u201d).[\/footnote] The successes of the Civil Rights movement, first in <em>Brown v. Board<\/em> and then the Civil Rights Act, emboldened historians to downplay the horror of slavery as a doomed theme.[footnote]See Young &amp; Nobles, supra note 21, at 57\u201358 (discussing Edmund Morgan\u2019s deficits on this score). Those scholars who discussed race more directly during the 1960s were \u201clike the white mainstream culture from which most of them came and to which most of them spoke, less concerned with blacks themselves than with white attitudes and responses toward blacks.\u201d Peter H. Wood, \u201cI Did the Best I Could for My Day\u201d: The Study of Early Black History During the Second Reconstruction, 1960 to 1976, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 185, 189 (1978). And how could it be otherwise? In historical accounts concerned with the white citizen\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d realization of his nation\u2019s majestic core values of liberty and equality, the Black American can only be an inert object\u2014any amelioration of his position is but evidence of others\u2019 moral progress. In 1968, in his Presidential Address, the leader of the Organization of American Historians warned against African Americans\u2019 insistence \u201con visibility, if not overvisibility, in the textbooks,\u201d a project that could \u201cwin little support from true scholarship.\u201d Id. at 218\u201319 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas A. Bailey, The Mythmakers of American History, 55 J. Am. Hist. 5, 7\u20138 (1968)). \u201cThe luckless African-Americans while in slavery were essentially in jail; and we certainly would not write the story of a nation in terms of its prison population.\u201d Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bailey, supra, at 8).[\/footnote] It is in that context that the cheerful,\u00a0 triumphant neo-Whig\u00a0 version\u00a0 of\u00a0 American\u00a0 history\u00a0 emerged.[footnote]Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical <em>Hamilton<\/em>, which opened during the Obama presidency, is like the neo-Whig history in that it emerged in another moment of optimism. It barely mentions slavery, uses actors of color as the Patriot Founders, and casts white actors for the Loyalists and King George. It thereby associates the \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d that the American Patriots fought for with the freedom struggles of Black and brown peoples against white supremacist and colonial regimes. Many of those Patriot Founders, however, owned slaves or otherwise participated in or profited from Black slavery, a vast system of kidnapping and torture and rape. The actual historical figures <em>Hamilton<\/em> depicts knew that slavery was wrong but founded a nation with slavery at its heart anyway. See Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Constitutional Convention: Making a Covenant With Death, <em>in<\/em> Beyond Confederation: Origins of the Constitution and American National Identity 188, 193\u201397 (Richard Beeman, Stephen Botein &amp; Edward C. Carter II eds., 1987). The musical\u2019s innovative casting works an insidious erasure of that history. This was not, of course, the playwright\u2019s intention. There was a poignant moment soon after the transition to the Trump presidency that seemed to highlight that the optimism or, perhaps, the complacency of the Obama years had always been important context supporting the show\u2019s ebullient message. See Christopher Mele &amp; Patrick Healy, \u2018<em>Hamilton<\/em>\u2019 Had Some Unscripted Lines for Pence. Trump Wasn\u2019t Happy., N.Y.

With Vice President Mike Pence in the audience, the cast of <em>Hamilton<\/em> evidently did not feel that the show, by itself, did enough to represent their \u201cAmerican values,\u201d including their stance on the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d of \u201cdiverse America.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] These historians tried to gather a compelling narrative from the mass of information in the past and make it advance sensibly toward their present. This is not a criticism of their work; that is the historian\u2019s craft.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re writing in a different context now.

That is because we are the inheritors of not one constitutional tradition from that era but two. One is a constitution-alism of institutions created by text along with a practice of turning to those institutions to resolve political differences.[footnote]See supra notes 16\u201319 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We have been taught to understand that this is the end-all-be-all. But that\u2019s not right.\r\n\r\nWe are also the inheritors of the Founders\u2019 unwritten constitutional tradition. And under the unwritten constitution of their upbringing, the Founders made claims through action, won rights through usage, and maintained rights through uninterrupted custom.[footnote]As I have previously argued, \u201c[H]aving grown up as Britons, and having lost friends and family in a war to defend their rights as such, they\u201d would continue to think \u201cof themselves as the beneficiaries of a constitution of customary right.\u201d Farah Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places, 106 Va. L. Rev. 559, 565 (2020) [hereinafter Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places].[\/footnote] This Article demon\u00adstrates that under a constitution thus defined through praxis, violence formed a part of the legal lexicon. It was not just that people at times resorted to violence to get their way; British North Americans belonged to communities that recognized violence as a means of making legal arguments and preserving legal norms.[footnote]These competing traditions are well-represented in the architecture of our Supreme Court building. Text engraved on its architrave proclaims, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d while just underneath, the brass doors show King John sealing the Magna Carta following his defeat to the Rebel Barons at Runnymede.

Ct. of the U.S., https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/about\/buildingfeatures.aspx [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KL9D-VC4X] (last visited July 26, 2022); Magna Carta, Nat\u2019l Archives, https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/\r\nexhibits\/featured-documents\/magna-carta [https:\/\/perma.cc\/CC8U-NMGH] (last visited July 26, 2022). Each of these architectural elements, both the textual truism and the pictorial origin story, have become a sort of anodyne pap for the first-year law student. But as constitutional philosophy, these sentiments are in opposition. Equal justice, the system of text- and precedent-based law that gives to each claimant the same principled answer, is not compatible with a system that awards rights to those few who win by force of arms. If these elements both belong on the face of the Supreme Court building, it is because of that tension. Together they help to express a contradiction at the core of our legal culture.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Federalists tried to replace this constitution of community con\u00adsensus, of praxis, of action, and of force, with a written constitution. Their accomplishment, the neo-Whig historians taught us (skipping over the Civil War, which was not their period of expertise), was that we would thereafter fight out our controversies at the ballot box or in court.[footnote]See, e.g., Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 614 (\u201cAmericans had in fact institutionalized and legitimized revolution\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [N]ew knowledge about the nature of government could be converted into concrete form without resorting to violence.\u201d).[\/footnote] A writ-ten constitution was supposed to confine constitutional claimsmaking to text and institutions.[footnote]See id. at 613\u201315.[\/footnote] Neo-Whig historians and their students have described the Founding moment as the triumphant establishment by the era\u2019s elite of this <em>ordered<\/em> system, one so bloodless and rational that we can still discern its outlines and parse its Framers\u2019 intentions by looking at the text they set down.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] But this Article argues that the Federalists were not able to suppress or to fully transform Americans\u2019 constitutionalism of force.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionalism of force endures. Even as our institutional traditions have grown more dominant over the centuries, it is nonetheless impossible to fully account for the ordering of our society or for the interpretation of the textual Constitution without also understanding that violence has at times fueled the Constitution\u2019s evolution and defined the limits of constitutional amendment by more formal means. The Ku Klux Klan\u2019s campaign of terror defined the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments more than its framers\u2019 intentions did,[footnote]See John Patrick Daly, The War After the War: A New History of Construction 3\u20134 (2022) (arguing that the \u201ccomplete triumph of white supremacist military forces in 1877 settled many of the open issues of the legacy of the earlier Civil War,\u201d and \u201cex-Confederate extremists, with their military action,\u201d also \u201ccrippled\u201d each of the Reconstruction Amendments in the South); Steven Hahn, A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration 266 (2003) (observing that \u201c[b]etter than anyone,\u201d the freed slaves in the South \u201cunderstood that the rites of democracy had been built on rituals of violence and suppression directed against them,\u201d and \u201c[j]ust as \u201c[p]aramilitary organization\u201d had been central to slavery, \u201cit remained fundamental to the social and political order of freedom\u201d); id. at 265\u2013313 (discussing the martial efforts Southern Black Americans undertook in order to participate in democracy and the rise of paramilitary organizations like the Klan devoted to suppressing Black participation); see also Eric Foner, The Supreme Court and the History of Reconstruction\u2014and Vice-Versa, 112 Colum.

See generally Eric Foner, The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution (2019).[\/footnote] a scope formalized after the fact in <em>Plessy<\/em> <em>v<\/em>. <em>Ferguson<\/em>.[footnote]In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 544 (1896), the Court held that \u201c[t]he object\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cwas undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality.\u201d But critical issues, including what the \u201cnature of things\u201d consisted in and whether \u201csocial\u201d equality was a reasonable goal, were decided outside of the courthouse by paramilitary groups.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf America has a constitutional order that has endured since the Founding moment, that order is a blend of text and violence. The Founders\u2019 legitimation of violence is not a point of historical interest that has since been \u201cfixed\u201d and safely resolved. Resort to violence to resolve consti\u00adtutional questions has instead been a recurring theme, one that is not as acute in every era but that resurfaces frequently. When it does, it poses a serious threat to the rule of law system and the institutional tradi\u00adtions we have nurtured and strengthened over the course of our history.\r\n\r\nWe have inherited the Federalists\u2019 failures, and these days we may feel them even more keenly than the Federalists\u2019 many successes. Violent movements have power to change our constitutional order. As a result, we are now in a time as precarious and as open to influence as any of the other key moments in our country\u2019s formation.",

Wood, Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth Century, 39 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 401, 403 (1982).

Taylor, Misinformation Nation: Foreign News and the Politics of Truth in Revolutionary America (2022) (elaborating this thesis).\r\nInstead, what most sets January 6 apart is what we are beginning to learn about the involvement of the President himself, which has no precedent in American history. See Luke Broadwater, \u2018Trump Was at the Center\u2019: Jan. 6 Hearing Lays Out Case in Vivid Detail, N.Y.

That, however, is a topic for another article.[\/footnote] and their message unsophisticated, their constitutional ideas don\u2019t matter. But I worry that they matter a great deal. And I do not think we can yet tell how much their beliefs will change our legal order.\r\n\r\nIn saying that the rioters\u2019 beliefs about the constitution matter, I\u2019m not saying anything popular constitutionalism scholars haven\u2019t been saying these last twenty years or so. But I am saying it in a less happy, optimistic tone. And I will add that the many scholars who have elaborated upon Larry Kramer\u2019s central idea in <em>The People Themselves<\/em> have gotten popular constitutionalism, as it has actually existed in American life, quite wrong, primarily because they have failed to take violence seriously.[footnote]Larry Kramer ended <em>The People Themselves<\/em> envisioning a Supreme Court that showed the same deference to popular opinion that lower courts accord the Court \u201cwith an awareness that there is a higher authority out there with power to overturn their decisions\u2014an actual authority, too, not some abstract \u2018people\u2019 who spoke once, two hundred years ago, and then disappeared.\u201d Larry D. Kramer, The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review 253 (2004). We\u2019ve had a chance to see how that would work in practice\u2014not at the Supreme Court but in Congress. In a profile in the<em> Atlantic<\/em>, Congressman Peter Meijer (R\u2013Mich.) recalled:\r\n\"When the Capitol was finally secured and members returned to the House chamber, [he] expected an outraged, defiant House of Representatives to vote in overwhelming numbers to certify the election results, sending a message to the mob that Congress would not be scared away from fulfilling its constitutional obligations. But as he began talking with his colleagues, he was shocked to realize that more of them\u2014perhaps far more of them\u2014were now preparing to object to the election results than before the riot.\"\r\nTim Alberta, What the GOP Does to Its Own Dissenters, Atlantic (Dec. 7, 2021), https:\/\/\u200bwww.theatlantic.com\/\u200bmagazine\/archive\/2022\/01\/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach\/\u200b620844\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/LJ8T-3SQ7]. One member told Congressman Meijer \u201cthat no matter his belief in the legitimacy of the election, he could no longer vote to certify the results, because he feared for his family\u2019s safety.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Riot is not only, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously put it, \u201cthe language of the unheard.\u201d[footnote]Interview by Mike Wallace with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (CBS television broadcast Sept. 27, 1966); see also 60 Minutes Staff, MLK: A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard, CBS News (Aug. 26, 2013), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] It has long been, and continues to be, the language of the heard as well.[footnote]Kramer\u2019s <em>The People Themselves<\/em> rediscovered the eighteenth-century Whiggish understanding of a constitution defined, in part, by the people out-of-doors and suggested that we use this as a model for modern constitutional regeneration. But the violence somehow disappeared as he translated that tradition from its eighteenth-century origins to modern life. See Kramer, supra note 5, at 249 (suggesting impeachment, budgetary maneuvers, and other legislative solutions to judicial overreach\u2014not tarring and featherings, whippings, the stocks, the destruction of the officials\u2019 homes, coerced resignations in front of jeering crowds, or other eighteenth-century options). From the beginning, critics needled Kramer for suggesting a theory that, they said, boiled down to mob rule. But even those critics did not seem to take Kramer seriously enough to worry, as I do, that \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d methods are bloody, instead arguing primarily that the idea was theoretically unsatisfying. See, e.g., Larry Alexander &amp; Lawrence B. Solum, Popular? Constitutionalism?, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1594, 1622 (2005) (book review) (arguing that mobs cannot continually sit, cannot claim to speak for all of the people, cannot make consistent or reviewable decisions, and \u201ccannot exercise authority; they can only exercise power\u201d); L.A. Powe, Jr., Are \u201cthe People\u201d Missing in Action (and Should Anyone Care)?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 855, 857 (2005) (book review).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe early literature of \u201cpopular constitutionalism\u201d aimed to ennoble and validate popular efforts to stir up the stasis and order of the American constitution\u2014usually in progressive directions.[footnote]In a provocative 1988 article introducing a constitutional and historical argument for popular amendment of the Constitution, Professor Akhil Amar argued that \u201c[i]ndividual rights, federalism, separation of powers, and ordinary representation all exist <em>under<\/em> our Constitution, but they all derive from a higher source,\u201d that is, \u201c\u2018We the People of the United States.\u2019\u201d Akhil Amar, Philadelphia Revisited: Amending the Constitution Outside Article V, 55 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1043, 1103\u201304 (1988). A few years later, Professor Bruce Ackerman\u2019s multivolume work developed a theory that throughout American history there have indeed been \u201cconstitutional moments,\u201d in which \u201cWe the People\u201d have stood up in defense of a new understanding of the Constitution, eventually changing its meaning. See generally \u00adBruce Ackerman, We the People (1991\u20132018) (highlighting moments in American history that widened the franchise and expanded rights beyond the scope of the constitution\u2019s text). But, as Professor Randy Barnett later pointed out, having made the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s one such constitutional moment, Ackerman refused to see widespread popular mobilization <em>against<\/em> desegregation in the 1970s as constitutionally significant, describing it instead as the end of popular constitutional activity. Randy E. Barnett, We the People: Each and Every One, 123 Yale L.J. 2576, 2585 (2014). Professor Reva Siegel\u2019s work stands as an important exception to this progressive-only view of when the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d ideas should be thought \u201cconstitutional,\u201d as she has increasingly focused on the constitutional vitality of social movements on the right. See, e.g., Reva B. Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in<em> Heller<\/em>, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 192\u201394 (2008) (exploring the social movement that preceded the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 555 U.S. 570 (2008), examining how the \u201cboundary between constitutional law and constitutional politics has been negotiated\u201d). But all of these scholars have a blind spot when it comes to how violence has shaped the law.[\/footnote] But in rediscovering that the American constitutional order is not static, this literature has ignored one of the dominant mechanisms of change. The appeal to arms as a way of validating legal arguments is worked deeply into our intellectual history and culture. It was entailed upon us by our Founding generation, who sin\u00adcerely believed that people \u201care only as free as they deserve to be\u201d and, relatedly, that one can tell how much freedom people deserve by how much blood they were willing to shed to obtain it.[footnote]This is Samuel Adams\u2019s axiom from the Revolutionary era that \u201cnations were as free as they deserved to be.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Furstenberg, Beyond Freedom and Slavery: Autonomy, Virtue, and Resistance in Early American Political Discourse, 89 J. Am. Hist. 1295, 1295 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Letter from Benjamin Rush to John Adams (July 20, 1812), <em>in <\/em>The Spur of Fame: Dialogues of John Adams and Benjamin Rush, 1805\u20131813, at 234, 234 (John A. Schutz &amp; Douglass Adair eds., 1966)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe optimism of early popular constitutionalism scholarship built on the work of so-called \u201cneo-Whig\u201d historians, the school dominated by Pro\u00adfessors Bernard Bailyn, Edmund Morgan, and Gordon S. Wood, among others.[footnote]This group of scholars has been given several labels, including \u201cWhig\u201d historians, \u201cconsensus\u201d school, and neo-Whig. See, e.g., Thomas P. Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America: Reflections and New Directions, 115 Pa. Mag. Hist. &amp; Biography 3, 4\u20136 (1991) [hereinafter Slaughter, Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America] (discussing the \u201cWhig,\u201d \u201cneo-Whig,\u201d or \u201cconsensus\u201d interpretative perspective). All agree that \u201cconsensus school\u201d fairly points to Professor Richard Hofstadter and scholars grouped around his era and paradigm of thought, but Bailyn and Wood have also been regularly tarred with the \u201cconsensus\u201d epithet over the years. Justin Driver, The Consensus Constitution, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 755, 757 (2011). See Bernard Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (2d ed. 1992) [hereinafter Bailyn, Ideological Origins]; Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776\u20131787 (2d ed. 1998) [hereinafter Wood, Creation of the American Republic].[\/footnote] This is hardly surprising, as these were still the leading working historians when Professors Bruce Ackerman, Akhil Amar, Larry Kramer, and the rest were first developing their theories. And as neo-Whig history, especially Wood\u2019s <em>Creation of the American Republic<\/em>, remains the go-to citation for Supreme Court opinions, it is, in a sense, our official state narrative.[footnote]Wood has not long been out of the Court\u2019s mind over the past three decades.

A journalist once asked Eric Foner, the acclaimed Civil War historian, \u201c[W]hen did historians stop relating facts and start all this revising of interpretations of the past?\u201d He replied, \u201cAround the time of Thucydides.\u201d Eric Foner, Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, at xvii (2003). Historians strive to tell a true story about the past, but in choosing some facts to emphasize and build into a coherent narrative, we suppress available alternatives. We do our best to characterize the past truthfully, knowing that other historians with equal integrity will make different choices. We welcome well-constructed and deeply researched alternatives when they come because the competing iterations build together toward something like the true complexity of the past. Of course, I do not mean to \u201cimply that all historical arguments are created equal\u201d or that historians \u201cstand helpless\u201d unable \u201cto distinguish divergent accounts.\u201d William J. Novak, Constitutional Theology: The Revival of Whig History in American Public Law, 2010 Mich. St. L. Rev. 623, 628.[\/footnote] A theme of neo-Whig history is that the American Revolution unleashed, in Bailyn\u2019s words, a \u201ccontagion of liberty,\u201d subjecting slavery and the other injustices of its day to \u201csevere pressure\u201d and advancing a \u201cspirit of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. idealism\u201d at a \u201crapid, irreversible, and irresistible\u201d pace.[footnote]Bailyn, Ideological Origins, supra note 10, at 230\u201332, 246.[\/footnote] Morgan taught the \u201cAmerican Revolution\u201d as Americans\u2019 \u201cnoble,\u201d \u201cdaring,\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d \u201csearch\u201d for \u201cnothing more or less than the principle of human equality\u201d\u2014\u201ca discovery that would turn the course of history in a new direction\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and liberate us from our past as it was soon to liberate them.\u201d[footnote]Edmund S. Morgan, The Birth of the Republic, 1763\u201389, at 3, 66 (4th ed. 2013). To be sure, the spirit of optimism pervading these works was not naivet\u00e9. It was an effort to tell a story about the survival of a republican aspiration to gradualist, nonviolent, pluralistic social change, and these works\u2019 relative optimism must be read in light of the recent conclusion of a war against authoritarianism (my thanks to Norm Silber for this insight).[\/footnote] Wood, Bailyn\u2019s student, emphasized the thought of the Federalists because, he explained, \u201cthe Federalists\u2019 intellectual achievement really transcended their particular political and social intentions\u201d and \u201cembodied what Americans had been groping towards from the beginning of their history.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 593\u2013615 (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Wood argued that Federalist ideas would endure and underpin a distinctly \u201cAmerican System of Government,\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] even as those ideas were \u201cadopted and expanded by oth\u00aders.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] One aspect of the Founders\u2019 genius, Wood insisted, was that they \u201cinstitutionalized and legitimized revolution,\u201d such that \u201cnew knowledge\u201d could be incorporated into governance \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 614.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis view of history must be understood as an artifact of a particular moment. In the 1950s and 1960s, Americans expressed a higher degree of trust in their government than at any other point since.[footnote]Pew Rsch. Ctr., Beyond Distrust: How Americans View Their Government 18 (2015), https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2015\/11\/23\/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KT6L-8NCV].[\/footnote] Victory in World War II gave the nation a coherent, if not messianic, idea of American cul\u00adture and destiny. An all-consuming battle against Soviet ideology then encouraged intellectual efforts to prove the integrity of the American political project.[footnote]See Alfred F. Young &amp; Gregory H. Nobles, Whose American Revolution Was It? Historians Interpret the Founding 48\u201351 (2011) (quoting a 1949 American Historical Association presidential address that \u201c[t]otal war, whether it be hot or cold, enlists everyone and calls upon everyone to assume his part\u201d).[\/footnote] A muscular administrative state had yet to fall under the relentless attack of the 1980s, and it seemed that the Federalists\u2019 vision\u2014Alexander Hamilton\u2019s vision\u2014for American empire was ascendant.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Legitimacy, Discretion, and the Concept of Rights, 92 Yale L.J. 1174, 1178\u201379 (1983) (describing the expansion of the administrative state); see also Jerry L. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution: The Lost One Hundred Years of American Administrative Law 29 (2012) (\u201cThe Federalist or Hamiltonian wing of the founding generation was keenly aware of the need to create a government with broad authority that could command the respect and the loyalty of the populace.\u201d).[\/footnote] The successes of the Civil Rights movement, first in <em>Brown v. Board<\/em> and then the Civil Rights Act, emboldened historians to downplay the horror of slavery as a doomed theme.[footnote]See Young &amp; Nobles, supra note 21, at 57\u201358 (discussing Edmund Morgan\u2019s deficits on this score). Those scholars who discussed race more directly during the 1960s were \u201clike the white mainstream culture from which most of them came and to which most of them spoke, less concerned with blacks themselves than with white attitudes and responses toward blacks.\u201d Peter H. Wood, \u201cI Did the Best I Could for My Day\u201d: The Study of Early Black History During the Second Reconstruction, 1960 to 1976, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 185, 189 (1978). And how could it be otherwise? In historical accounts concerned with the white citizen\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d realization of his nation\u2019s majestic core values of liberty and equality, the Black American can only be an inert object\u2014any amelioration of his position is but evidence of others\u2019 moral progress. In 1968, in his Presidential Address, the leader of the Organization of American Historians warned against African Americans\u2019 insistence \u201con visibility, if not overvisibility, in the textbooks,\u201d a project that could \u201cwin little support from true scholarship.\u201d Id. at 218\u201319 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas A. Bailey, The Mythmakers of American History, 55 J. Am. Hist. 5, 7\u20138 (1968)). \u201cThe luckless African-Americans while in slavery were essentially in jail; and we certainly would not write the story of a nation in terms of its prison population.\u201d Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bailey, supra, at 8).[\/footnote] It is in that context that the cheerful,\u00a0 triumphant neo-Whig\u00a0 version\u00a0 of\u00a0 American\u00a0 history\u00a0 emerged.[footnote]Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical <em>Hamilton<\/em>, which opened during the Obama presidency, is like the neo-Whig history in that it emerged in another moment of optimism. It barely mentions slavery, uses actors of color as the Patriot Founders, and casts white actors for the Loyalists and King George. It thereby associates the \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d that the American Patriots fought for with the freedom struggles of Black and brown peoples against white supremacist and colonial regimes. Many of those Patriot Founders, however, owned slaves or otherwise participated in or profited from Black slavery, a vast system of kidnapping and torture and rape. The actual historical figures <em>Hamilton<\/em> depicts knew that slavery was wrong but founded a nation with slavery at its heart anyway. See Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Constitutional Convention: Making a Covenant With Death, <em>in<\/em> Beyond Confederation: Origins of the Constitution and American National Identity 188, 193\u201397 (Richard Beeman, Stephen Botein &amp; Edward C. Carter II eds., 1987). The musical\u2019s innovative casting works an insidious erasure of that history. This was not, of course, the playwright\u2019s intention. There was a poignant moment soon after the transition to the Trump presidency that seemed to highlight that the optimism or, perhaps, the complacency of the Obama years had always been important context supporting the show\u2019s ebullient message. See Christopher Mele &amp; Patrick Healy, \u2018<em>Hamilton<\/em>\u2019 Had Some Unscripted Lines for Pence. Trump Wasn\u2019t Happy., N.Y. Times (Nov. 19, 2016), https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\r\n2016\/11\/19\/us\/mike-pence-hamilton.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). With Vice President Mike Pence in the audience, the cast of <em>Hamilton<\/em> evidently did not feel that the show, by itself, did enough to represent their \u201cAmerican values,\u201d including their stance on the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d of \u201cdiverse America.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] These historians tried to gather a compelling narrative from the mass of information in the past and make it advance sensibly toward their present. This is not a criticism of their work; that is the historian\u2019s craft.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re writing in a different context now.

Project on Sec. &amp; Threats (Aug. 6, 2021), https:\/\/cpost.uchicago.edu\/research\/domestic_extremism\/why_we_cannot_\r\nafford_to_ignore_the_american_insurrectionist_movement\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/42UZ-UBNU] (concluding from a survey that \u201cthe insurrectionist movement is more mainstream, cross-party, and more complex than many people might like to think\u201d).[\/footnote] In this context, it no longer makes sense to celebrate America as exceptional because we have discovered how to engage in politics \u201cwithout resorting to violence.\u201d[footnote]Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 613\u201314.[\/footnote] Instead, it makes more sense to ask: What is the path that led us here?\r\n\r\nThere are more than enough signs, for those looking to find them, that violence has been an integral part of the American system of govern\u00adment from the Founding era. That is because we are the inheritors of not one constitutional tradition from that era but two. One is a constitution-alism of institutions created by text along with a practice of turning to those institutions to resolve political differences.[footnote]See supra notes 16\u201319 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We have been taught to understand that this is the end-all-be-all. But that\u2019s not right.\r\n\r\nWe are also the inheritors of the Founders\u2019 unwritten constitutional tradition. And under the unwritten constitution of their upbringing, the Founders made claims through action, won rights through usage, and maintained rights through uninterrupted custom.[footnote]As I have previously argued, \u201c[H]aving grown up as Britons, and having lost friends and family in a war to defend their rights as such, they\u201d would continue to think \u201cof themselves as the beneficiaries of a constitution of customary right.\u201d Farah Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places, 106 Va. L. Rev. 559, 565 (2020) [hereinafter Peterson, Constitutionalism in Unexpected Places].[\/footnote] This Article demon\u00adstrates that under a constitution thus defined through praxis, violence formed a part of the legal lexicon. It was not just that people at times resorted to violence to get their way; British North Americans belonged to communities that recognized violence as a means of making legal arguments and preserving legal norms.[footnote]These competing traditions are well-represented in the architecture of our Supreme Court building. Text engraved on its architrave proclaims, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law,\u201d while just underneath, the brass doors show King John sealing the Magna Carta following his defeat to the Rebel Barons at Runnymede. Building Features, Sup. Ct. of the U.S., https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/about\/buildingfeatures.aspx [https:\/\/perma.cc\/KL9D-VC4X] (last visited July 26, 2022); Magna Carta, Nat\u2019l Archives, https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/\r\nexhibits\/featured-documents\/magna-carta [https:\/\/perma.cc\/CC8U-NMGH] (last visited July 26, 2022). Each of these architectural elements, both the textual truism and the pictorial origin story, have become a sort of anodyne pap for the first-year law student. But as constitutional philosophy, these sentiments are in opposition. Equal justice, the system of text- and precedent-based law that gives to each claimant the same principled answer, is not compatible with a system that awards rights to those few who win by force of arms. If these elements both belong on the face of the Supreme Court building, it is because of that tension. Together they help to express a contradiction at the core of our legal culture.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Federalists tried to replace this constitution of community con\u00adsensus, of praxis, of action, and of force, with a written constitution. Their accomplishment, the neo-Whig historians taught us (skipping over the Civil War, which was not their period of expertise), was that we would thereafter fight out our controversies at the ballot box or in court.[footnote]See, e.g., Wood, Creation of the American Republic, supra note 10, at 614 (\u201cAmericans had in fact institutionalized and legitimized revolution\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [N]ew knowledge about the nature of government could be converted into concrete form without resorting to violence.\u201d).[\/footnote] A writ-ten constitution was supposed to confine constitutional claimsmaking to text and institutions.[footnote]See id. at 613\u201315.[\/footnote] Neo-Whig historians and their students have described the Founding moment as the triumphant establishment by the era\u2019s elite of this <em>ordered<\/em> system, one so bloodless and rational that we can still discern its outlines and parse its Framers\u2019 intentions by looking at the text they set down.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] But this Article argues that the Federalists were not able to suppress or to fully transform Americans\u2019 constitutionalism of force.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionalism of force endures. Even as our institutional traditions have grown more dominant over the centuries, it is nonetheless impossible to fully account for the ordering of our society or for the interpretation of the textual Constitution without also understanding that violence has at times fueled the Constitution\u2019s evolution and defined the limits of constitutional amendment by more formal means. The Ku Klux Klan\u2019s campaign of terror defined the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments more than its framers\u2019 intentions did,[footnote]See John Patrick Daly, The War After the War: A New History of Construction 3\u20134 (2022) (arguing that the \u201ccomplete triumph of white supremacist military forces in 1877 settled many of the open issues of the legacy of the earlier Civil War,\u201d and \u201cex-Confederate extremists, with their military action,\u201d also \u201ccrippled\u201d each of the Reconstruction Amendments in the South); Steven Hahn, A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration 266 (2003) (observing that \u201c[b]etter than anyone,\u201d the freed slaves in the South \u201cunderstood that the rites of democracy had been built on rituals of violence and suppression directed against them,\u201d and \u201c[j]ust as \u201c[p]aramilitary organization\u201d had been central to slavery, \u201cit remained fundamental to the social and political order of freedom\u201d); id. at 265\u2013313 (discussing the martial efforts Southern Black Americans undertook in order to participate in democracy and the rise of paramilitary organizations like the Klan devoted to suppressing Black participation); see also Eric Foner, The Supreme Court and the History of Reconstruction\u2014and Vice-Versa, 112 Colum. L. Rev. 1585, 1587\u201390, 1592\u201393, 1602\u201303 (2012) (describing how historical writing of Reconstruction, which valorized the Ku Klux Klan, influenced the Supreme Court to limit the scope of the Reconstruction Amendments). See generally Eric Foner, The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution (2019).[\/footnote] a scope formalized after the fact in <em>Plessy<\/em> <em>v<\/em>. <em>Ferguson<\/em>.[footnote]In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 544 (1896), the Court held that \u201c[t]he object\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cwas undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality.\u201d But critical issues, including what the \u201cnature of things\u201d consisted in and whether \u201csocial\u201d equality was a reasonable goal, were decided outside of the courthouse by paramilitary groups.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf America has a constitutional order that has endured since the Founding moment, that order is a blend of text and violence. The Founders\u2019 legitimation of violence is not a point of historical interest that has since been \u201cfixed\u201d and safely resolved. Resort to violence to resolve consti\u00adtutional questions has instead been a recurring theme, one that is not as acute in every era but that resurfaces frequently. When it does, it poses a serious threat to the rule of law system and the institutional tradi\u00adtions we have nurtured and strengthened over the course of our history.\r\n\r\nWe have inherited the Federalists\u2019 failures, and these days we may feel them even more keenly than the Federalists\u2019 many successes. Violent movements have power to change our constitutional order. As a result, we are now in a time as precarious and as open to influence as any of the other key moments in our country\u2019s formation.",
