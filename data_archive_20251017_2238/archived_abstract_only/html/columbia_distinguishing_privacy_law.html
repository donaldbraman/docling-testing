					<div class="content-abstract">
				<p>What distinguishes privacy violations from other harms? This has proven a surprisingly difficult question to answer. For over a century, privacy law scholars labored to define the elusive concept of privacy. Then they gave up. Efforts to distinguish privacy were superseded at the turn of the millennium by a new approach: a taxonomy of privacy problems grounded in social recognition. Privacy law became the field that simply studies whatever courts or scholars talk about as related to privacy.</p>
<p>Decades into privacy as social taxonomy, the field has expanded to encompass a broad range of information-based harms—from consumer manipulation to algorithmic bias—generating many rich insights. Yet this approach has come at a cost. This Essay diagnoses the pathologies of a field that has abandoned defining its core subject matter and offers a research agenda for privacy in the aftermath of social recognition.</p>
<p>Our critique is overdue. It is past time to think anew about exactly what work the concept of privacy is doing in a complex information environment and why a given societal problem—from discrimination to mis information—is worthy of study under a privacy framework. Only then can privacy scholars articulate what we are expert in and participate meaningfully in global policy discussions about how best to govern information-based harms.</p>

<p>Each of these scenarios, and countless others, have been recognized as problems involving “privacy.” Are they? This vibrant, interdisciplinary field with decades of history possesses no real sense of what constitutes a privacy problem and what does not.

 But Solove’s specific rejection of privacy conceptualization in favor of a taxonomic approach continues to exert a profound influence on the shape of contemporary privacy scholarship.

 Unburdened by a need to define privacy, the past two decades have seen a Cambrian explosion in the arguments and issues at the heart of mainstream privacy scholarship.</p>
<p>This Essay argues that the long-dominant social-taxonomic approach to privacy and privacy law is no longer serving the field. There are several important reasons why. First, social recognition alone is not—and never has been—a sufficient criterion for what counts as a privacy problem. Instead of comparing an information-based harm to a set definition of a privacy harm, the taxonomic approach asks whether the right people or institutions—typically courts, public officials, and established scholars—talk about the harm as involving privacy.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 In and of itself, this approach raises critical questions about authority, legitimacy, and whose voices should be heard and valued when it comes to identifying new privacy harms.</p>
<p>The social-taxonomic approach also omits, and arguably impedes, the development of a sophisticated framework for interrogating the tension between the various values under the privacy umbrella. For example, many free speech scholars see privacy as an impediment to self-expression.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Distinguishing privacy from data protection, content moderation, or antidiscrimination law would shed light on the precise goals societies are trying to meet, the range of approaches that exist to meet them, and the institutions best suited to address these issues. The FTC, for example, may be better positioned to address violations of information privacy, whereas the DOJ Civil Rights Division is better versed in antidiscrimination law. But to this day, the European Union has not recognized any American federal agency as a data-protection authority, in part because our information governance goals are imprecise and scattered haphazardly across various institutions and agencies. As a result, only recently have the United States and the European Union agreed on a privacy framework to share data.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 The time has come to leverage this literature in service of a new direction for the field.</p>
<p>The Essay proceeds as follows. Part I traces the efforts of twentieth-century privacy scholars to define our subject matter, culminating in Solove’s intervention in the early 2000s, and acknowledges the generative role of privacy’s taxonomy paradigm. Part II argues that social recognition has always been a flawed means by which to distinguish privacy and that privacy as taxonomy stands in the way of identifying, reconciling, and distinguishing privacy harms in a diverse and complex information environment. Section II.A discusses information-based harms that privacy law was late to recognize, such as information-based discrimination and algorithmic manipulation. Section II.B discusses unresolved tensions between and among privacy and other values.</p>
<p>Part III outlines a post-taxonomy research agenda for privacy law, one that decouples classification from social recognition, foregrounds the role of reflexivity, and begins to answer the deep question of just what work privacy is doing in the context of information-based harms. Misinformation, hate speech, bias, data sovereignty, labor extraction, and many other contemporary concerns implicate or involve privacy but sound in different values altogether. By uncritically broadening the concept of privacy, most Americans are missing out on a global conversation around data protection, information governance, and harm mitigation. Only by distinguishing privacy can privacy law reach its full potential as a discipline and a body of law.</p>

Why? No one can say.\r\n\r\nThroughout the twentieth century, scholars sought to define and distinguish the concept of privacy. A parade of articles and books, from The Right to Privacy onward, offered varying definitions for this elusive idea.[footnote]See infra Part I.[\/footnote] Privacy amounts to a right \u201cto be let alone,\u201d[footnote]Samuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 195 (1890) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888)).[\/footnote] these works argued, or \u201cthe control we have over information about ourselves.\u201d[footnote]Charles Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L.J. 475, 482 (1968) (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Privacy involves access to the self or self-determination.[footnote]See, e.g., Anita L. Allen, Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society 13\u201317 (1988) [hereinafter Allen, Uneasy Access] (\u201c[P]ersonal privacy is a condition of inaccessibility of the person, his or her mental states, or information about the person to the senses or surveillance devices of others.\u201d); Edward J. Eberle, Human Dignity, Privacy, and Personality in German and American Constitutional Law, 1997 Utah L. Rev. 963, 1000 (defining \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d as a conception of privacy that seeks to \u201cpreserve the integrity of human personality against the onslaught of the technological age and of prying eyes\u201d); Ruth Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law, 89 Yale L.J. 421, 423 (1980) [hereinafter Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law] (arguing that privacy \u201cis related to our concern over our accessibility to others\u201d).[\/footnote] Over one hundred years of debating solitude[footnote]See Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gregory Rabassa trans., Harper & Row 1970).[\/footnote] yielded no universally agreed-upon definition. But that did little to deter privacy scholars from trying.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, a new voice arose that would come to shape the field of American privacy scholarship for decades. In a series of articles and books, Professor Daniel J. Solove dismissed attempts to define privacy as invariably over- or underinclusive.[footnote]See Daniel J. Solove, Understanding Privacy 8 (2008) (criticizing privacy theories that characterize privacy as a \u201cunitary concept with a uniform value that is unvarying across different situations\u201d and explaining that the \u201cattempt to locate the \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018core\u2019 characteristics of privacy has led to failure\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 1087, 1124 (2002) [hereinafter Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy] (arguing that settling on any of the six common conceptions of privacy described in the article would result in \u201ceither a reductive or an overly broad account of privacy\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, A Taxonomy of Privacy, 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, 485\u201386 (2006) [hereinafter Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy] (claiming that attempts to find a single essence of privacy are usually \u201ctoo broad and vague\u201d).[\/footnote] Embracing a pragmatism similar to that of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,[footnote]See Louis Menand, The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America 339\u201347 (2001) (describing Holmes\u2019s theory of the law, which claimed that decisions are fundamentally dictated by experience, not formal doctrinal logic).[\/footnote] Solove exhorted the field to abandon the quixotic quest to attach a single definition to privacy.[footnote]See Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy, supra note 14, at 481\u201382 (arguing for a framework to evaluate privacy issues based on specific harmful activities instead of defaulting to a single definition that is too vague to be useful for effective policymaking and lawmaking).[\/footnote] In its place, Solove offered a taxonomy of \u201cthe specific activities that pose privacy problems,\u201d a loosely correlated set of concerns and concepts that have come to be associated with privacy in its many forms.[footnote]Id. at 482, 489\u201391.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe taxonomizing of privacy was not without precedent. Professor William Prosser famously distilled four privacy torts from decades of case law,[footnote]See William L. Prosser, Privacy, 48 Calif. L. Rev. 383, 389 (1960) (proposing \u201cfour distinct kinds of invasion of four different interests of the plaintiff, which are tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each rep-resents an interference with the right of the plaintiff . . . \u2018to be let alone\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888))).[\/footnote] and Professor Alan Westin compiled a taxonomy of privacy attitudes.[footnote]See Alan F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom 31\u201332 (1967) (identifying four psychological conditions or states of individual privacy).[\/footnote] Nor has the taxonomy of privacy entirely evaded critique.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey Bellin, Pure Privacy, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 463, 465\u201368 (2021) (listing the drawbacks of not being able to define the term \u201cprivacy\u201d); M. Ryan Calo, The Boundaries of Privacy Harm, 86 Ind. L.J. 1131, 1140\u201342 (2011) [hereinafter Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm] (highlighting the limitations of the taxonomic approach and the pressing need for principles that delimit privacy harm); David E. Pozen, Privacy\u2013Privacy Tradeoffs, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221, 226\u201327 (2016) (pointing out how the \u201ccapaciousness\u201d of Solove\u2019s taxonomic approach \u201cexacerbates the dilemma of privacy-privacy tradeoffs\u201d).[\/footnote] But Solove\u2019s specific rejection of privacy conceptualization in favor of a taxonomic approach continues to exert a profound influence on the shape of contemporary privacy scholarship. As Professor Woodrow Hartzog recently explained, abandoning definition in favor of taxonomy helped breathe new life into the field.[footnote]See Woodrow Hartzog, What Is Privacy? That\u2019s the Wrong Question, 88 U. Chi. L.

There are several important reasons why. First, social recognition alone is not\u2014and never has been\u2014a sufficient criterion for what counts as a privacy problem. Instead of comparing an information-based harm to a set definition of a privacy harm, the taxonomic approach asks whether the right people or institutions\u2014typically courts, public officials, and established scholars\u2014talk about the harm as involving privacy.[footnote]See Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm, supra note 20, at 1141 (\u201cSolove\u2019s criteria for inclusion involve recognition by the right sorts of authorities.\u201d).[\/footnote] In and of itself, this approach raises critical questions about authority, legitimacy, and whose voices should be heard and valued when it comes to identifying new privacy harms.\r\n\r\nThe social-taxonomic approach also omits, and arguably impedes, the development of a sophisticated framework for interrogating the tension between the various values under the privacy umbrella. For example, many free speech scholars see privacy as an impediment to self-expression.[footnote]See, e.g., Solveig Singleton, Privacy Versus the First Amendment: A Skeptical Approach, 11 Fordham Intell.

Why? No one can say.\r\n\r\nThroughout the twentieth century, scholars sought to define and distinguish the concept of privacy. A parade of articles and books, from The Right to Privacy onward, offered varying definitions for this elusive idea.[footnote]See infra Part I.[\/footnote] Privacy amounts to a right \u201cto be let alone,\u201d[footnote]Samuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 195 (1890) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888)).[\/footnote] these works argued, or \u201cthe control we have over information about ourselves.\u201d[footnote]Charles Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L.J. 475, 482 (1968) (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Privacy involves access to the self or self-determination.[footnote]See, e.g., Anita L. Allen, Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society 13\u201317 (1988) [hereinafter Allen, Uneasy Access] (\u201c[P]ersonal privacy is a condition of inaccessibility of the person, his or her mental states, or information about the person to the senses or surveillance devices of others.\u201d); Edward J. Eberle, Human Dignity, Privacy, and Personality in German and American Constitutional Law, 1997 Utah L. Rev. 963, 1000 (defining \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d as a conception of privacy that seeks to \u201cpreserve the integrity of human personality against the onslaught of the technological age and of prying eyes\u201d); Ruth Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law, 89 Yale L.J. 421, 423 (1980) [hereinafter Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law] (arguing that privacy \u201cis related to our concern over our accessibility to others\u201d).[\/footnote] Over one hundred years of debating solitude[footnote]See Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gregory Rabassa trans., Harper & Row 1970).[\/footnote] yielded no universally agreed-upon definition. But that did little to deter privacy scholars from trying.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, a new voice arose that would come to shape the field of American privacy scholarship for decades. In a series of articles and books, Professor Daniel J. Solove dismissed attempts to define privacy as invariably over- or underinclusive.[footnote]See Daniel J. Solove, Understanding Privacy 8 (2008) (criticizing privacy theories that characterize privacy as a \u201cunitary concept with a uniform value that is unvarying across different situations\u201d and explaining that the \u201cattempt to locate the \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018core\u2019 characteristics of privacy has led to failure\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 1087, 1124 (2002) [hereinafter Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy] (arguing that settling on any of the six common conceptions of privacy described in the article would result in \u201ceither a reductive or an overly broad account of privacy\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, A Taxonomy of Privacy, 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, 485\u201386 (2006) [hereinafter Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy] (claiming that attempts to find a single essence of privacy are usually \u201ctoo broad and vague\u201d).[\/footnote] Embracing a pragmatism similar to that of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,[footnote]See Louis Menand, The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America 339\u201347 (2001) (describing Holmes\u2019s theory of the law, which claimed that decisions are fundamentally dictated by experience, not formal doctrinal logic).[\/footnote] Solove exhorted the field to abandon the quixotic quest to attach a single definition to privacy.[footnote]See Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy, supra note 14, at 481\u201382 (arguing for a framework to evaluate privacy issues based on specific harmful activities instead of defaulting to a single definition that is too vague to be useful for effective policymaking and lawmaking).[\/footnote] In its place, Solove offered a taxonomy of \u201cthe specific activities that pose privacy problems,\u201d a loosely correlated set of concerns and concepts that have come to be associated with privacy in its many forms.[footnote]Id. at 482, 489\u201391.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe taxonomizing of privacy was not without precedent. Professor William Prosser famously distilled four privacy torts from decades of case law,[footnote]See William L. Prosser, Privacy, 48 Calif. L. Rev. 383, 389 (1960) (proposing \u201cfour distinct kinds of invasion of four different interests of the plaintiff, which are tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each rep-resents an interference with the right of the plaintiff . . . \u2018to be let alone\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888))).[\/footnote] and Professor Alan Westin compiled a taxonomy of privacy attitudes.[footnote]See Alan F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom 31\u201332 (1967) (identifying four psychological conditions or states of individual privacy).[\/footnote] Nor has the taxonomy of privacy entirely evaded critique.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey Bellin, Pure Privacy, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 463, 465\u201368 (2021) (listing the drawbacks of not being able to define the term \u201cprivacy\u201d); M. Ryan Calo, The Boundaries of Privacy Harm, 86 Ind. L.J. 1131, 1140\u201342 (2011) [hereinafter Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm] (highlighting the limitations of the taxonomic approach and the pressing need for principles that delimit privacy harm); David E. Pozen, Privacy\u2013Privacy Tradeoffs, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221, 226\u201327 (2016) (pointing out how the \u201ccapaciousness\u201d of Solove\u2019s taxonomic approach \u201cexacerbates the dilemma of privacy-privacy tradeoffs\u201d).[\/footnote] But Solove\u2019s specific rejection of privacy conceptualization in favor of a taxonomic approach continues to exert a profound influence on the shape of contemporary privacy scholarship. As Professor Woodrow Hartzog recently explained, abandoning definition in favor of taxonomy helped breathe new life into the field.[footnote]See Woodrow Hartzog, What Is Privacy? That\u2019s the Wrong Question, 88 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1677, 1687 (2021) (\u201cBy getting us past the threshold question of what privacy is, Solove\u2019s work provides room for scholars and lawmakers to tackle bigger phenomena . . . .\u201d).[\/footnote] Unburdened by a need to define privacy, the past two decades have seen a Cambrian explosion in the arguments and issues at the heart of mainstream privacy scholarship.\r\n\r\nThis Essay argues that the long-dominant social-taxonomic approach to privacy and privacy law is no longer serving the field.

This vibrant, interdisciplinary field with decades of history possesses no real sense of what constitutes a privacy problem and what does not. Though these scenarios implicate different values and arise from different contexts, none would be out of place at a privacy law conference. Yet other types of information-based harms\u2014TikTok users sharing a fake screenshot of a nonexistent CNN headline suggesting that climate change is seasonal,[footnote]Tiffany Hsu, Worries Grow that TikTok Is New Home for Manipulated Video and Photos, N.Y. Times (Nov. 4, 2022), https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/04\/technology\/\u200ctiktok-deepfakes-disinformation.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] for example\u2014would be out of place. Why? No one can say.\r\n\r\nThroughout the twentieth century, scholars sought to define and distinguish the concept of privacy. A parade of articles and books, from The Right to Privacy onward, offered varying definitions for this elusive idea.[footnote]See infra Part I.[\/footnote] Privacy amounts to a right \u201cto be let alone,\u201d[footnote]Samuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 195 (1890) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888)).[\/footnote] these works argued, or \u201cthe control we have over information about ourselves.\u201d[footnote]Charles Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L.J. 475, 482 (1968) (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Privacy involves access to the self or self-determination.[footnote]See, e.g., Anita L. Allen, Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society 13\u201317 (1988) [hereinafter Allen, Uneasy Access] (\u201c[P]ersonal privacy is a condition of inaccessibility of the person, his or her mental states, or information about the person to the senses or surveillance devices of others.\u201d); Edward J. Eberle, Human Dignity, Privacy, and Personality in German and American Constitutional Law, 1997 Utah L. Rev. 963, 1000 (defining \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d as a conception of privacy that seeks to \u201cpreserve the integrity of human personality against the onslaught of the technological age and of prying eyes\u201d); Ruth Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law, 89 Yale L.J. 421, 423 (1980) [hereinafter Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law] (arguing that privacy \u201cis related to our concern over our accessibility to others\u201d).[\/footnote] Over one hundred years of debating solitude[footnote]See Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gregory Rabassa trans., Harper & Row 1970).[\/footnote] yielded no universally agreed-upon definition. But that did little to deter privacy scholars from trying.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, a new voice arose that would come to shape the field of American privacy scholarship for decades. In a series of articles and books, Professor Daniel J. Solove dismissed attempts to define privacy as invariably over- or underinclusive.[footnote]See Daniel J. Solove, Understanding Privacy 8 (2008) (criticizing privacy theories that characterize privacy as a \u201cunitary concept with a uniform value that is unvarying across different situations\u201d and explaining that the \u201cattempt to locate the \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018core\u2019 characteristics of privacy has led to failure\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 1087, 1124 (2002) [hereinafter Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy] (arguing that settling on any of the six common conceptions of privacy described in the article would result in \u201ceither a reductive or an overly broad account of privacy\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, A Taxonomy of Privacy, 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, 485\u201386 (2006) [hereinafter Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy] (claiming that attempts to find a single essence of privacy are usually \u201ctoo broad and vague\u201d).[\/footnote] Embracing a pragmatism similar to that of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,[footnote]See Louis Menand, The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America 339\u201347 (2001) (describing Holmes\u2019s theory of the law, which claimed that decisions are fundamentally dictated by experience, not formal doctrinal logic).[\/footnote] Solove exhorted the field to abandon the quixotic quest to attach a single definition to privacy.[footnote]See Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy, supra note 14, at 481\u201382 (arguing for a framework to evaluate privacy issues based on specific harmful activities instead of defaulting to a single definition that is too vague to be useful for effective policymaking and lawmaking).[\/footnote] In its place, Solove offered a taxonomy of \u201cthe specific activities that pose privacy problems,\u201d a loosely correlated set of concerns and concepts that have come to be associated with privacy in its many forms.[footnote]Id. at 482, 489\u201391.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe taxonomizing of privacy was not without precedent. Professor William Prosser famously distilled four privacy torts from decades of case law,[footnote]See William L. Prosser, Privacy, 48 Calif. L. Rev. 383, 389 (1960) (proposing \u201cfour distinct kinds of invasion of four different interests of the plaintiff, which are tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each rep-resents an interference with the right of the plaintiff . . . \u2018to be let alone\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888))).[\/footnote] and Professor Alan Westin compiled a taxonomy of privacy attitudes.[footnote]See Alan F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom 31\u201332 (1967) (identifying four psychological conditions or states of individual privacy).[\/footnote] Nor has the taxonomy of privacy entirely evaded critique.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey Bellin, Pure Privacy, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 463, 465\u201368 (2021) (listing the drawbacks of not being able to define the term \u201cprivacy\u201d); M. Ryan Calo, The Boundaries of Privacy Harm, 86 Ind. L.J. 1131, 1140\u201342 (2011) [hereinafter Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm] (highlighting the limitations of the taxonomic approach and the pressing need for principles that delimit privacy harm); David E. Pozen, Privacy\u2013Privacy Tradeoffs, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221, 226\u201327 (2016) (pointing out how the \u201ccapaciousness\u201d of Solove\u2019s taxonomic approach \u201cexacerbates the dilemma of privacy-privacy tradeoffs\u201d).[\/footnote] But Solove\u2019s specific rejection of privacy conceptualization in favor of a taxonomic approach continues to exert a profound influence on the shape of contemporary privacy scholarship. As Professor Woodrow Hartzog recently explained, abandoning definition in favor of taxonomy helped breathe new life into the field.[footnote]See Woodrow Hartzog, What Is Privacy? That\u2019s the Wrong Question, 88 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1677, 1687 (2021) (\u201cBy getting us past the threshold question of what privacy is, Solove\u2019s work provides room for scholars and lawmakers to tackle bigger phenomena . . . .\u201d).[\/footnote] Unburdened by a need to define privacy, the past two decades have seen a Cambrian explosion in the arguments and issues at the heart of mainstream privacy scholarship.\r\n\r\nThis Essay argues that the long-dominant social-taxonomic approach to privacy and privacy law is no longer serving the field. There are several important reasons why. First, social recognition alone is not\u2014and never has been\u2014a sufficient criterion for what counts as a privacy problem. Instead of comparing an information-based harm to a set definition of a privacy harm, the taxonomic approach asks whether the right people or institutions\u2014typically courts, public officials, and established scholars\u2014talk about the harm as involving privacy.[footnote]See Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm, supra note 20, at 1141 (\u201cSolove\u2019s criteria for inclusion involve recognition by the right sorts of authorities.\u201d).[\/footnote] In and of itself, this approach raises critical questions about authority, legitimacy, and whose voices should be heard and valued when it comes to identifying new privacy harms.\r\n\r\nThe social-taxonomic approach also omits, and arguably impedes, the development of a sophisticated framework for interrogating the tension between the various values under the privacy umbrella. For example, many free speech scholars see privacy as an impediment to self-expression.[footnote]See, e.g., Solveig Singleton, Privacy Versus the First Amendment: A Skeptical Approach, 11 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L.J. 97, 97 (2000) (\u201cThe courts should think twice before sacrificing the mature law of free speech to the less coherent concerns about privacy.\u201d); Eugene Volokh, Freedom of Speech and Information Privacy: The Troubling Implications of a Right to Stop People From Speaking About You, 52 Stan. L. Rev. 1049, 1051 (2000) (\u201cWhile privacy protection secured by contract is constitutionally sound, broader information privacy rules are not easily defensible under existing free speech law.\u201d).[\/footnote] Other scholars in the critical tradition have explored how privacy is deployed as cover for subordination.[footnote]See, e.g., Catharine A. MacKinnon, Privacy v. Equality: Beyond <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>, in Feminism Unmodified 93, 102 (1987) [hereinafter MacKinnon, Privacy v. Equality] (describing the right to privacy as \u201ca right of men \u2018to be let alone\u2019 to oppress women one at a time\u201d (footnote omitted) (quoting Warren & Brandeis, supra note 10, at 205)); Lucinda M. Finley, Transcending Equality Theory: A Way Out of the Maternity and the Workplace Debate, 86 Colum. L. Rev. 1118, 1119 (1986) (\u201cThe notion that the world of remunerative work and the world of home\u2014or the realms of production and reproduction\u2014are separate, has fostered the economic and social subordination of women . . . .\u201d); Elizabeth M. Schneider, The Violence of Privacy, 23 Conn. L. Rev. 973, 975 (1991) [hereinafter Schneider, Violence of Privacy] (\u201cThe notion of marital privacy has been a source of oppression to battered women and has helped to maintain women\u2019s subordination within the family.\u201d).[\/footnote] And a decade or more of work in algorithmic accountability illustrates the tension between privacy and antidiscrimination or fairness.[footnote]See, e.g., Roger Allan Ford & W. Nicholson Price II, Privacy and Accountability in Black-Box Medicine, 23 Mich. Telecomms. & Tech. L. Rev. 1, 4 (2016) (\u201cThe solution to the accountability problem is to validate black-box models, but that requires access to more information, which can exacerbate the privacy problem. And the solution to the privacy problem is to limit [information] . . . but that can make it harder to validate models and easier to hide . . . problems.\u201d); Finale Doshi-Velez & Mason Kortz, Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation 10 (2017), https:\/\/dash.harvard.edu\/bitstream\/\u200chandle\/1\/34372584\/2017-11_aiexplainability-1.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/E7NE-3E9C] (unpublished working paper) (\u201cAI systems do not automatically store information about their decisions. . . . [U]nlike human decision-makers, AI systems can delete information to optimize their data storage and protect privacy. However, an AI system designed this way would not be able to generate ex post explanations the way a human can.\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet this expansive, criteria-free approach to privacy has come to fold in information-based threats to self-expression, antisubordination, and fairness as core privacy concerns.[footnote]See infra section I.C.[\/footnote] The result is a proliferation of vexing \u201cprivacy\u2013privacy tradeoffs\u201d[footnote]See Pozen, supra note 20, at 222.[\/footnote] with little hope of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nSituating privacy law within the broader structure of information-based power has become a critical task for scholars and policymakers alike. American privacy law scholarship has yet to even reconcile the basic distinction between privacy and data protection,[footnote]See infra notes 285\u2013294 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] let alone the new modes of information governance that European and other societies are exploring today.[footnote]See infra notes 295\u2013300 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Distinguishing privacy from data protection, content moderation, or antidiscrimination law would shed light on the precise goals societies are trying to meet, the range of approaches that exist to meet them, and the institutions best suited to address these issues. The FTC, for example, may be better positioned to address violations of information privacy, whereas the DOJ Civil Rights Division is better versed in antidiscrimination law. But to this day, the European Union has not recognized any American federal agency as a data-protection authority, in part because our information governance goals are imprecise and scattered haphazardly across various institutions and agencies. As a result, only recently have the United States and the European Union agreed on a privacy framework to share data.[footnote]See 2023 O.J. (C 4745).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that we try to understand what work the concept of privacy is doing in today\u2019s complex information environment. As it happens, some of the leading and emerging lights in privacy law scholarship are beginning to disentangle privacy from other information-based values, reminding the field just what we are experts in.[footnote]See, e.g., Julie E. Cohen, What Privacy Is For, 126 Harv. L. Rev. 1904, 1905 (2013) [hereinafter Cohen, What Privacy Is For] (arguing that privacy is not a legal protection for the liberal self but instead a fundamental tool for protecting \u201cthe situated practices of boundary management through which the capacity for self-determination develops\u201d); Cynthia Dwork & Deirdre K. Mulligan, It\u2019s Not Privacy, and It\u2019s Not Fair, 66 Stan. L. Rev. Online 35, 36 (2013), https:\/\/review.law.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2016\/\u200c08\/DworkMullliganSLR.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/Q8JA-463Q] (\u201cRegrettably, privacy controls and increased transparency fail to address concerns with the classifications and segmentation produced by big data analysis.\u201d); Paul Schwartz, Data Processing and Government Administration: The Failure of the American Legal Response to the Computer, 43 Hastings L.J. 1321, 1343\u201352 (1992) [hereinafter Schwartz, Data Processing] (discussing the weaknesses of the \u201cprivacy\u201d paradigm and proposing instead to talk about bureaucratic justice and human autonomy); Salome\u0301 Viljoen, A Relational Theory of Data Governance, 131 Yale L.J. 573, 578 (2021) (critiquing privacy law\u2019s individualism, which fails to address data\u2019s population-level relational effects); Tal Z. Zarsky, Privacy and Manipulation in the Digital Age, 20 Theoretical Inquiries L. 157, 161\u201368 (2019) [hereinafter Zarsky, Privacy and Manipulation] (suggesting that manipulation-based arguments are preferable to privacy theories, which are plagued with substantial theoretical shortcomings and pitfalls).[\/footnote] The time has come to leverage this literature in service of a new direction for the field.\r\n\r\nThe Essay proceeds as follows. Part I traces the efforts of twentieth-century privacy scholars to define our subject matter, culminating in Solove\u2019s intervention in the early 2000s, and acknowledges the generative role of privacy\u2019s taxonomy paradigm. Part II argues that social recognition has always been a flawed means by which to distinguish privacy and that privacy as taxonomy stands in the way of identifying, reconciling, and distinguishing privacy harms in a diverse and complex information environment. Section II.A discusses information-based harms that privacy law was late to recognize, such as information-based discrimination and algorithmic manipulation. Section II.B discusses unresolved tensions between and among privacy and other values.\r\n\r\nPart III outlines a post-taxonomy research agenda for privacy law, one that decouples classification from social recognition, foregrounds the role of reflexivity, and begins to answer the deep question of just what work privacy is doing in the context of information-based harms. Misinformation, hate speech, bias, data sovereignty, labor extraction, and many other contemporary concerns implicate or involve privacy but sound in different values altogether. By uncritically broadening the concept of privacy, most Americans are missing out on a global conversation around data protection, information governance, and harm mitigation.

This vibrant, interdisciplinary field with decades of history possesses no real sense of what constitutes a privacy problem and what does not.

Why? No one can say.\r\n\r\nThroughout the twentieth century, scholars sought to define and distinguish the concept of privacy. A parade of articles and books, from The Right to Privacy onward, offered varying definitions for this elusive idea.[footnote]See infra Part I.[\/footnote] Privacy amounts to a right \u201cto be let alone,\u201d[footnote]Samuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 195 (1890) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888)).[\/footnote] these works argued, or \u201cthe control we have over information about ourselves.\u201d[footnote]Charles Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L.J. 475, 482 (1968) (emphasis omitted).[\/footnote] Privacy involves access to the self or self-determination.[footnote]See, e.g., Anita L. Allen, Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society 13\u201317 (1988) [hereinafter Allen, Uneasy Access] (\u201c[P]ersonal privacy is a condition of inaccessibility of the person, his or her mental states, or information about the person to the senses or surveillance devices of others.\u201d); Edward J. Eberle, Human Dignity, Privacy, and Personality in German and American Constitutional Law, 1997 Utah L. Rev. 963, 1000 (defining \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d as a conception of privacy that seeks to \u201cpreserve the integrity of human personality against the onslaught of the technological age and of prying eyes\u201d); Ruth Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law, 89 Yale L.J. 421, 423 (1980) [hereinafter Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law] (arguing that privacy \u201cis related to our concern over our accessibility to others\u201d).[\/footnote] Over one hundred years of debating solitude[footnote]See Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gregory Rabassa trans., Harper & Row 1970).[\/footnote] yielded no universally agreed-upon definition. But that did little to deter privacy scholars from trying.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, a new voice arose that would come to shape the field of American privacy scholarship for decades. In a series of articles and books, Professor Daniel J. Solove dismissed attempts to define privacy as invariably over- or underinclusive.[footnote]See Daniel J. Solove, Understanding Privacy 8 (2008) (criticizing privacy theories that characterize privacy as a \u201cunitary concept with a uniform value that is unvarying across different situations\u201d and explaining that the \u201cattempt to locate the \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018core\u2019 characteristics of privacy has led to failure\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 1087, 1124 (2002) [hereinafter Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy] (arguing that settling on any of the six common conceptions of privacy described in the article would result in \u201ceither a reductive or an overly broad account of privacy\u201d); Daniel J. Solove, A Taxonomy of Privacy, 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, 485\u201386 (2006) [hereinafter Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy] (claiming that attempts to find a single essence of privacy are usually \u201ctoo broad and vague\u201d).[\/footnote] Embracing a pragmatism similar to that of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,[footnote]See Louis Menand, The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America 339\u201347 (2001) (describing Holmes\u2019s theory of the law, which claimed that decisions are fundamentally dictated by experience, not formal doctrinal logic).[\/footnote] Solove exhorted the field to abandon the quixotic quest to attach a single definition to privacy.[footnote]See Solove, Taxonomy of Privacy, supra note 14, at 481\u201382 (arguing for a framework to evaluate privacy issues based on specific harmful activities instead of defaulting to a single definition that is too vague to be useful for effective policymaking and lawmaking).[\/footnote] In its place, Solove offered a taxonomy of \u201cthe specific activities that pose privacy problems,\u201d a loosely correlated set of concerns and concepts that have come to be associated with privacy in its many forms.[footnote]Id. at 482, 489\u201391.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe taxonomizing of privacy was not without precedent. Professor William Prosser famously distilled four privacy torts from decades of case law,[footnote]See William L. Prosser, Privacy, 48 Calif. L. Rev. 383, 389 (1960) (proposing \u201cfour distinct kinds of invasion of four different interests of the plaintiff, which are tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each rep-resents an interference with the right of the plaintiff . . . \u2018to be let alone\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract 29 (2d ed. 1888))).[\/footnote] and Professor Alan Westin compiled a taxonomy of privacy attitudes.[footnote]See Alan F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom 31\u201332 (1967) (identifying four psychological conditions or states of individual privacy).[\/footnote] Nor has the taxonomy of privacy entirely evaded critique.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey Bellin, Pure Privacy, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 463, 465\u201368 (2021) (listing the drawbacks of not being able to define the term \u201cprivacy\u201d); M. Ryan Calo, The Boundaries of Privacy Harm, 86 Ind. L.J. 1131, 1140\u201342 (2011) [hereinafter Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm] (highlighting the limitations of the taxonomic approach and the pressing need for principles that delimit privacy harm); David E. Pozen, Privacy\u2013Privacy Tradeoffs, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221, 226\u201327 (2016) (pointing out how the \u201ccapaciousness\u201d of Solove\u2019s taxonomic approach \u201cexacerbates the dilemma of privacy-privacy tradeoffs\u201d).[\/footnote] But Solove\u2019s specific rejection of privacy conceptualization in favor of a taxonomic approach continues to exert a profound influence on the shape of contemporary privacy scholarship. As Professor Woodrow Hartzog recently explained, abandoning definition in favor of taxonomy helped breathe new life into the field.[footnote]See Woodrow Hartzog, What Is Privacy? That\u2019s the Wrong Question, 88 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1677, 1687 (2021) (\u201cBy getting us past the threshold question of what privacy is, Solove\u2019s work provides room for scholars and lawmakers to tackle bigger phenomena . . . .\u201d).[\/footnote] Unburdened by a need to define privacy, the past two decades have seen a Cambrian explosion in the arguments and issues at the heart of mainstream privacy scholarship.\r\n\r\nThis Essay argues that the long-dominant social-taxonomic approach to privacy and privacy law is no longer serving the field. There are several important reasons why. First, social recognition alone is not\u2014and never has been\u2014a sufficient criterion for what counts as a privacy problem. Instead of comparing an information-based harm to a set definition of a privacy harm, the taxonomic approach asks whether the right people or institutions\u2014typically courts, public officials, and established scholars\u2014talk about the harm as involving privacy.[footnote]See Calo, Boundaries of Privacy Harm, supra note 20, at 1141 (\u201cSolove\u2019s criteria for inclusion involve recognition by the right sorts of authorities.\u201d).[\/footnote] In and of itself, this approach raises critical questions about authority, legitimacy, and whose voices should be heard and valued when it comes to identifying new privacy harms.\r\n\r\nThe social-taxonomic approach also omits, and arguably impedes, the development of a sophisticated framework for interrogating the tension between the various values under the privacy umbrella. For example, many free speech scholars see privacy as an impediment to self-expression.[footnote]See, e.g., Solveig Singleton, Privacy Versus the First Amendment: A Skeptical Approach, 11 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L.J. 97, 97 (2000) (\u201cThe courts should think twice before sacrificing the mature law of free speech to the less coherent concerns about privacy.\u201d); Eugene Volokh, Freedom of Speech and Information Privacy: The Troubling Implications of a Right to Stop People From Speaking About You, 52 Stan. L. Rev. 1049, 1051 (2000) (\u201cWhile privacy protection secured by contract is constitutionally sound, broader information privacy rules are not easily defensible under existing free speech law.\u201d).[\/footnote] Other scholars in the critical tradition have explored how privacy is deployed as cover for subordination.[footnote]See, e.g., Catharine A. MacKinnon, Privacy v. Equality: Beyond <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>, in Feminism Unmodified 93, 102 (1987) [hereinafter MacKinnon, Privacy v. Equality] (describing the right to privacy as \u201ca right of men \u2018to be let alone\u2019 to oppress women one at a time\u201d (footnote omitted) (quoting Warren & Brandeis, supra note 10, at 205)); Lucinda M. Finley, Transcending Equality Theory: A Way Out of the Maternity and the Workplace Debate, 86 Colum. L. Rev. 1118, 1119 (1986) (\u201cThe notion that the world of remunerative work and the world of home\u2014or the realms of production and reproduction\u2014are separate, has fostered the economic and social subordination of women . . . .\u201d); Elizabeth M. Schneider, The Violence of Privacy, 23 Conn. L. Rev. 973, 975 (1991) [hereinafter Schneider, Violence of Privacy] (\u201cThe notion of marital privacy has been a source of oppression to battered women and has helped to maintain women\u2019s subordination within the family.\u201d).[\/footnote] And a decade or more of work in algorithmic accountability illustrates the tension between privacy and antidiscrimination or fairness.[footnote]See, e.g., Roger Allan Ford & W. Nicholson Price II, Privacy and Accountability in Black-Box Medicine, 23 Mich. Telecomms. & Tech. L. Rev. 1, 4 (2016) (\u201cThe solution to the accountability problem is to validate black-box models, but that requires access to more information, which can exacerbate the privacy problem. And the solution to the privacy problem is to limit [information] . . . but that can make it harder to validate models and easier to hide . . . problems.\u201d); Finale Doshi-Velez & Mason Kortz, Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation 10 (2017), https:\/\/dash.harvard.edu\/bitstream\/\u200chandle\/1\/34372584\/2017-11_aiexplainability-1.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/E7NE-3E9C] (unpublished working paper) (\u201cAI systems do not automatically store information about their decisions. . . . [U]nlike human decision-makers, AI systems can delete information to optimize their data storage and protect privacy. However, an AI system designed this way would not be able to generate ex post explanations the way a human can.\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet this expansive, criteria-free approach to privacy has come to fold in information-based threats to self-expression, antisubordination, and fairness as core privacy concerns.[footnote]See infra section I.C.[\/footnote] The result is a proliferation of vexing \u201cprivacy\u2013privacy tradeoffs\u201d[footnote]See Pozen, supra note 20, at 222.[\/footnote] with little hope of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nSituating privacy law within the broader structure of information-based power has become a critical task for scholars and policymakers alike. American privacy law scholarship has yet to even reconcile the basic distinction between privacy and data protection,[footnote]See infra notes 285\u2013294 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] let alone the new modes of information governance that European and other societies are exploring today.[footnote]See infra notes 295\u2013300 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Distinguishing privacy from data protection, content moderation, or antidiscrimination law would shed light on the precise goals societies are trying to meet, the range of approaches that exist to meet them, and the institutions best suited to address these issues. The FTC, for example, may be better positioned to address violations of information privacy, whereas the DOJ Civil Rights Division is better versed in antidiscrimination law. But to this day, the European Union has not recognized any American federal agency as a data-protection authority, in part because our information governance goals are imprecise and scattered haphazardly across various institutions and agencies. As a result, only recently have the United States and the European Union agreed on a privacy framework to share data.[footnote]See 2023 O.J. (C 4745).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that we try to understand what work the concept of privacy is doing in today\u2019s complex information environment. As it happens, some of the leading and emerging lights in privacy law scholarship are beginning to disentangle privacy from other information-based values, reminding the field just what we are experts in.[footnote]See, e.g., Julie E. Cohen, What Privacy Is For, 126 Harv. L. Rev. 1904, 1905 (2013) [hereinafter Cohen, What Privacy Is For] (arguing that privacy is not a legal protection for the liberal self but instead a fundamental tool for protecting \u201cthe situated practices of boundary management through which the capacity for self-determination develops\u201d); Cynthia Dwork & Deirdre K. Mulligan, It\u2019s Not Privacy, and It\u2019s Not Fair, 66 Stan. L. Rev. Online 35, 36 (2013), https:\/\/review.law.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2016\/\u200c08\/DworkMullliganSLR.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/Q8JA-463Q] (\u201cRegrettably, privacy controls and increased transparency fail to address concerns with the classifications and segmentation produced by big data analysis.\u201d); Paul Schwartz, Data Processing and Government Administration: The Failure of the American Legal Response to the Computer, 43 Hastings L.J. 1321, 1343\u201352 (1992) [hereinafter Schwartz, Data Processing] (discussing the weaknesses of the \u201cprivacy\u201d paradigm and proposing instead to talk about bureaucratic justice and human autonomy); Salome\u0301 Viljoen, A Relational Theory of Data Governance, 131 Yale L.J. 573, 578 (2021) (critiquing privacy law\u2019s individualism, which fails to address data\u2019s population-level relational effects); Tal Z. Zarsky, Privacy and Manipulation in the Digital Age, 20 Theoretical Inquiries L. 157, 161\u201368 (2019) [hereinafter Zarsky, Privacy and Manipulation] (suggesting that manipulation-based arguments are preferable to privacy theories, which are plagued with substantial theoretical shortcomings and pitfalls).[\/footnote] The time has come to leverage this literature in service of a new direction for the field.\r\n\r\nThe Essay proceeds as follows. Part I traces the efforts of twentieth-century privacy scholars to define our subject matter, culminating in Solove\u2019s intervention in the early 2000s, and acknowledges the generative role of privacy\u2019s taxonomy paradigm. Part II argues that social recognition has always been a flawed means by which to distinguish privacy and that privacy as taxonomy stands in the way of identifying, reconciling, and distinguishing privacy harms in a diverse and complex information environment. Section II.A discusses information-based harms that privacy law was late to recognize, such as information-based discrimination and algorithmic manipulation. Section II.B discusses unresolved tensions between and among privacy and other values.\r\n\r\nPart III outlines a post-taxonomy research agenda for privacy law, one that decouples classification from social recognition, foregrounds the role of reflexivity, and begins to answer the deep question of just what work privacy is doing in the context of information-based harms. Misinformation, hate speech, bias, data sovereignty, labor extraction, and many other contemporary concerns implicate or involve privacy but sound in different values altogether. By uncritically broadening the concept of privacy, most Americans are missing out on a global conversation around data protection, information governance, and harm mitigation. Only by distinguishing privacy can privacy law reach its full potential as a discipline and a body of law.",
