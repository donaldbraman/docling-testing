				<p>College campuses across the country celebrate their legacies of creating free speech guarantees following student protests from the mid-1960s to early 1970s, even though colleges had minimal tolerance of such protests at the time. As part of the New Left’s vision for a different society, students, sometimes joined by faculty, demanded an end to the Vietnam War and war industry research, fought for Black and ethnic studies departments, and protested urban renewal plans that displaced Black working-class communities.</p>
<p>We are experiencing another transformative moment. Lawmakers and other stakeholders pressure university administrators to act against students or face funding cuts. Police repression follows, escalating into violence. Universities create or enlarge their own police or security forces in response, while also expanding codes of conduct to quash disruptive protest activity. This Symposium Piece traces the throughlines between university responses in the past and today.</p>
<p>This Piece also provides three features of policing campus protests. First, campus police and administrators engage in political surveillance, monitoring the political activity of the campus community, which enables universities to sanction students and faculty through campus codes of conduct and refer them for criminal prosecution. Second, police and administrators network with local and federal law enforcement agencies to share information. Third, police act formally and informally as part of the disciplinary process within universities to sanction and control protests. This Piece ends with contemporary and historic examples of university leaders who have avoided police repression as a response to student dissent and instead chosen negotiation.</p>

&nbsp;Advocates have been insisting on police reform, even the abolition of the police, since the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2012, but their outcry grew even more urgent after Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, and then again after police killed George Floyd in 2020.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

		See supra note 5. Still, administrators and university communities generally believe that, compared to municipal police, campus police operate as kinder, friendlier forces that are potentially aligned with the educational mission. See Andrea Allen, Are Campus Police ‘Real’ Police? Students’ Perceptions of Campus Versus Municipal Police, 94 Police J. 102, 115 (2021) (describing how students tend to view campus police as less likely to severely sanction suspects due to their better understanding of college life, famili­arity with students, and investment in student success).	</span>

		Many universities created task forces or underwent studies or reviews to deter­mine how they can best address the overall demand to reconsider the role and purpose of policing.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">These ideals espoused by college administrators following the rebel­lious summer of 2020 were quickly tested.

—this Piece instead aims to excavate the connections between past and present responses to stu­dent protests. It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre­vent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis­placed Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now,<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

		Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan­tytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race–class sub­jugated communities.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This Piece proceeds in four parts. Part I is a reminder that the con­flicts and struggles faced by today’s administrators echo those of their pre­decessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ­ism—the mid-1960s to early 1970s—this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

		Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty­towns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat &amp; Anushka Shorewala, From ‘Shantytown’ to the ‘Liberated Zone’: Cornell’s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https://cornellsun.com/2024/‌05/07/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments/ [https:// per​ma.cc/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024);&nbsp;Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation’s complicity with South Africa’s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ. (Nov. 16, 2011), https:// ​www.‌chron​icle.com/article/public-colleges-struggle-to-respond-to-occupy-protests/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>); see also, e.g., Christopher F. Edley, Jr. &amp; Charles F. Robinson, Response to Protests on UC Campuses 17–20 (2012), https://campusprotest‌re​port.‌universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/protest-report-0913​12.pdf [https://perma.cc/​‌69‌VH-‌Y77B] (reviewing the University of California’s policies regarding the administration’s response to student demonstrations and civil disobedi­ence). It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro­testers, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on.&nbsp;See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760–61 (2023) (out­lining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress “not only expressions of dis­sent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression”); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum. L. Rev. 1197, 1199–204 (2025) (clarifying the limits of criminalizing protest by analyzing overbreadth doctrine through Supreme Court case law, evaluating current protest-related statutes, and offering guidelines to reform or eliminate laws that are overly broad). For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt­ing a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel’s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine.

&nbsp;Part I also illustrates how the pressure applied today to silence and stop student mobilization at universities—leg­islative threats and funding cuts—was also present during this earlier time period.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part II analyzes ninety-six state and federal antiprotest legislative pro­posals and enactments since October 7, 2023, using an antiprotest legisla­tion database maintained by the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. It showcases the political and economic pressures weighing on the heads of universities as they determine whether to permit or limit certain types of protest and speech. Although much of this fervor has emerged as a response to pro-Palestine activity, the same legislation will no doubt apply and expand in response to agitation around other progressive and left-leaning causes in the future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part III demonstrates how protest policing functions through embed­ded campus police and their connections to local police. It maps how police and administrative leaders network and share infor­mation to enhance surveillance and how campus police are an integral part of uni­versity code of conduct and discipline processes. Some have criticized universities for using disciplinary processes in the context of pro­tests; even an administrative sanction can deter legitimate First Amendment speech activity.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show footnote-short" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part IV excavates some examples of past and present university admin­istrators choosing not to use police when faced with large-scale campus protest. This shows that even in moments of heightened political and eco­nomic pressure, some leaders make different decisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back, this project sits within the larger context of university policing in the lives of students, workers, and community members. This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro­test movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

&nbsp;Race and educa­tion scholars have long criticized campus police departments’ actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ­ees.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

		See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34,&nbsp;at 854 (“Studies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.” (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func­tions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race–class subju­gated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811–12, 864–65. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id.&nbsp;at 862–65.	</span>

&nbsp;Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for­mal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga­tions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

&nbsp;This Piece connects the past era of protest to recent years of student activism, framing the movements of the late 1960s, not as a comparison, but as a springboard for what is unfolding today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the focus on the Left and progressive causes is not to suggest the Right or conservative movements are not active on college cam­puses. Although worthy of its own study, the Right seems to use different tactics than traditional protest and demonstration, such as inviting controversial speakers to college campuses. In such instances, under prevailing views of the First Amendment, universities must take rea­sonable steps to accommodate speakers, which often means engaging police and private security at considerable costs to protect provocative speakers from dis­ruptors.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

&nbsp;Moreover, while growing systems of protest policing at universities may also increase police surveillance of student groups on the right, the asymmetry in tactics and disruption leads to different con­se­quences. Some groups operate under the threat of violence and intru­sion for their protest tactics, while others seem to receive protection from col­leges.</p>

Several experts on protest movements have noted the unusual use of suspensions and expulsions in the pro-Palestine context when compared to other contemporary student protests, such as those against schools\u2019 investments in the fossil fuel or private prison industries.

They note the level of suspen\u00adsions or threats of suspension is more similar to the levels seen many decades ago during anti\u2013Vietnam War and anti-apartheid protests. See id. That is to say, others have noted that the protests of the 2000s and early 2020s didn\u2019t lead to as many sanctions across the board as these two bookend moments. See id.[\/footnote]\u00a0While some seek to distinguish the past from pre\u00adsent\u2014claiming the past eras were less repressive and the causes more just, or more sympathetic to university officials[footnote]See, e.g., Wines, supra note 15\u00a0(interviewing a former elected official who had protested the Vietnam War in the 1960s, who said that the current war in Gaza \u201chas a lot more moral and philosophical nuance\u201d than the United States\u2019 involvement in Vietnam, which was a \u201cshow of superpower hubris\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Miles Rapoport, former Conn. Sec\u2019y of State)). For a broader discussion on how activist movements recover and use forgotten or marginalized histories to inform contemporary struggles, see generally Aziz Choudry &amp; Salim Vally, History\u2019s Schools: Past Struggles and Present Realities, <em>in<\/em> Reflections on Knowledge, Learning and Social Movements: History\u2019s Schools 1 (Aziz Choudry &amp; Salim Valley eds., 2017).[\/footnote]\u2014this Piece instead aims to excavate the connections between past and present responses to stu\u00addent protests. It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre\u00advent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis\u00adplaced Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now,[footnote]Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan\u00adtytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

Soule, The Student Divestment Movement in the United States and Tactical Diffusion: The Shantytown Protest, 75 Soc. Forces 855, 864 (1997).[\/footnote]\u00a0and campus police agencies as they exist today formed in response to the widespread activ\u00adism in that period. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities across the United States tasked local and state police officers with controlling college campuses and disrupting public dissent, sometimes unnecessarily and violently.[footnote]See Jerome H. Skolnick, Task Force on Demonstrations, Protests, &amp; Grp. Violence, The Politics of Protest: Violent Aspects of Protest &amp; Confrontation 185\u201386 (1969) (referencing the Kerner Commission\u2019s finding that, during the 1967 riots, \u201cpolice violence was out of control\u201d and the Cox and Sparling Commissions\u2019 findings that police used unnecessary force, often vindictively, against both peaceful and \u201cprovocative\u201d pro\u00adtesters (internal quotation marks omitted)).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this Piece explains, during the student protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, administrators and university presidents faced intense economic and political pressure to quash the escalating mobilizations. Heads of universities faced strong criticism and threats of (or actual) reprisal for inaction or delayed action.[footnote]See infra section II.B.1.[\/footnote]\u00a0States and administrators rushed to create in-house campus police forces that answered to the heads of universities, in part to avoid the type of police violence that led to inci\u00addents such as the Kent State massacre.[footnote]See Vanessa Miller &amp; Katheryn Russell-Brown, Policing the College Campus: History, Race, and Law, 29 Wash. &amp; Lee J.

For example, university presidents faced considerable pressure from, among other sources, federal lawmakers and state legislatures to eliminate the spring 2024 encampments and quash protected pro-Palestine speech.[footnote]Other sources of pressure not addressed in this Piece but worth acknowledging are major donors and private influence.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race\u2013class sub\u00adjugated communities. See id. at 870 n.385 (collecting sources).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Piece proceeds in four parts. Part I is a reminder that the con\u00adflicts and struggles faced by today\u2019s administrators echo those of their pre\u00addecessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ\u00adism\u2014the mid-1960s to early 1970s\u2014this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity.[footnote]Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty\u00adtowns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat &amp; Anushka Shorewala, From \u2018Shantytown\u2019 to the \u2018Liberated Zone\u2019: Cornell\u2019s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https:\/\/cornellsun.com\/2024\/\u200c05\/07\/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments\/ [https:\/\/ per\u200bma.cc\/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024);\u00a0Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation\u2019s complicity with South Africa\u2019s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ.

It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro\u00adtesters, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on.\u00a0See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760\u201361 (2023) (out\u00adlining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress \u201cnot only expressions of dis\u00adsent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression\u201d); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum.

For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt\u00ading a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine.

It showcases the political and economic pressures weighing on the heads of universities as they determine whether to permit or limit certain types of protest and speech. Although much of this fervor has emerged as a response to pro-Palestine activity, the same legislation will no doubt apply and expand in response to agitation around other progressive and left-leaning causes in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III demonstrates how protest policing functions through embed\u00added campus police and their connections to local police. It maps how police and administrative leaders network and share infor\u00admation to enhance surveillance and how campus police are an integral part of uni\u00adversity code of conduct and discipline processes. Some have criticized universities for using disciplinary processes in the context of pro\u00adtests; even an administrative sanction can deter legitimate First Amendment speech activity.[footnote]See infra note 545\u00a0and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part IV excavates some examples of past and present university admin\u00adistrators choosing not to use police when faced with large-scale campus protest. This shows that even in moments of heightened political and eco\u00adnomic pressure, some leaders make different decisions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back, this project sits within the larger context of university policing in the lives of students, workers, and community members. This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro\u00adtest movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah Michelson, Student Workers on Strike at UCLA, Knock LA (Dec. 1, 2022), https:\/\/knock-la.com\/ucla-student-workers-strike\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/FT9C-72\u200bT8].[\/footnote]\u00a0Race and educa\u00adtion scholars have long criticized campus police departments\u2019 actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ\u00adees.[footnote]See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34,\u00a0at 854 (\u201cStudies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.\u201d (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func\u00adtions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race\u2013class subju\u00adgated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811\u201312, 864\u201365. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id.\u00a0at 862\u201365.[\/footnote]\u00a0Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for\u00admal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga\u00adtions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out.[footnote]See id. at 837 (noting that campus police are integrated into \u201cthreat assessment teams as part of the university administration\u2019s efforts to uphold its legal obligations to secure and maintain campus safety\u201d); infra note 79\u00a0and accompanying text (describing how universities expanded into surrounding communities as part of urban renewal efforts).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while this Piece focuses on certain time periods, it is important to acknowledge the rich tradition of student protests on the left before and after the mid-1960s to early 1970s.

It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre\u00advent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis\u00adplaced Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now,[footnote]Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan\u00adtytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

For example, university presidents faced considerable pressure from, among other sources, federal lawmakers and state legislatures to eliminate the spring 2024 encampments and quash protected pro-Palestine speech.[footnote]Other sources of pressure not addressed in this Piece but worth acknowledging are major donors and private influence.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848.

Part I is a reminder that the con\u00adflicts and struggles faced by today\u2019s administrators echo those of their pre\u00addecessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ\u00adism\u2014the mid-1960s to early 1970s\u2014this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity.[footnote]Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty\u00adtowns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption.

Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation\u2019s complicity with South Africa\u2019s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future.

It showcases the political and economic pressures weighing on the heads of universities as they determine whether to permit or limit certain types of protest and speech. Although much of this fervor has emerged as a response to pro-Palestine activity, the same legislation will no doubt apply and expand in response to agitation around other progressive and left-leaning causes in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III demonstrates how protest policing functions through embed\u00added campus police and their connections to local police. It maps how police and administrative leaders network and share infor\u00admation to enhance surveillance and how campus police are an integral part of uni\u00adversity code of conduct and discipline processes. Some have criticized universities for using disciplinary processes in the context of pro\u00adtests; even an administrative sanction can deter legitimate First Amendment speech activity.[footnote]See infra note 545\u00a0and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part IV excavates some examples of past and present university admin\u00adistrators choosing not to use police when faced with large-scale campus protest. This shows that even in moments of heightened political and eco\u00adnomic pressure, some leaders make different decisions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back, this project sits within the larger context of university policing in the lives of students, workers, and community members. This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro\u00adtest movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah Michelson, Student Workers on Strike at UCLA, Knock LA (Dec. 1, 2022), https:\/\/knock-la.com\/ucla-student-workers-strike\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/FT9C-72\u200bT8].[\/footnote]\u00a0Race and educa\u00adtion scholars have long criticized campus police departments\u2019 actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ\u00adees.[footnote]See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34,\u00a0at 854 (\u201cStudies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.\u201d (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func\u00adtions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race\u2013class subju\u00adgated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811\u201312, 864\u201365. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id.\u00a0at 862\u201365.[\/footnote]\u00a0Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for\u00admal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga\u00adtions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out.[footnote]See id. at 837 (noting that campus police are integrated into \u201cthreat assessment teams as part of the university administration\u2019s efforts to uphold its legal obligations to secure and maintain campus safety\u201d); infra note 79\u00a0and accompanying text (describing how universities expanded into surrounding communities as part of urban renewal efforts).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while this Piece focuses on certain time periods, it is important to acknowledge the rich tradition of student protests on the left before and after the mid-1960s to early 1970s.

Although worthy of its own study, the Right seems to use different tactics than traditional protest and demonstration, such as inviting controversial speakers to college campuses. In such instances, under prevailing views of the First Amendment, universities must take rea\u00adsonable steps to accommodate speakers, which often means engaging police and private security at considerable costs to protect provocative speakers from dis\u00adruptors.[footnote]See, e.g., Teresa Watanabe, UC System Will Chip in at Least $300,000 to Help Berkeley Pay Security Costs for Controversial Speakers, L.A. Times (Sept. 20, 2017), https: \u200b\/\/ \u200cwww.latimes.com\/local\/lanow\/la-me-ln-uc-berkeley-security-20170920-story.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (reporting security costs totaling millions for speak\u00aders such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro); see also Jocelyn Gecker, UC Berkeley Spent $4 Million for Free Speech Event Security, Wash.

It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre\u00advent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis\u00adplaced Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now,[footnote]Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan\u00adtytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities across the United States tasked local and state police officers with controlling college campuses and disrupting public dissent, sometimes unnecessarily and violently.[footnote]See Jerome H.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race\u2013class sub\u00adjugated communities.

Part I is a reminder that the con\u00adflicts and struggles faced by today\u2019s administrators echo those of their pre\u00addecessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ\u00adism\u2014the mid-1960s to early 1970s\u2014this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity.[footnote]Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty\u00adtowns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat &amp; Anushka Shorewala, From \u2018Shantytown\u2019 to the \u2018Liberated Zone\u2019: Cornell\u2019s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https:\/\/cornellsun.com\/2024\/\u200c05\/07\/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments\/ [https:\/\/ per\u200bma.cc\/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024);\u00a0Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation\u2019s complicity with South Africa\u2019s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ.

It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro\u00adtesters, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on.\u00a0See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760\u201361 (2023) (out\u00adlining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress \u201cnot only expressions of dis\u00adsent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression\u201d); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum.

For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt\u00ading a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine.

It showcases the political and economic pressures weighing on the heads of universities as they determine whether to permit or limit certain types of protest and speech. Although much of this fervor has emerged as a response to pro-Palestine activity, the same legislation will no doubt apply and expand in response to agitation around other progressive and left-leaning causes in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III demonstrates how protest policing functions through embed\u00added campus police and their connections to local police. It maps how police and administrative leaders network and share infor\u00admation to enhance surveillance and how campus police are an integral part of uni\u00adversity code of conduct and discipline processes. Some have criticized universities for using disciplinary processes in the context of pro\u00adtests; even an administrative sanction can deter legitimate First Amendment speech activity.[footnote]See infra note 545\u00a0and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part IV excavates some examples of past and present university admin\u00adistrators choosing not to use police when faced with large-scale campus protest. This shows that even in moments of heightened political and eco\u00adnomic pressure, some leaders make different decisions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back, this project sits within the larger context of university policing in the lives of students, workers, and community members. This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro\u00adtest movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah Michelson, Student Workers on Strike at UCLA, Knock LA (Dec. 1, 2022), https:\/\/knock-la.com\/ucla-student-workers-strike\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/FT9C-72\u200bT8].[\/footnote]\u00a0Race and educa\u00adtion scholars have long criticized campus police departments\u2019 actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ\u00adees.[footnote]See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34,\u00a0at 854 (\u201cStudies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.\u201d (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func\u00adtions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race\u2013class subju\u00adgated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811\u201312, 864\u201365. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id.\u00a0at 862\u201365.[\/footnote]\u00a0Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for\u00admal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga\u00adtions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out.[footnote]See id. at 837 (noting that campus police are integrated into \u201cthreat assessment teams as part of the university administration\u2019s efforts to uphold its legal obligations to secure and maintain campus safety\u201d); infra note 79\u00a0and accompanying text (describing how universities expanded into surrounding communities as part of urban renewal efforts).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while this Piece focuses on certain time periods, it is important to acknowledge the rich tradition of student protests on the left before and after the mid-1960s to early 1970s.

Although worthy of its own study, the Right seems to use different tactics than traditional protest and demonstration, such as inviting controversial speakers to college campuses. In such instances, under prevailing views of the First Amendment, universities must take rea\u00adsonable steps to accommodate speakers, which often means engaging police and private security at considerable costs to protect provocative speakers from dis\u00adruptors.[footnote]See, e.g., Teresa Watanabe, UC System Will Chip in at Least $300,000 to Help Berkeley Pay Security Costs for Controversial Speakers, L.A.

It specifically focuses on the student protest movements of the mid-1960s to early 1970s: demands to end the Vietnam War and war industry research, create Black and Ethnic Studies departments, and pre\u00advent the enactment of urban renewal plans that dis\u00adplaced Black working-class communities. This Piece focuses on this period for a few reasons. By some measures, the scale of pro-Palestine student protest is likely greater than any of the movements between then and now,[footnote]Of course, comparisons will be difficult to quantify or measure, and metrics such as numbers of arrests related to campus protests or disciplinary charges are faulty. This Piece argues that arrests and disciplinary actions are expected to be more common today because the infrastructure for these steps was created in response to past protests. However, some sources note that more schools saw pro-Palestine encampments than shan\u00adtytowns protesting South African apartheid. For example, scholars have estimated that there were 46 shantytown events on college campuses between 1985 and 1990 during the anti-apartheid movement, as compared to 138 encampments between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities across the United States tasked local and state police officers with controlling college campuses and disrupting public dissent, sometimes unnecessarily and violently.[footnote]See Jerome H.

For example, university presidents faced considerable pressure from, among other sources, federal lawmakers and state legislatures to eliminate the spring 2024 encampments and quash protected pro-Palestine speech.[footnote]Other sources of pressure not addressed in this Piece but worth acknowledging are major donors and private influence. See Alan Blinder, For Columbia and a Powerful Donor, Months of Talks and Millions at Risk, N.Y.

More broadly, university police have been under-studied in policing scholarship, yet they increasingly police local communities and maintain racialized borders between colleges and the surrounding areas. See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34, at 848. Some scholars suggest university police serve as a public good, acting as adjuncts to local police forces by adding capacity and resources to historically underserved, race\u2013class sub\u00adjugated communities. See id. at 870 n.385 (collecting sources).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Piece proceeds in four parts. Part I is a reminder that the con\u00adflicts and struggles faced by today\u2019s administrators echo those of their pre\u00addecessors. By focusing on another period of large-scale student activ\u00adism\u2014the mid-1960s to early 1970s\u2014this Piece shows how campus police grew in authority and numbers in response to protests during this time and how codes of conduct were expanded to more explicitly address unrest and free speech activity.[footnote]Of course, campuses have seen periods of student mobilization beyond the ones addressed in this Piece. Here are a few others: The 1990s anti-apartheid student shanty\u00adtowns were met with police hostility at schools such as Yale and UCLA, but were sometimes permitted to continue without much disruption. See Matthew Kiviat &amp; Anushka Shorewala, From \u2018Shantytown\u2019 to the \u2018Liberated Zone\u2019: Cornell\u2019s History of Encampments, Cornell Daily Sun (May 6, 2024), https:\/\/cornellsun.com\/2024\/\u200c05\/07\/from-shantytown-to-the-liberated-zone-cornells-history-of-encampments\/ [https:\/\/ per\u200bma.cc\/J9D2-ZFE7] (last upd-ated May 7, 2024);\u00a0Narea, supra note 39. Unlike the antiwar student protests of the 1960s, however, students faced less pushback due to an embarrassment among American leaders regarding the nation\u2019s complicity with South Africa\u2019s white government. See Narea, supra note 39. And during Occupy Wall Street student protests, the excessive police response was met with apologies and police reform studies to prevent such violence in the future. See Josh Keller, Public Colleges Struggle to Respond to Occupy Protests, Chron. Higher Educ. (Nov. 16, 2011), https:\/\/ \u200bwww.\u200cchron\u200bicle.com\/article\/public-colleges-struggle-to-respond-to-occupy-protests\/ (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); see also, e.g., Christopher F.

It is worth noting here that this Part does not address criminal prosecutions against pro\u00adtesters, an important topic that others in this Symposium and elsewhere are focused on.\u00a0See, e.g., Amber Baylor, Unexceptional Protest, 70 UCLA L. Rev. 716, 760\u201361 (2023) (out\u00adlining how antiprotest laws have been deployed to suppress \u201cnot only expressions of dis\u00adsent, but also gatherings and effervescence of joy, sharing, and expression\u201d); Rachel Moran, Overbroad Protest Laws, 125 Colum.

For example, a group of ten students was convicted of disrupt\u00ading a public meeting after protesting a speech by Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States at UC-Irvine. Lauren Williams, Nicole Santa Cruz &amp; Mike Anton, Students Guilty of Disrupting Speech in \u2018Irvine 11\u2019 Case, L.A.

It showcases the political and economic pressures weighing on the heads of universities as they determine whether to permit or limit certain types of protest and speech. Although much of this fervor has emerged as a response to pro-Palestine activity, the same legislation will no doubt apply and expand in response to agitation around other progressive and left-leaning causes in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III demonstrates how protest policing functions through embed\u00added campus police and their connections to local police. It maps how police and administrative leaders network and share infor\u00admation to enhance surveillance and how campus police are an integral part of uni\u00adversity code of conduct and discipline processes. Some have criticized universities for using disciplinary processes in the context of pro\u00adtests; even an administrative sanction can deter legitimate First Amendment speech activity.[footnote]See infra note 545\u00a0and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part IV excavates some examples of past and present university admin\u00adistrators choosing not to use police when faced with large-scale campus protest. This shows that even in moments of heightened political and eco\u00adnomic pressure, some leaders make different decisions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back, this project sits within the larger context of university policing in the lives of students, workers, and community members. This Piece focuses on the levers that grow policing on campuses. Student pro\u00adtest movements can balloon the authority and resources for campus police, but any surge in campus police as regulators of protest demands will carry ripple effects for other uses of police. For example, university administrators use campus police to quash labor actions and disrupt picket lines when university workers decide to strike.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah Michelson, Student Workers on Strike at UCLA, Knock LA (Dec. 1, 2022), https:\/\/knock-la.com\/ucla-student-workers-strike\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/FT9C-72\u200bT8].[\/footnote]\u00a0Race and educa\u00adtion scholars have long criticized campus police departments\u2019 actions, such as targeting investigative resources toward Black and Latinx people on campus, as contributing to unbelonging for those students and employ\u00adees.[footnote]See Patel, Transinstitutional Policing, supra note 34,\u00a0at 854 (\u201cStudies have shown that university policing disproportionately targets Black and Latinx students, furthering a sense of alienation from their peers and carrying negative educational consequences.\u201d (footnote omitted)). When university administrators use police for problem-solving func\u00adtions (e.g., crisis response), it likely leads to the alienation and distrust of race\u2013class subju\u00adgated students from the institution. Police blur the boundaries between policing and other institutional operations. This author has argued elsewhere that information sharing between police and administrators serves a gatekeeping function, altering the quality and type of educational services students may receive. See id. at 811\u201312, 864\u201365. Race and education scholars have made the empirical and theoretical case for this proposition. See id.\u00a0at 862\u201365.[\/footnote]\u00a0Campus police also extend their reach to areas surrounding the for\u00admal campus boundaries, purportedly to uphold legal obliga\u00adtions to provide and maintain campus safety, but also to retain university land holdings and keep low-income or unhoused neighbors out.[footnote]See id. at 837 (noting that campus police are integrated into \u201cthreat assessment teams as part of the university administration\u2019s efforts to uphold its legal obligations to secure and maintain campus safety\u201d); infra note 79\u00a0and accompanying text (describing how universities expanded into surrounding communities as part of urban renewal efforts).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while this Piece focuses on certain time periods, it is important to acknowledge the rich tradition of student protests on the left before and after the mid-1960s to early 1970s.

Although worthy of its own study, the Right seems to use different tactics than traditional protest and demonstration, such as inviting controversial speakers to college campuses. In such instances, under prevailing views of the First Amendment, universities must take rea\u00adsonable steps to accommodate speakers, which often means engaging police and private security at considerable costs to protect provocative speakers from dis\u00adruptors.[footnote]See, e.g., Teresa Watanabe, UC System Will Chip in at Least $300,000 to Help Berkeley Pay Security Costs for Controversial Speakers, L.A.
