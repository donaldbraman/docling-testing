				<p>The growth of private companies in the realm of carceral healthcare services has significant implications for plaintiffs seeking to challenge disability discrimination perpetrated during their incarceration. As the face of disability discrimination changes in carceral facilities, so should the legal remedies that hold them to account. This Note outlines the cur-rent scope of disability antidiscrimination litigation in prisons, jails, and detention centers as well as this framework’s shortcomings in confronting the rise of privatized carceral healthcare services (referred to as “prison healthcare companies”). This Note then proposes a public accommodations theory of disability antidiscrimination law, under which incarcerated plaintiffs can utilize Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and state public accommodations law to seek both injunctive and monetary relief for disability discrimination they suffer under a privatized healthcare regime.</p>

 These statutory barriers in both the ADA and sec­tion 504 prevent disabled plaintiffs from bringing discrimination lawsuits against the companies that, as in the case of Abraham and countless oth­ers, perpetrate—and often profit off—their mistreatment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the face of disability discrimination changes in carceral facilities, so should the legal remedies that hold them to account. This Note there­fore seeks to build the case that incarcerated individuals with disabilities can utilize Title III of the ADA and state public accommodations laws to bring disability discrimination claims against private medical corporations. Part I outlines the current remedial framework for disability discrimina­tion claims and its application to the carceral context. Part II discusses the shortcomings of this framework in responding to the increasing privatiza­tion of prison healthcare. Against this legal backdrop, Part III proposes a framework for disability discrimination claims against prison healthcare companies. It surveys potential challenges to Title III’s applicability to pris­ons and, using both federal and state antidiscrimination law, outlines the affirmative case for a public accommodations theory of private prison healthcare, as well as the advantages of such an approach.</p>

Part I outlines the current remedial framework for disability discrimina\u00adtion claims and its application to the carceral context. Part II discusses the shortcomings of this framework in responding to the increasing privatiza\u00adtion of prison healthcare. Against this legal backdrop, Part III proposes a framework for disability discrimination claims against prison healthcare companies. It surveys potential challenges to Title III\u2019s applicability to pris\u00adons and, using both federal and state antidiscrimination law, outlines the affirmative case for a public accommodations theory of private prison healthcare, as well as the advantages of such an approach.<\/p>",

Corizon Health, Inc., 985 F.3d 1198 (9th Cir. 2021) (No.\u00a019-36077), 2020 WL 3621048. Abraham passed away at the age of fifty-five while his lawsuit was still pending. See Zane Sparling, Oregon Supreme Court Orders Private Companies Operating in Jails to Follow Anti-Discrimination Laws, OregonLive (June 8, 2022), https:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/crime\/2022\/06\/oregon-supreme-court-orders-private-companies-in-jails-to-follow-anti-discrimination-laws.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] Abraham was born deaf, and his primary language was American Sign Language (\u201cASL\u201d).[footnote]Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief, supra note 1, at 3.[\/footnote] Like many deaf people, Abraham preferred using videoconferencing software when he needed to communicate with nondeaf people.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] These facts were lost on staff at the Clackamas County Jail who, on October 23, 2015, conducted a mental health evaluation on Abraham without an ASL interpreter.[footnote]Id. at 4.[\/footnote] In a screening conducted entirely in spoken English, which bears little resemblance to ASL,[footnote]American Sign Language, R.I.

For many, it will come as a great surprise that ASL has more similarities to spoken Japanese and Navajo than to English.\u201d).[\/footnote] the deputy in charge concluded that Abraham was suicidal.[footnote]Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief, supra note 1, at 4.[\/footnote] Jail staff proceeded to strip Abraham and place him on suicide watch.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abraham spent three days in isolation without any means of commu\u00adnication.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Without an interpreter, he was unable to explain to medical staff that he was not only deaf but also diabetic, and he needed insulin to man\u00adage his disease.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote]Staff, on the other hand, repeatedly interpreted his lack of communication as a refusal of his insulin and his meals.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] As a result, Abraham ended up spending days trapped without any means to get his medication.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] When Abraham was finally released from jail, he filed a class action lawsuit seeking both injunctive and monetary relief for the discrim\u00adination he experienced on account of his multiple disabilities.[footnote]Abraham v.

Apr. 10, 2017).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The facts of Abraham\u2019s case are tragically commonplace in prisons and jails across the United States.[footnote]See, e.g., Lippert v.

Corizon Health, Inc., 511 P.3d 1083 (Or. 2022) (No.\u00a0S068265), 2021 WL 4812511 (sharing stories of suffering disabled people have endured in correctional settings\u2014stories that \u201cwere not selected because they are, in any way, exceptional; rather, they were selected because they exemplify the routine failures\u201d baked into the system).[\/footnote] Disabled people are overrepresented in the U.S. incarcerated population, with roughly 40% of all incarcerated people reporting at least one disability.[footnote]Laura M. Maruschak, Jennifer Bronson &amp; Mariel Alper, DOJ, Survey of Prison Inmates, 2016: Disabilities Reported by Prisoners 2 (2021) https:\/\/bjs.ojp.gov\/content\/\u200cpub\/pdf\/drpspi16st.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/M825-85SY] (\u201cState and federal prisoners (38%) were about two and a half times more likely to report a disability than adults in the U.S. general population (15%)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Disturbingly, there is no reliable data on the preva\u00adlence of disabilities among immigrants in the United States, many of whom are sent to prison-like detention facilities while they await their deportation hearings. See Trinh Q. Truong, Emily DiMatteo &amp; Mia Ives-Rublee, Crossing the Border: How Disability Civil Rights Protections Can Include Disabled Asylum-Seekers, Ctr. for Am. Progress (Aug. 24, 2022), https:\/\/www.americanprogress.org\/article\/crossing-the-border-how-disability-civil-rights-protections-can-include-disabled-asylum-seekers\/ [https:\/\/perma.cc\/T5HK-87HN] (\u201cAn estimated 12 million people with disabilities were forcibly displaced worldwide in 2020 alone. The actual number is likely even higher, but because data collection instruments tend to ignore disabled status or are not accessible to all disabled people, there are no inclusive, reliable data about this\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0population.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).[\/footnote] These demographic realities reflect in part the fact that people targeted by the criminal legal system are far poorer and less able to access healthcare than their nonincarcerated counterparts.[footnote]See Leah Wang, Chronic Punishment: The Unmet Health Needs of People in State Prisons, Prison Pol\u2019y Initiative (June 2022), https:\/\/www.prisonpolicy.org\/reports\/\u200cchronicpunishment.html#disability [https:\/\/perma.cc\/HU2R-B6ZS] (\u201c[H]alf (50%) of people in state prisons lacked health insurance at the time of their arrest.

The study also notes that 32% of incarcerated people who received healthcare relied on Medicaid. Id. [\/footnote] Incarceration itself also takes a significant toll on disabled people, often exacerbating their disabilities or generating new ones alto\u00adgether.[footnote]See Jamelia Morgan, ACLU, Caged in: Solitary Confinement\u2019s Devastating Harm on Prisoners With Physical Disabilities 26\u201327 (2017), https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/wp-content\/\u200cuploads\/publications\/010916-aclu-solitarydisabilityreport-single.pdf [https:\/\/perma.cc\/\u200cT9AF-4FSM] [hereinafter Morgan, Caged in] (noting that people with physical disabilities are \u201cparticularly susceptible to worsening physical\u201d and mental health while they are incar\u00adcerated); see also Jill S.

It surveys potential challenges to Title III\u2019s applicability to pris\u00adons and, using both federal and state antidiscrimination law, outlines the affirmative case for a public accommodations theory of private prison healthcare, as well as the advantages of such an approach.<\/p>",

Disturbingly, there is no reliable data on the preva\u00adlence of disabilities among immigrants in the United States, many of whom are sent to prison-like detention facilities while they await their deportation hearings.

The study also notes that 32% of incarcerated people who received healthcare relied on Medicaid. Id.

Douberly, 604 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir. 2010).[\/footnote] For those seeking to bring a disability discrimination claim from federal cus\u00adtody, the consensus view among circuits is that a plaintiff can only sue a private company under section 504 if the company receives \u201cfederal finan\u00adcial assistance,\u201d or subsidies from the federal government that go beyond mere compensation.[footnote]See Shotz v.

Delta Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1202, 1210 (9th Cir. 1984).[\/footnote] These statutory barriers in both the ADA and sec\u00adtion 504 prevent disabled plaintiffs from bringing discrimination lawsuits against the companies that, as in the case of Abraham and countless oth\u00aders, perpetrate\u2014and often profit off\u2014their mistreatment.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the face of disability discrimination changes in carceral facilities, so should the legal remedies that hold them to account.
