				<p>From April 2016 until February 2017, thousands of people gathered along the Cannonball River on the border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In response, state officials tried to close down roads leading to the Reservation, considered legislation that would immunize drivers who struck protesters with vehicles, and arrested hundreds of peaceful demonstrators. The #NoDAPL protests built upon a legacy of resistance by Indigenous communities against the actions of the United States. While the history of Indigenous resistance predates the nation’s founding, the power to police protest activities on tribal lands has changed markedly.</p>
<p>This Symposium Piece considers the right to protest in Indian country. It confronts the framework that apportions regulatory and adjudicatory power over protest activity occurring on tribal land and suggests that such regulation ought to be left entirely to the tribal sovereign. Alternatively, it argues that state regulation of protest activity in Indian country is an infringement on tribal governments’ right to make their own laws or is otherwise preempted by overwhelming tribal and federal interests. This Piece further recognizes that while the United States could impose regulations on protest activity, there are strong prudential factors that suggest it should defer regulation to the tribal sovereign. By subjecting the right to protest in Indian country solely to regulations imposed by tribal government, the United States would be respecting tribal sovereignty.</p>

		The author recognizes that the word “Indian” has a number of problematic and even overtly racist connotations. Its use in this Symposium Piece is as a legal term of art. This Piece uses the term “Indian” instead of “Native” or “Indigenous” only when it is necessary to refer to persons who are enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. For example, Native Hawaiians are Indigenous, but they are not Indians. Rebecca Tsosie, Engaging the Spirit of Racial Healing Within Critical Race Theory: An Exercise in Transformative Thought, 11 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 21, 42 (2005). The term “Indian” is regularly used in federal law (e.g., Title 25 of the U.S. Code is the Title dealing with “Indians”), and it is used in the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to contradistinguish “Indian [t]ribes” from fellow sover­eigns “[s]tates” and “foreign [n]ations.” U.S. Const. art. I, §&nbsp;8, cl. 3. The term is used to codify the definition of “Indian country” at 18 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1151 and is used to determine which tribes share in a government-to-government relationship through the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791. For a discussion of how the term “Indian” is more problematic in other contexts, see H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World 60 n.1 (5th ed. 2014). The author further recognizes there is divided guidance on the capitalization of the term “Indian country.” The Bureau of Indian Affairs suggests always capitalizing the term. See Editorial Guide, Bureau of Indian Affs., https://www.bia.gov/guide/editorial-guide [https://perma.cc/7KXD-RP9U] (last visited Feb. 7, 2025). But the author has chosen to use the National Congress of American Indians’ style preference, which capitalizes the term “Indian Country” when referring to “a general description of Native spaces and places within the United States” but not when referring to the legal term of art defined in the U.S. Code. NCAI Response to Usage of the Term, “Indian Country”, Nat’l Cong. of Am. Indians (Dec. 27, 2019), https://www.ncai.org/news/ncai-response-to-usage-of-the-term-indian-country [https://perma.cc/5ZMD-4TXQ].	</span>

		We know that protests by Indigenous people must have been common because, as <em>Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law</em> explains, from the first days of the British colonies, the early American government “sought to forestall further Native anger by asserting greater centralized authority over Indian affairs.” Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law §&nbsp;2.02 (2024). Officers were appointed to handle Indian affairs. “The importance of these offices is indicated by the fact that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Benjamin Franklin, Patrick Henry, and James Wilson” were elected commissioners of the middle department. Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 9 (1942). Cohen tells us that there were many discussions involving these appointed commissioners, sometimes leading to “formal, written treaties with Native nations.” Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law, supra, §&nbsp;2.03. The “first such treaty” was the 1778 Treaty with the Delaware (Lenape) Nation. Id.	</span>

 Justice Stephen Breyer has described the case as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>   Wirt then found the case he was looking for. A New England missionary, Samuel A. Worcester, living in Cherokee territory had refused to sign Georgia’s loyalty oath, and Georgia had jailed him. He could bring Worcester’s case to the Supreme Court by way of appeal, and it was unlikely that Georgia would execute Worcester—a citizen of Vermont—before the Court could decide it. He did appeal. He pointed to the treaties and to Article VI of the Constitution, which makes treaties (along with the Constitution and federal laws) the “supreme Law of the Land.” And, not surprisingly, he won the case—despite the unpopularity of the Indian tribes and the popularity of Georgia’s position. The Court decided that the Cherokees owned the land; that Georgia had no right to make laws there; and that Worcester must be freed.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This Symposium Piece builds upon a history of protest by Indigenous people and dozens of Supreme Court opinions on tribal jurisdiction to first make a legal claim and then a normative assertion about the power to regulate protests in Indian country. First, tribes have the exclusive power to regulate protest activity when it occurs in Indian country. This exercise of a tribe’s inherent power applies even on land owned by the state or by nonmembers of the tribe if it occurs within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Second, while a tribe’s exercise of its inherent power to regu­late these protests is not constrained by the U.S. Constitution, tribal governments should be scrupulous in the imposition of penalties for con­duct which would otherwise be protected by federal law.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To justify these positions, this Piece proceeds in three Parts. Part I defines the places over which tribal regulatory authority is exclusive. It uses the contours of “Indian country”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show" style="display: block; visibility: visible;">

 to describe the legally defined spaces over which tribal exercise of their inherent regulatory power is greatest and makes clear that these spaces include land owned in fee simple by nonmembers when that land is within the reservation’s boundaries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part II explores the inherent regulatory power of Indian tribes. It builds upon well-established Supreme Court precedent to justify why a tribe’s inherent power to regulate protest activity exists throughout Indian country. Having established that such tribal power exists, it then uses the doctrines of infringement and preemption to explain why states lack con­current regulatory authority, leaving the tribal sovereign as the sole authority to regulate protest activity in Indian country. Part II concludes with a discussion of federal power, recognizing that Congress could impose regulations regarding protest activity on tribal lands but suggesting that it will not do so both because of its stated commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and because its recent legislative history has shown a reticence to impose new federal regulations on Indian tribes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part III turns to the tribal sovereign. It explains that tribal govern­ments, unlike state or federal governments, are not bound by the U.S. Constitution—including its protections for freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition. Part III then looks at existing tribal regulation and enforcement of protest in Indian country, particularly against tribal members, and cautions tribes to be intentional with the pun­ishment of conduct that would otherwise be federally protected.</p>

Its use in this Symposium Piece is as a legal term of art. This Piece uses the term \u201cIndian\u201d instead of \u201cNative\u201d or \u201cIndigenous\u201d only when it is necessary to refer to persons who are enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. For example, Native Hawaiians are Indigenous, but they are not Indians. Rebecca Tsosie, Engaging the Spirit of Racial Healing Within Critical Race Theory: An Exercise in Transformative Thought, 11 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 21, 42 (2005). The term \u201cIndian\u201d is regularly used in federal law (e.g., Title 25 of the U.S. Code is the Title dealing with \u201cIndians\u201d), and it is used in the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause to contradistinguish \u201cIndian [t]ribes\u201d from fellow sover\u00adeigns \u201c[s]tates\u201d and \u201cforeign [n]ations.\u201d U.S. Const. art.

The term is used to codify the definition of \u201cIndian country\u201d at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 and is used to determine which tribes share in a government-to-government relationship through the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791. For a discussion of how the term \u201cIndian\u201d is more problematic in other contexts, see H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World 60 n.1 (5th ed. 2014).

See Editorial Guide, Bureau of Indian Affs., https:\/\/www.bia.gov\/guide\/editorial-guide [https:\/\/perma.cc\/7KXD-RP9U] (last visited Feb. 7, 2025). But the author has chosen to use the National Congress of American Indians\u2019 style preference, which capitalizes the term \u201cIndian Country\u201d when referring to \u201ca general description of Native spaces and places within the United States\u201d but not when referring to the legal term of art defined in the U.S. Code.

A New England missionary, Samuel A. Worcester, living in Cherokee territory had refused to sign Georgia\u2019s loyalty oath, and Georgia had jailed him. He could bring Worcester\u2019s case to the Supreme Court by way of appeal, and it was unlikely that Georgia would execute Worcester\u2014a citizen of Vermont\u2014before the Court could decide it. He did appeal. He pointed to the treaties and to Article VI of the Constitution, which makes treaties (along with the Constitution and federal laws) the \u201csupreme Law of the Land.\u201d And, not surprisingly, he won the case\u2014despite the unpopularity of the Indian tribes and the popularity of Georgia\u2019s position.

First, tribes have the exclusive power to regulate protest activity when it occurs in Indian country. This exercise of a tribe\u2019s inherent power applies even on land owned by the state or by nonmembers of the tribe if it occurs within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Second, while a tribe\u2019s exercise of its inherent power to regu\u00adlate these protests is not constrained by the U.S. Constitution, tribal governments should be scrupulous in the imposition of penalties for con\u00adduct which would otherwise be protected by federal law.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To justify these positions, this Piece proceeds in three Parts. Part I defines the places over which tribal regulatory authority is exclusive. It uses the contours of \u201cIndian country\u201d[footnote]\u201cIndian country\u201d is a legal term of art defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 (2018). For additional context, see infra Part II.[\/footnote] to describe the legally defined spaces over which tribal exercise of their inherent regulatory power is greatest and makes clear that these spaces include land owned in fee simple by nonmembers when that land is within the reservation\u2019s boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part II explores the inherent regulatory power of Indian tribes. It builds upon well-established Supreme Court precedent to justify why a tribe\u2019s inherent power to regulate protest activity exists throughout Indian country. Having established that such tribal power exists, it then uses the doctrines of infringement and preemption to explain why states lack con\u00adcurrent regulatory authority, leaving the tribal sovereign as the sole authority to regulate protest activity in Indian country. Part II concludes with a discussion of federal power, recognizing that Congress could impose regulations regarding protest activity on tribal lands but suggesting that it will not do so both because of its stated commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and because its recent legislative history has shown a reticence to impose new federal regulations on Indian tribes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III turns to the tribal sovereign. It explains that tribal govern\u00adments, unlike state or federal governments, are not bound by the U.S. Constitution\u2014including its protections for freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition. Part III then looks at existing tribal regulation and enforcement of protest in Indian country, particularly against tribal members, and cautions tribes to be intentional with the pun\u00adishment of conduct that would otherwise be federally protected.<\/p>",

Coll. L. Mich. St. U. L. Rev. 783, 790\u201391.[\/footnote] During the occupation of Wounded Knee, a seventy-one day standoff between approximately 250 protesters and \u201ctribal law enforcement, U.S. marshals, the BIA police, and even U.S. military advisors\u201d ended with an exchange of gunfire and deaths on both sides.[footnote]Carole Goldberg, A Law of Their Own: Native Challenges to American Law, 25 Law &amp; Soc. Inquiry 263, 268\u201369 (2000) (book review).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Symposium Piece builds upon a history of protest by Indigenous people and dozens of Supreme Court opinions on tribal jurisdiction to first make a legal claim and then a normative assertion about the power to regulate protests in Indian country. First, tribes have the exclusive power to regulate protest activity when it occurs in Indian country. This exercise of a tribe\u2019s inherent power applies even on land owned by the state or by nonmembers of the tribe if it occurs within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Second, while a tribe\u2019s exercise of its inherent power to regu\u00adlate these protests is not constrained by the U.S. Constitution, tribal governments should be scrupulous in the imposition of penalties for con\u00adduct which would otherwise be protected by federal law.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To justify these positions, this Piece proceeds in three Parts. Part I defines the places over which tribal regulatory authority is exclusive. It uses the contours of \u201cIndian country\u201d[footnote]\u201cIndian country\u201d is a legal term of art defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 (2018). For additional context, see infra Part II.[\/footnote] to describe the legally defined spaces over which tribal exercise of their inherent regulatory power is greatest and makes clear that these spaces include land owned in fee simple by nonmembers when that land is within the reservation\u2019s boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part II explores the inherent regulatory power of Indian tribes. It builds upon well-established Supreme Court precedent to justify why a tribe\u2019s inherent power to regulate protest activity exists throughout Indian country. Having established that such tribal power exists, it then uses the doctrines of infringement and preemption to explain why states lack con\u00adcurrent regulatory authority, leaving the tribal sovereign as the sole authority to regulate protest activity in Indian country. Part II concludes with a discussion of federal power, recognizing that Congress could impose regulations regarding protest activity on tribal lands but suggesting that it will not do so both because of its stated commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and because its recent legislative history has shown a reticence to impose new federal regulations on Indian tribes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III turns to the tribal sovereign. It explains that tribal govern\u00adments, unlike state or federal governments, are not bound by the U.S. Constitution\u2014including its protections for freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition. Part III then looks at existing tribal regulation and enforcement of protest in Indian country, particularly against tribal members, and cautions tribes to be intentional with the pun\u00adishment of conduct that would otherwise be federally protected.<\/p>",

Beginning in late summer 2016, thousands of people began gathering on the northern boundary of the Standing Rock Indian[footnote]The author recognizes that the word \u201cIndian\u201d has a number of problematic and even overtly racist connotations. Its use in this Symposium Piece is as a legal term of art. This Piece uses the term \u201cIndian\u201d instead of \u201cNative\u201d or \u201cIndigenous\u201d only when it is necessary to refer to persons who are enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. For example, Native Hawaiians are Indigenous, but they are not Indians. Rebecca Tsosie, Engaging the Spirit of Racial Healing Within Critical Race Theory: An Exercise in Transformative Thought, 11 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 21, 42 (2005). The term \u201cIndian\u201d is regularly used in federal law (e.g., Title 25 of the U.S. Code is the Title dealing with \u201cIndians\u201d), and it is used in the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause to contradistinguish \u201cIndian [t]ribes\u201d from fellow sover\u00adeigns \u201c[s]tates\u201d and \u201cforeign [n]ations.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 3. The term is used to codify the definition of \u201cIndian country\u201d at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 and is used to determine which tribes share in a government-to-government relationship through the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791. For a discussion of how the term \u201cIndian\u201d is more problematic in other contexts, see H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World 60 n.1 (5th ed. 2014). The author further recognizes there is divided guidance on the capitalization of the term \u201cIndian country.\u201d The Bureau of Indian Affairs suggests always capitalizing the term. See Editorial Guide, Bureau of Indian Affs., https:\/\/www.bia.gov\/guide\/editorial-guide [https:\/\/perma.cc\/7KXD-RP9U] (last visited Feb. 7, 2025). But the author has chosen to use the National Congress of American Indians\u2019 style preference, which capitalizes the term \u201cIndian Country\u201d when referring to \u201ca general description of Native spaces and places within the United States\u201d but not when referring to the legal term of art defined in the U.S. Code.

Indigenous peoples have protested against the acts of colonizers since the arrival of Europeans, with the stories of most of those protests lost to history.[footnote]We know that protests by Indigenous people must have been common because, as <em>Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law<\/em> explains, from the first days of the British colonies, the early American government \u201csought to forestall further Native anger by asserting greater centralized authority over Indian affairs.\u201d Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a7\u00a02.02 (2024).

Benjamin Franklin, Patrick Henry, and James Wilson\u201d were elected commissioners of the middle department. Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 9 (1942).

Georgia <\/em>in 1831.[footnote]30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1 (1831).[\/footnote]The Cherokee Nation had a treaty with the United States, with lands clearly demarcated.[footnote]See Gregory Ablavsky, \u201cWith the Indian Tribes\u201d: Race, Citizenship, and Original Constitutional Meanings, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 1025, 1056\u201357 (2018) (describing the Treaty of Hopewell and the Treaty of Holston as treaties with the Cherokee that considered jurisdic\u00adtion and recognized territory belonging to the Tribe).[\/footnote] Georgia, claiming that the lands reserved by treaty were a part of the state, extended its criminal laws over the territory and crimi\u00adnally charged a Cherokee man, Corn Tassel, with violating Georgia law.[footnote]See Stephen Breyer, Making Our Democracy Work: The Yale Lectures, 120 Yale L.J. 1999, 2004 (2011) [hereinafter Breyer, Making Our Democracy Work] (\u201cThe State extended Georgia law over the Cherokee territory, invalidated Cherokee laws, and required that many of those living there sign loyalty oaths to Georgia.\u201d).[\/footnote] Corn Tassel was convicted and sentenced to death. Although the Supreme Court issued a stay of execution, Corn Tassel was hanged.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The Cherokee Nation retained William Wirt, one of the most notable Supreme Court advocates of the day, to represent its interests.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] Although the Nation lost the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it prevailed the following term, winning a judgment that held that the laws of Georgia do not extend to Indian lands.[footnote]See id. The prevailing case is Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832). For an additional academic discussion of the same story, see Barry Friedman, The History of the Countermajoritarian Difficulty: The Road to Judicial Supremacy (pt. 1), 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 333, 395\u201396 (1998).[\/footnote] Justice Stephen Breyer has described the case as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u2003\u2003\u2003Wirt then found the case he was looking for. A New England missionary, Samuel A. Worcester, living in Cherokee territory had refused to sign Georgia\u2019s loyalty oath, and Georgia had jailed him. He could bring Worcester\u2019s case to the Supreme Court by way of appeal, and it was unlikely that Georgia would execute Worcester\u2014a citizen of Vermont\u2014before the Court could decide it. He did appeal.

First, tribes have the exclusive power to regulate protest activity when it occurs in Indian country. This exercise of a tribe\u2019s inherent power applies even on land owned by the state or by nonmembers of the tribe if it occurs within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Second, while a tribe\u2019s exercise of its inherent power to regu\u00adlate these protests is not constrained by the U.S. Constitution, tribal governments should be scrupulous in the imposition of penalties for con\u00adduct which would otherwise be protected by federal law.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To justify these positions, this Piece proceeds in three Parts. Part I defines the places over which tribal regulatory authority is exclusive. It uses the contours of \u201cIndian country\u201d[footnote]\u201cIndian country\u201d is a legal term of art defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 (2018). For additional context, see infra Part II.[\/footnote] to describe the legally defined spaces over which tribal exercise of their inherent regulatory power is greatest and makes clear that these spaces include land owned in fee simple by nonmembers when that land is within the reservation\u2019s boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part II explores the inherent regulatory power of Indian tribes. It builds upon well-established Supreme Court precedent to justify why a tribe\u2019s inherent power to regulate protest activity exists throughout Indian country. Having established that such tribal power exists, it then uses the doctrines of infringement and preemption to explain why states lack con\u00adcurrent regulatory authority, leaving the tribal sovereign as the sole authority to regulate protest activity in Indian country. Part II concludes with a discussion of federal power, recognizing that Congress could impose regulations regarding protest activity on tribal lands but suggesting that it will not do so both because of its stated commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and because its recent legislative history has shown a reticence to impose new federal regulations on Indian tribes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III turns to the tribal sovereign. It explains that tribal govern\u00adments, unlike state or federal governments, are not bound by the U.S. Constitution\u2014including its protections for freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition. Part III then looks at existing tribal regulation and enforcement of protest in Indian country, particularly against tribal members, and cautions tribes to be intentional with the pun\u00adishment of conduct that would otherwise be federally protected.<\/p>",

First, tribes have the exclusive power to regulate protest activity when it occurs in Indian country. This exercise of a tribe\u2019s inherent power applies even on land owned by the state or by nonmembers of the tribe if it occurs within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Second, while a tribe\u2019s exercise of its inherent power to regu\u00adlate these protests is not constrained by the U.S. Constitution, tribal governments should be scrupulous in the imposition of penalties for con\u00adduct which would otherwise be protected by federal law.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To justify these positions, this Piece proceeds in three Parts. Part I defines the places over which tribal regulatory authority is exclusive. It uses the contours of \u201cIndian country\u201d[footnote]\u201cIndian country\u201d is a legal term of art defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01151 (2018). For additional context, see infra Part II.[\/footnote] to describe the legally defined spaces over which tribal exercise of their inherent regulatory power is greatest and makes clear that these spaces include land owned in fee simple by nonmembers when that land is within the reservation\u2019s boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part II explores the inherent regulatory power of Indian tribes. It builds upon well-established Supreme Court precedent to justify why a tribe\u2019s inherent power to regulate protest activity exists throughout Indian country. Having established that such tribal power exists, it then uses the doctrines of infringement and preemption to explain why states lack con\u00adcurrent regulatory authority, leaving the tribal sovereign as the sole authority to regulate protest activity in Indian country. Part II concludes with a discussion of federal power, recognizing that Congress could impose regulations regarding protest activity on tribal lands but suggesting that it will not do so both because of its stated commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and because its recent legislative history has shown a reticence to impose new federal regulations on Indian tribes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part III turns to the tribal sovereign. It explains that tribal govern\u00adments, unlike state or federal governments, are not bound by the U.S. Constitution\u2014including its protections for freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition. Part III then looks at existing tribal regulation and enforcement of protest in Indian country, particularly against tribal members, and cautions tribes to be intentional with the pun\u00adishment of conduct that would otherwise be federally protected.<\/p>",
