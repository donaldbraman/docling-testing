				<p>It is conventional wisdom that the states are free—within wide constitutional parameters—to structure their governments as they want. This Article challenges that received wisdom and argues that the Supreme Court has drawn on an eclectic set of constitutional provisions to develop a broader body of federal constitutional rules of state structure than previously understood.</p>
<p>This Article gathers and systemizes that body of law. It first locates the expected and unexpected constitutional openings onto which federal courts have seized to rule on questions of state structure. The Article then distills the haphazard, often conflicting, and sometimes even bizarre approaches federal courts have used to decide when and why the federal Constitution constrains state structural discretion and what state governance structures it endorses. The Article finally turns to the implications of this body of doctrine for both federalism and federal structural constitutional law. It develops a vocabulary to understand both why these cases have not been incorporated into the federalism canon and the institutional design choices and values they implicate.</p>
<p>Ours is a system of layered constitutionalism, but not one in which each government’s constitutionally chartered structures operate discretely. It is one that contains structural interdependencies between the federal and state constitutional structures. The challenge is to locate structural interdependencies in ways that preserve the values of our system of layered constitutionalism—a challenge, this Article shows, that the Court has not yet met.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Structural disputes are ubiquitous in constitutional law. Constitutions provide a blueprint for government—charting institutions, allocating authority, facilitating coordination, and engineering friction. And although the federal Constitution and all fifty state constitutions establish systems of divided power, they also envision interdependence between their governmental departments—like lawmaking through bicameralism and presentment—which invites both coordination and contestation.</p>
<p>It is therefore unremarkable for the United States Supreme Court to settle a dispute over the scope of executive power or the boundaries between presidential and congressional authority.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 31–32 (2015) (settling a dispute between President’s recognition power and Congress’s passport power); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

 That structural disputes typically play out within the jurisdiction in which they arise is for good reason: How a people structure their own government is one of their most intimate and foundational choices. Indeed, it is a widely accepted principle of American federalism—stated time and again<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		This longstanding principle was expressed at the time of the Founding. See Federalist No. 43, at 275 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (“States may choose to substitute other republican forms . . . . The only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions.”), and continues to be expressed by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Berger v. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2022) (“Within wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish.”); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (“Through the structure of its government . . . a State defines itself as a sovereign.”).	</span>

		Specifically, states cannot structure their governments in manners that violate their residents’ federal constitutional rights; they cannot shield their courts from enforcing federal law consistent with the Supremacy Clause; and they cannot (at least in theory) depart from a basic “republican form of government,” although the constitutional provision imposing that limitation is rarely used. See infra notes 269–271. Part III discusses these exceptions at greater length.	</span>

 For those reasons, the conventional wisdom goes, it would be unusual for a question about the internal structure of Colorado’s or Kansas’s or Oregon’s government to be adjudicated by a federal court, according to federal law, instead of by that state’s own court and guided by its own constitutional plan.</p>
<p>This Article shows, however, that in many different substantive areas, the Supreme Court has elaborated a body of <em>federal</em> constitutional rules that directly and indirectly govern <em>state</em> structure—a set of doctrinal rules more pervasive than previously understood. Indeed, state structural questions play a defining role in a striking range of Supreme Court cases.</p>

<p>But state structural questions also arise in unexpected places: Over the decades, the Court has shaped the course of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence on a matter as significant as the constitutionality of capital punishment. Eighth Amendment “cruel and unusual punishment” doctrine instructs courts to consider whether a punishment conflicts with “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>These cases do not merely nod to state structure on the way to reaching (or, in some cases, not reaching) questions of substantive constitutional law.

		Among others, this Article collects federal rules related to who speaks for the state, how power is allocated among a state’s coordinate branches, what constraints (from lawmaking by bicameralism and presentment to judicial review) those branches are subject to, and what internal form state institutions must take (from the role of referenda and initiatives in state legislative processes, to the committees and commissions legislatures can encompass, to the role of the governor in the lawmaking process).	</span>

 These cases have not yet been drawn together or scrutinized as a common body of doctrine—a form of federal constitutional regulation of state structure. Once this body of federal doctrine of state structure is made visible, its substantive import is clear: How a government is structured and decisionmaking authority is diffused—in other words, institutional design—determines substantive law and substantive outcomes.</p>
<p>This Article uses the terms “regulate” and “rule” to capture the broad ways in which the Court has found the Constitution to speak to state structure. These rules of state structure include mandates (requiring state institutions to function in a federally preferred way), prohibitions (barring states from operating in a federally unpreferred way), taxes (raising the cost of state structural choices), and conditions (conditioning state participation in a federal activity on particular state structural choices).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s siloed and often sui generis treatment of these cases accounts in substantial measure for the lack of coherence to this body of law. Although these rules taken together make up a significant thread of federalism doctrine (and, in turn, shape the federalism dynamic between and among our governments), the Court has never treated them as such, generally omitting considered discussion (and sometimes omitting <em>any</em> discussion) of their federalism stakes.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		For perspective, prominent branches of federalism doctrine have encompassed just a handful of cases and yet invited significant critique and assessment. For example, the anticommandeering rule, a doctrine viewed as highly significant in the federalism world, has been elaborated through just five major cases since it was first recognized in 1992. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 161 (1992) (first recognizing the anticomman-deering principle); see also Haaland v. Brackeen, 143 S. Ct. 1609, 1641 (2023) (holding that the Indian Child Welfare Act does not violate Tenth Amendment’s anticommandeering principle); Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018) (holding that a federal law prohibiting sports gambling violated the anticommandeering principle); Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 151 (2000) (holding that the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act does not violate the anticommandeering principle); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 993 (1997) (holding that Congress could not commandeer state actors to administer background checks during firearm sales).	</span>

<p>This Article, then, tells both a story about the eclectic and unexpected ways that federal constitutional law regulates and speaks to state structural choices and a story about how, in diffuse and often siloed ways, that body of law came to be—how the Constitution creates openings, how the Supreme Court has seized upon them, and how it has embedded often consequential judgments about state structure in plain sight.</p>
<p>Part I shows that a wide range of constitutional provisions create openings—through spare mentions of “the states”; unelaborated invocations of state “legislatures,” “executives,” and “judges”; and provisions governing broad topics like Article III standing and cruel and unusual punishment that seem facially to have little or no connection to federalism or state structure—that the Court has seized to develop doctrine that directly and indirectly regulates state structure.</p>
<p>Part II considers the resulting doctrine together for the first time. It shows that because the constitutional spaces described in Part I do not articulate clear and affirmative constraints on state structure (indeed, many do not seem to speak to state structure at all), the rules the Court has elaborated instead regulate state structure more circuitously by adopting various (sometimes inconsistent) ways to understand the federal Constitution to define what “the state” is, how states must allocate and distribute power, and which institutions count as the state and for what purpose. To that end, the Court has set out constitutional conceptions of the state—and structural blueprints to which its institutions must conform for certain federal purposes—using several techniques.</p>
<p>It analogizes the states to <em>generic republics</em> (that is, to what a federal court believes a state should look like) and then taxes states that do not conform to that template. It requires states to embrace agency relation-ships common in <em>private organizations</em> even when a state constitution embraces a different representative framework. It conceptualizes states as <em>federal adjuncts</em>, detaching them from their state constitutional contexts when performing certain functions and rendering them arms of the federal system (or, in some cases, declining to do so). It attempts a kind of <em>modified deference</em>, mixing together respect for how states have structured their governments with coordinate rules that restrict state discretion. And, at times, it adopts a posture of <em>nonintervention</em>, refusing to take a position on intrastate structural disputes—like who can legally speak for the state—but, in so doing, shaping state structure nonetheless.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 The rules collected here relate to a different design choice: how to legally organize our system’s internal governments. Federalist regimes can, and do, organize their internal governments as administrative organs of the central government, as federal constitutional departments, through corporate charters, or—as in our system—through separate, self-determined constitutions. This Part argues that the choice to structure our constitutional system in the latter manner—to establish what we call a system of <em>layered constitutionalism</em>—deserves more attention.</p>

 But constitutions do not just grant rights; they also chart structures. And the structural implications of America’s layered constitutionalism—which the doctrinal rules this paper implicate—have received far less attention. Most importantly, in our system of layered constitutionalism, those layers are not crisply separated; instead, the rules collected here form what we call <em>structural interdependencies</em>. State institutions are shaped not just by their own constitutions but by the terms and doctrines of the federal Constitution. The question that Part III begins to explore is how deeply these structural interdependencies should run and whether federal courts are suited to the task of making those determinations. It argues that across diverse values that inform the design of a federalist system, state constitutional autonomy serves important functions.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>This body of constitutional law also has implications for questions about federal structural constitutional law, namely in conversations about the Court’s institutional role in designing a body of intersystemic constitutional law through a system of dispute resolution. In forging federal constitutional rules of state structure, the Supreme Court operates at the intersection of two institutionally sensitive areas: federalism and the separation of powers. Through its involvement in what are often heated state political matters—contests between governors and legislatures, state high courts and state agencies—the Court assumes a role of umpire-from-without, blurring the lines between the federal and state systems of government and issuing judgments that choose political winners and losers, not just in the state before the Court but also potentially many others.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

							"articleBody": "<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\r\nStructural disputes are ubiquitous in constitutional law. Constitutions provide a blueprint for government\u2014charting institutions, allocating authority, facilitating coordination, and engineering friction. And although the federal Constitution and all fifty state constitutions establish systems of divided power, they also envision interdependence between their governmental departments\u2014like lawmaking through bicameralism and presentment\u2014which invites both coordination and contestation.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unremarkable for the United States Supreme Court to settle a dispute over the scope of executive power or the boundaries between presidential and congressional authority.[footnote]See, e.g., Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2224 (2020) (holding the CFPB\u2019s for-cause removal structure violates the Executive\u2019s removal authority); Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 31\u201332 (2015) (settling a dispute between President\u2019s recognition power and Congress\u2019s passport power); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585\u201387 (1952) (articulating the power framework when President acts without congressional authority).[\/footnote] And it is likewise unremarkable for a state high court to resolve a disagreement between its legislature and governor.[footnote]See, e.g., Brewer v. Burns, 213 P.3d 671, 673 (Ariz. 2009) (resolving a dispute brought by governor to compel legislature to present budget bills); Nate v. Denney, 464 P.3d 287, 288 (Idaho 2017) (resolving a dispute brought by the legislature to compel the secretary of state to certify a state bill); Op. of the Justs., 123 A.3d 494, 497 (Me. 2015) (providing an advisory opinion sought by governor as to legal effect of certain bills); In re Request of Governor Janklow, 615 N.W.2d 618, 619 (S.D. 2000) (providing an advisory opinion sought regarding the effect of gubernatorial vetoes); In re Turner, 627 S.W.3d 654, 656 (Tex. 2021) (resolving a dispute brought by state legislature over governor\u2019s veto power).[\/footnote] That structural disputes typically play out within the jurisdiction in which they arise is for good reason: How a people structure their own government is one of their most intimate and foundational choices. Indeed, it is a widely accepted principle of American federalism\u2014stated time and again[footnote]This longstanding principle was expressed at the time of the Founding. See Federalist No. 43, at 275 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (\u201cStates may choose to substitute other republican forms\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions.\u201d), and continues to be expressed by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Berger v. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2022) (\u201cWithin wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cThrough the structure of its government\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a State defines itself as a sovereign.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014that the states are free to structure their governments as they see fit, subject to several settled constitutional parameters.[footnote]Specifically, states cannot structure their governments in manners that violate their residents\u2019 federal constitutional rights; they cannot shield their courts from enforcing federal law consistent with the Supremacy Clause; and they cannot (at least in theory) depart from a basic \u201crepublican form of government,\u201d although the constitutional provision imposing that limitation is rarely used. See infra notes 269\u2013271. Part III discusses these exceptions at greater length.[\/footnote] For those reasons, the conventional wisdom goes, it would be unusual for a question about the internal structure of Colorado\u2019s or Kansas\u2019s or Oregon\u2019s government to be adjudicated by a federal court, according to federal law, instead of by that state\u2019s own court and guided by its own constitutional plan.\r\n\r\nThis Article shows, however, that in many different substantive areas, the Supreme Court has elaborated a body of <em>federal<\/em> constitutional rules that directly and indirectly govern <em>state<\/em> structure\u2014a set of doctrinal rules more pervasive than previously understood. Indeed, state structural questions play a defining role in a striking range of Supreme Court cases.\r\n\r\nTo name just a few: <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]570 U.S. 693 (2013).[\/footnote] set up a ruling on the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. But the Court instead dismissed the case for lack of standing, reasoning that, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the state had not authorized initiative proponents to represent \u201cthe state\u201d in federal court.[footnote]Id. at 701.[\/footnote] Just last term, by contrast, in <em>Biden v. Nebraska<\/em>,[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023).[\/footnote] the Court allowed a challenge to the President\u2019s student loan discharge policy to proceed, concluding that the state of Missouri could claim fiscal injuries suffered by a quasi-public corporation as \u201cthe state\u2019s\u201d\u2014notwithstanding the corporation\u2019s own decision to remain out of the lawsuit.[footnote]Id. at 2366.[\/footnote] Last term, too, the Court decided <em>Moore v. Harper<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2065 (2023).[\/footnote] by resolving a percolating ambiguity about how the federal Constitution understands the role of state \u201clegislatures\u201d in regulating elections.\r\n\r\nBut state structural questions also arise in unexpected places: Over the decades, the Court has shaped the course of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence on a matter as significant as the constitutionality of capital punishment. Eighth Amendment \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d doctrine instructs courts to consider whether a punishment conflicts with \u201cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d[footnote]Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 269\u201370 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).[\/footnote] The Court has disproportionally relied on statutes enacted by state legislatures to give content to those evolving views, while dismissing or minimizing the relevance of views expressed through other state actors who\u2014pursuant to state constitutional or statutory law\u2014also express state policy on questions of punishment.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote] And the cases about state structure that this Article identifies reach broader still, to areas ranging from sovereign immunity, to constitutional amendments, to how the Court decides who speaks for the state on the shadow docket.\r\n\r\nThese cases do not merely nod to state structure on the way to reaching (or, in some cases, not reaching) questions of substantive constitutional law. They pronounce upon basic state structural questions that are ordinarily the province of state constitutional drafters.[footnote]Among others, this Article collects federal rules related to who speaks for the state, how power is allocated among a state\u2019s coordinate branches, what constraints (from lawmaking by bicameralism and presentment to judicial review) those branches are subject to, and what internal form state institutions must take (from the role of referenda and initiatives in state legislative processes, to the committees and commissions legislatures can encompass, to the role of the governor in the lawmaking process).[\/footnote] These cases have not yet been drawn together or scrutinized as a common body of doctrine\u2014a form of federal constitutional regulation of state structure. Once this body of federal doctrine of state structure is made visible, its substantive import is clear: How a government is structured and decisionmaking authority is diffused\u2014in other words, institutional design\u2014determines substantive law and substantive outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis Article uses the terms \u201cregulate\u201d and \u201crule\u201d to capture the broad ways in which the Court has found the Constitution to speak to state structure. These rules of state structure include mandates (requiring state institutions to function in a federally preferred way), prohibitions (barring states from operating in a federally unpreferred way), taxes (raising the cost of state structural choices), and conditions (conditioning state participation in a federal activity on particular state structural choices).\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s siloed and often sui generis treatment of these cases accounts in substantial measure for the lack of coherence to this body of law. Although these rules taken together make up a significant thread of federalism doctrine (and, in turn, shape the federalism dynamic between and among our governments), the Court has never treated them as such, generally omitting considered discussion (and sometimes omitting <em>any<\/em> discussion) of their federalism stakes.[footnote]For perspective, prominent branches of federalism doctrine have encompassed just a handful of cases and yet invited significant critique and assessment. For example, the anticommandeering rule, a doctrine viewed as highly significant in the federalism world, has been elaborated through just five major cases since it was first recognized in 1992. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 161 (1992) (first recognizing the anticomman-deering principle); see also Haaland v. Brackeen, 143 S. Ct. 1609, 1641 (2023) (holding that the Indian Child Welfare Act does not violate Tenth Amendment\u2019s anticommandeering principle); Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018) (holding that a federal law prohibiting sports gambling violated the anticommandeering principle); Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 151 (2000) (holding that the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act does not violate the anticommandeering principle); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 993 (1997) (holding that Congress could not commandeer state actors to administer background checks during firearm sales).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Article, then, tells both a story about the eclectic and unexpected ways that federal constitutional law regulates and speaks to state structural choices and a story about how, in diffuse and often siloed ways, that body of law came to be\u2014how the Constitution creates openings, how the Supreme Court has seized upon them, and how it has embedded often consequential judgments about state structure in plain sight.\r\n\r\nPart I shows that a wide range of constitutional provisions create openings\u2014through spare mentions of \u201cthe states\u201d; unelaborated invocations of state \u201clegislatures,\u201d \u201cexecutives,\u201d and \u201cjudges\u201d; and provisions governing broad topics like Article III standing and cruel and unusual punishment that seem facially to have little or no connection to federalism or state structure\u2014that the Court has seized to develop doctrine that directly and indirectly regulates state structure.\r\n\r\nPart II considers the resulting doctrine together for the first time. It shows that because the constitutional spaces described in Part I do not articulate clear and affirmative constraints on state structure (indeed, many do not seem to speak to state structure at all), the rules the Court has elaborated instead regulate state structure more circuitously by adopting various (sometimes inconsistent) ways to understand the federal Constitution to define what \u201cthe state\u201d is, how states must allocate and distribute power, and which institutions count as the state and for what purpose. To that end, the Court has set out constitutional conceptions of the state\u2014and structural blueprints to which its institutions must conform for certain federal purposes\u2014using several techniques.\r\n\r\nIt analogizes the states to <em>generic republics<\/em> (that is, to what a federal court believes a state should look like) and then taxes states that do not conform to that template. It requires states to embrace agency relation-ships common in <em>private organizations<\/em> even when a state constitution embraces a different representative framework. It conceptualizes states as <em>federal adjuncts<\/em>, detaching them from their state constitutional contexts when performing certain functions and rendering them arms of the federal system (or, in some cases, declining to do so). It attempts a kind of <em>modified deference<\/em>, mixing together respect for how states have structured their governments with coordinate rules that restrict state discretion. And, at times, it adopts a posture of <em>nonintervention<\/em>, refusing to take a position on intrastate structural disputes\u2014like who can legally speak for the state\u2014but, in so doing, shaping state structure nonetheless.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nConsidered together, these cases yield an untidy, inconsistent, and sometimes haphazard conception of \u201cthe state\u201d and of the legal tenets that ground its structure. And because, as Part II further reveals, the Court frequently lacks a vocabulary for expounding the federalism stakes of this form of state structural regulation, these cases are peppered with undefended assumptions and unjustified references to federalism-orienting principles.\r\n\r\nPart III places this body of rules in context and begins to frame its implications for federalism and for federal structural constitutional law. Federalism doctrine and scholarship tend to focus on three design features of our federalist system: its boundaries, its jurisdictional distributions, and (more recently) its \u201crules of engagement.\u201d[footnote]See infra section III.A. Federalism scholarship, of course, also engages a vivid federalism world that exists outside of doctrinal reach that documents the many subconstitutional forms of federal\u2013state engagement. See sources cited infra notes 277\u2013283.[\/footnote] The rules collected here relate to a different design choice: how to legally organize our system\u2019s internal governments. Federalist regimes can, and do, organize their internal governments as administrative organs of the central government, as federal constitutional departments, through corporate charters, or\u2014as in our system\u2014through separate, self-determined constitutions.

State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2022) (\u201cWithin wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cThrough the structure of its government\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a State defines itself as a sovereign.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014that the states are free to structure their governments as they see fit, subject to several settled constitutional parameters.[footnote]Specifically, states cannot structure their governments in manners that violate their residents\u2019 federal constitutional rights; they cannot shield their courts from enforcing federal law consistent with the Supremacy Clause; and they cannot (at least in theory) depart from a basic \u201crepublican form of government,\u201d although the constitutional provision imposing that limitation is rarely used. See infra notes 269\u2013271. Part III discusses these exceptions at greater length.[\/footnote] For those reasons, the conventional wisdom goes, it would be unusual for a question about the internal structure of Colorado\u2019s or Kansas\u2019s or Oregon\u2019s government to be adjudicated by a federal court, according to federal law, instead of by that state\u2019s own court and guided by its own constitutional plan.\r\n\r\nThis Article shows, however, that in many different substantive areas, the Supreme Court has elaborated a body of <em>federal<\/em> constitutional rules that directly and indirectly govern <em>state<\/em> structure\u2014a set of doctrinal rules more pervasive than previously understood. Indeed, state structural questions play a defining role in a striking range of Supreme Court cases.\r\n\r\nTo name just a few: <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]570 U.S. 693 (2013).[\/footnote] set up a ruling on the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. But the Court instead dismissed the case for lack of standing, reasoning that, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the state had not authorized initiative proponents to represent \u201cthe state\u201d in federal court.[footnote]Id. at 701.[\/footnote] Just last term, by contrast, in <em>Biden v. Nebraska<\/em>,[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023).[\/footnote] the Court allowed a challenge to the President\u2019s student loan discharge policy to proceed, concluding that the state of Missouri could claim fiscal injuries suffered by a quasi-public corporation as \u201cthe state\u2019s\u201d\u2014notwithstanding the corporation\u2019s own decision to remain out of the lawsuit.[footnote]Id. at 2366.[\/footnote] Last term, too, the Court decided <em>Moore v. Harper<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2065 (2023).[\/footnote] by resolving a percolating ambiguity about how the federal Constitution understands the role of state \u201clegislatures\u201d in regulating elections.\r\n\r\nBut state structural questions also arise in unexpected places: Over the decades, the Court has shaped the course of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence on a matter as significant as the constitutionality of capital punishment. Eighth Amendment \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d doctrine instructs courts to consider whether a punishment conflicts with \u201cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d[footnote]Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 269\u201370 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).[\/footnote] The Court has disproportionally relied on statutes enacted by state legislatures to give content to those evolving views, while dismissing or minimizing the relevance of views expressed through other state actors who\u2014pursuant to state constitutional or statutory law\u2014also express state policy on questions of punishment.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote] And the cases about state structure that this Article identifies reach broader still, to areas ranging from sovereign immunity, to constitutional amendments, to how the Court decides who speaks for the state on the shadow docket.\r\n\r\nThese cases do not merely nod to state structure on the way to reaching (or, in some cases, not reaching) questions of substantive constitutional law. They pronounce upon basic state structural questions that are ordinarily the province of state constitutional drafters.[footnote]Among others, this Article collects federal rules related to who speaks for the state, how power is allocated among a state\u2019s coordinate branches, what constraints (from lawmaking by bicameralism and presentment to judicial review) those branches are subject to, and what internal form state institutions must take (from the role of referenda and initiatives in state legislative processes, to the committees and commissions legislatures can encompass, to the role of the governor in the lawmaking process).[\/footnote] These cases have not yet been drawn together or scrutinized as a common body of doctrine\u2014a form of federal constitutional regulation of state structure. Once this body of federal doctrine of state structure is made visible, its substantive import is clear: How a government is structured and decisionmaking authority is diffused\u2014in other words, institutional design\u2014determines substantive law and substantive outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis Article uses the terms \u201cregulate\u201d and \u201crule\u201d to capture the broad ways in which the Court has found the Constitution to speak to state structure. These rules of state structure include mandates (requiring state institutions to function in a federally preferred way), prohibitions (barring states from operating in a federally unpreferred way), taxes (raising the cost of state structural choices), and conditions (conditioning state participation in a federal activity on particular state structural choices).\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s siloed and often sui generis treatment of these cases accounts in substantial measure for the lack of coherence to this body of law. Although these rules taken together make up a significant thread of federalism doctrine (and, in turn, shape the federalism dynamic between and among our governments), the Court has never treated them as such, generally omitting considered discussion (and sometimes omitting <em>any<\/em> discussion) of their federalism stakes.[footnote]For perspective, prominent branches of federalism doctrine have encompassed just a handful of cases and yet invited significant critique and assessment. For example, the anticommandeering rule, a doctrine viewed as highly significant in the federalism world, has been elaborated through just five major cases since it was first recognized in 1992. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 161 (1992) (first recognizing the anticomman-deering principle); see also Haaland v. Brackeen, 143 S. Ct. 1609, 1641 (2023) (holding that the Indian Child Welfare Act does not violate Tenth Amendment\u2019s anticommandeering principle); Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018) (holding that a federal law prohibiting sports gambling violated the anticommandeering principle); Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 151 (2000) (holding that the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act does not violate the anticommandeering principle); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 993 (1997) (holding that Congress could not commandeer state actors to administer background checks during firearm sales).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Article, then, tells both a story about the eclectic and unexpected ways that federal constitutional law regulates and speaks to state structural choices and a story about how, in diffuse and often siloed ways, that body of law came to be\u2014how the Constitution creates openings, how the Supreme Court has seized upon them, and how it has embedded often consequential judgments about state structure in plain sight.\r\n\r\nPart I shows that a wide range of constitutional provisions create openings\u2014through spare mentions of \u201cthe states\u201d; unelaborated invocations of state \u201clegislatures,\u201d \u201cexecutives,\u201d and \u201cjudges\u201d; and provisions governing broad topics like Article III standing and cruel and unusual punishment that seem facially to have little or no connection to federalism or state structure\u2014that the Court has seized to develop doctrine that directly and indirectly regulates state structure.\r\n\r\nPart II considers the resulting doctrine together for the first time. It shows that because the constitutional spaces described in Part I do not articulate clear and affirmative constraints on state structure (indeed, many do not seem to speak to state structure at all), the rules the Court has elaborated instead regulate state structure more circuitously by adopting various (sometimes inconsistent) ways to understand the federal Constitution to define what \u201cthe state\u201d is, how states must allocate and distribute power, and which institutions count as the state and for what purpose. To that end, the Court has set out constitutional conceptions of the state\u2014and structural blueprints to which its institutions must conform for certain federal purposes\u2014using several techniques.\r\n\r\nIt analogizes the states to <em>generic republics<\/em> (that is, to what a federal court believes a state should look like) and then taxes states that do not conform to that template. It requires states to embrace agency relation-ships common in <em>private organizations<\/em> even when a state constitution embraces a different representative framework. It conceptualizes states as <em>federal adjuncts<\/em>, detaching them from their state constitutional contexts when performing certain functions and rendering them arms of the federal system (or, in some cases, declining to do so). It attempts a kind of <em>modified deference<\/em>, mixing together respect for how states have structured their governments with coordinate rules that restrict state discretion. And, at times, it adopts a posture of <em>nonintervention<\/em>, refusing to take a position on intrastate structural disputes\u2014like who can legally speak for the state\u2014but, in so doing, shaping state structure nonetheless.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nConsidered together, these cases yield an untidy, inconsistent, and sometimes haphazard conception of \u201cthe state\u201d and of the legal tenets that ground its structure. And because, as Part II further reveals, the Court frequently lacks a vocabulary for expounding the federalism stakes of this form of state structural regulation, these cases are peppered with undefended assumptions and unjustified references to federalism-orienting principles.\r\n\r\nPart III places this body of rules in context and begins to frame its implications for federalism and for federal structural constitutional law. Federalism doctrine and scholarship tend to focus on three design features of our federalist system: its boundaries, its jurisdictional distributions, and (more recently) its \u201crules of engagement.\u201d[footnote]See infra section III.A. Federalism scholarship, of course, also engages a vivid federalism world that exists outside of doctrinal reach that documents the many subconstitutional forms of federal\u2013state engagement. See sources cited infra notes 277\u2013283.[\/footnote] The rules collected here relate to a different design choice: how to legally organize our system\u2019s internal governments. Federalist regimes can, and do, organize their internal governments as administrative organs of the central government, as federal constitutional departments, through corporate charters, or\u2014as in our system\u2014through separate, self-determined constitutions. This Part argues that the choice to structure our constitutional system in the latter manner\u2014to establish what we call a system of <em>layered constitutionalism<\/em>\u2014deserves more attention.\r\n\r\nThe implications of that choice for individual rights have been amply plumbed.[footnote]Justice William Brennan was widely credited with reinvigorating interest in state constitutions as a second layer of protection for individual rights, see William J. Brennan, Jr., State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 503 (1977) [hereinafter Brennan, State Constitutions], which spawned\u2014in turn\u2014an enormous body of scholarship. See sources cited infra notes 240 &amp; 242.[\/footnote] But constitutions do not just grant rights; they also chart structures. And the structural implications of America\u2019s layered constitutionalism\u2014which the doctrinal rules this paper implicate\u2014have received far less attention. Most importantly, in our system of layered constitutionalism, those layers are not crisply separated; instead, the rules collected here form what we call <em>structural interdependencies<\/em>. State institutions are shaped not just by their own constitutions but by the terms and doctrines of the federal Constitution. The question that Part III begins to explore is how deeply these structural interdependencies should run and whether federal courts are suited to the task of making those determinations. It argues that across diverse values that inform the design of a federalist system, state constitutional autonomy serves important functions.[footnote]See infra section III.B.[\/footnote] If one subscribes (as the Supreme Court has) to traditional federalism values\u2014such as dual sovereignty\u2014then the value of outwardly reasoning and considering state structural autonomy is self-evident.\r\n\r\nBut for contemporary federalism scholarship, the argument is perhaps surprising. Contemporary federalism, in a wide range of other areas\u2014from politics, to joint programs, to cross-governmental acts of lawmaking and rulemaking\u2014celebrates the porousness and intermeshing of federal and state governments.[footnote]See infra section III.B.2.[\/footnote] This Article argues that even for those scholars (one of us among them) who would \u201cshear[] [federalism] of sovereignty\u201d[footnote]Heather K. Gerken, The Supreme Court, 2009 Term\u2014Foreword: Federalism All the Way Down, 124 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 14 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).[\/footnote]\u2014and allow the states and federal government to energet-ically negotiate and renegotiate their policy jurisdiction\u2014constitutional autonomy is the formalist <em>in<\/em>dependence that these many forms of functional <em>inter<\/em>dependence need to flourish.[footnote]See Bridget A. Fahey, Federalism by Contract, 129 Yale L.J. 2326, 2415\u201316 (2020) [hereinafter Fahey, Federalism by Contract] (\u201cThere are good reasons to \u2018shear\u2019 federalism of the reflexive sovereignty-as-separation recited over and again in Supreme Court cases.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis body of constitutional law also has implications for questions about federal structural constitutional law, namely in conversations about the Court\u2019s institutional role in designing a body of intersystemic constitutional law through a system of dispute resolution. In forging federal constitutional rules of state structure, the Supreme Court operates at the intersection of two institutionally sensitive areas: federalism and the separation of powers. Through its involvement in what are often heated state political matters\u2014contests between governors and legislatures, state high courts and state agencies\u2014the Court assumes a role of umpire-from-without, blurring the lines between the federal and state systems of government and issuing judgments that choose political winners and losers, not just in the state before the Court but also potentially many others.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote] The Court\u2019s failure to produce a consistent and reasoned body of law in this complex structural terrain suggests that it has yet to develop the tools necessary to manage the sensitivities of this distinctive intersystemic structural intersection.",

Constitutions provide a blueprint for government\u2014charting institutions, allocating authority, facilitating coordination, and engineering friction. And although the federal Constitution and all fifty state constitutions establish systems of divided power, they also envision interdependence between their governmental departments\u2014like lawmaking through bicameralism and presentment\u2014which invites both coordination and contestation.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unremarkable for the United States Supreme Court to settle a dispute over the scope of executive power or the boundaries between presidential and congressional authority.[footnote]See, e.g., Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2224 (2020) (holding the CFPB\u2019s for-cause removal structure violates the Executive\u2019s removal authority); Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 31\u201332 (2015) (settling a dispute between President\u2019s recognition power and Congress\u2019s passport power); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585\u201387 (1952) (articulating the power framework when President acts without congressional authority).[\/footnote] And it is likewise unremarkable for a state high court to resolve a disagreement between its legislature and governor.[footnote]See, e.g., Brewer v. Burns, 213 P.3d 671, 673 (Ariz. 2009) (resolving a dispute brought by governor to compel legislature to present budget bills); Nate v. Denney, 464 P.3d 287, 288 (Idaho 2017) (resolving a dispute brought by the legislature to compel the secretary of state to certify a state bill); Op. of the Justs., 123 A.3d 494, 497 (Me. 2015) (providing an advisory opinion sought by governor as to legal effect of certain bills); In re Request of Governor Janklow, 615 N.W.2d 618, 619 (S.D. 2000) (providing an advisory opinion sought regarding the effect of gubernatorial vetoes); In re Turner, 627 S.W.3d 654, 656 (Tex. 2021) (resolving a dispute brought by state legislature over governor\u2019s veto power).[\/footnote] That structural disputes typically play out within the jurisdiction in which they arise is for good reason: How a people structure their own government is one of their most intimate and foundational choices. Indeed, it is a widely accepted principle of American federalism\u2014stated time and again[footnote]This longstanding principle was expressed at the time of the Founding. See Federalist No. 43, at 275 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (\u201cStates may choose to substitute other republican forms\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions.\u201d), and continues to be expressed by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Berger v. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2022) (\u201cWithin wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cThrough the structure of its government\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a State defines itself as a sovereign.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014that the states are free to structure their governments as they see fit, subject to several settled constitutional parameters.[footnote]Specifically, states cannot structure their governments in manners that violate their residents\u2019 federal constitutional rights; they cannot shield their courts from enforcing federal law consistent with the Supremacy Clause; and they cannot (at least in theory) depart from a basic \u201crepublican form of government,\u201d although the constitutional provision imposing that limitation is rarely used. See infra notes 269\u2013271. Part III discusses these exceptions at greater length.[\/footnote] For those reasons, the conventional wisdom goes, it would be unusual for a question about the internal structure of Colorado\u2019s or Kansas\u2019s or Oregon\u2019s government to be adjudicated by a federal court, according to federal law, instead of by that state\u2019s own court and guided by its own constitutional plan.\r\n\r\nThis Article shows, however, that in many different substantive areas, the Supreme Court has elaborated a body of <em>federal<\/em> constitutional rules that directly and indirectly govern <em>state<\/em> structure\u2014a set of doctrinal rules more pervasive than previously understood.

Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).[\/footnote] The Court has disproportionally relied on statutes enacted by state legislatures to give content to those evolving views, while dismissing or minimizing the relevance of views expressed through other state actors who\u2014pursuant to state constitutional or statutory law\u2014also express state policy on questions of punishment.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote] And the cases about state structure that this Article identifies reach broader still, to areas ranging from sovereign immunity, to constitutional amendments, to how the Court decides who speaks for the state on the shadow docket.\r\n\r\nThese cases do not merely nod to state structure on the way to reaching (or, in some cases, not reaching) questions of substantive constitutional law. They pronounce upon basic state structural questions that are ordinarily the province of state constitutional drafters.[footnote]Among others, this Article collects federal rules related to who speaks for the state, how power is allocated among a state\u2019s coordinate branches, what constraints (from lawmaking by bicameralism and presentment to judicial review) those branches are subject to, and what internal form state institutions must take (from the role of referenda and initiatives in state legislative processes, to the committees and commissions legislatures can encompass, to the role of the governor in the lawmaking process).[\/footnote] These cases have not yet been drawn together or scrutinized as a common body of doctrine\u2014a form of federal constitutional regulation of state structure. Once this body of federal doctrine of state structure is made visible, its substantive import is clear: How a government is structured and decisionmaking authority is diffused\u2014in other words, institutional design\u2014determines substantive law and substantive outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis Article uses the terms \u201cregulate\u201d and \u201crule\u201d to capture the broad ways in which the Court has found the Constitution to speak to state structure. These rules of state structure include mandates (requiring state institutions to function in a federally preferred way), prohibitions (barring states from operating in a federally unpreferred way), taxes (raising the cost of state structural choices), and conditions (conditioning state participation in a federal activity on particular state structural choices).\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s siloed and often sui generis treatment of these cases accounts in substantial measure for the lack of coherence to this body of law. Although these rules taken together make up a significant thread of federalism doctrine (and, in turn, shape the federalism dynamic between and among our governments), the Court has never treated them as such, generally omitting considered discussion (and sometimes omitting <em>any<\/em> discussion) of their federalism stakes.[footnote]For perspective, prominent branches of federalism doctrine have encompassed just a handful of cases and yet invited significant critique and assessment. For example, the anticommandeering rule, a doctrine viewed as highly significant in the federalism world, has been elaborated through just five major cases since it was first recognized in 1992. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 161 (1992) (first recognizing the anticomman-deering principle); see also Haaland v. Brackeen, 143 S. Ct. 1609, 1641 (2023) (holding that the Indian Child Welfare Act does not violate Tenth Amendment\u2019s anticommandeering principle); Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018) (holding that a federal law prohibiting sports gambling violated the anticommandeering principle); Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 151 (2000) (holding that the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act does not violate the anticommandeering principle); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 993 (1997) (holding that Congress could not commandeer state actors to administer background checks during firearm sales).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Article, then, tells both a story about the eclectic and unexpected ways that federal constitutional law regulates and speaks to state structural choices and a story about how, in diffuse and often siloed ways, that body of law came to be\u2014how the Constitution creates openings, how the Supreme Court has seized upon them, and how it has embedded often consequential judgments about state structure in plain sight.\r\n\r\nPart I shows that a wide range of constitutional provisions create openings\u2014through spare mentions of \u201cthe states\u201d; unelaborated invocations of state \u201clegislatures,\u201d \u201cexecutives,\u201d and \u201cjudges\u201d; and provisions governing broad topics like Article III standing and cruel and unusual punishment that seem facially to have little or no connection to federalism or state structure\u2014that the Court has seized to develop doctrine that directly and indirectly regulates state structure.\r\n\r\nPart II considers the resulting doctrine together for the first time. It shows that because the constitutional spaces described in Part I do not articulate clear and affirmative constraints on state structure (indeed, many do not seem to speak to state structure at all), the rules the Court has elaborated instead regulate state structure more circuitously by adopting various (sometimes inconsistent) ways to understand the federal Constitution to define what \u201cthe state\u201d is, how states must allocate and distribute power, and which institutions count as the state and for what purpose. To that end, the Court has set out constitutional conceptions of the state\u2014and structural blueprints to which its institutions must conform for certain federal purposes\u2014using several techniques.\r\n\r\nIt analogizes the states to <em>generic republics<\/em> (that is, to what a federal court believes a state should look like) and then taxes states that do not conform to that template. It requires states to embrace agency relation-ships common in <em>private organizations<\/em> even when a state constitution embraces a different representative framework. It conceptualizes states as <em>federal adjuncts<\/em>, detaching them from their state constitutional contexts when performing certain functions and rendering them arms of the federal system (or, in some cases, declining to do so). It attempts a kind of <em>modified deference<\/em>, mixing together respect for how states have structured their governments with coordinate rules that restrict state discretion. And, at times, it adopts a posture of <em>nonintervention<\/em>, refusing to take a position on intrastate structural disputes\u2014like who can legally speak for the state\u2014but, in so doing, shaping state structure nonetheless.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nConsidered together, these cases yield an untidy, inconsistent, and sometimes haphazard conception of \u201cthe state\u201d and of the legal tenets that ground its structure. And because, as Part II further reveals, the Court frequently lacks a vocabulary for expounding the federalism stakes of this form of state structural regulation, these cases are peppered with undefended assumptions and unjustified references to federalism-orienting principles.\r\n\r\nPart III places this body of rules in context and begins to frame its implications for federalism and for federal structural constitutional law. Federalism doctrine and scholarship tend to focus on three design features of our federalist system: its boundaries, its jurisdictional distributions, and (more recently) its \u201crules of engagement.\u201d[footnote]See infra section III.A. Federalism scholarship, of course, also engages a vivid federalism world that exists outside of doctrinal reach that documents the many subconstitutional forms of federal\u2013state engagement. See sources cited infra notes 277\u2013283.[\/footnote] The rules collected here relate to a different design choice: how to legally organize our system\u2019s internal governments. Federalist regimes can, and do, organize their internal governments as administrative organs of the central government, as federal constitutional departments, through corporate charters, or\u2014as in our system\u2014through separate, self-determined constitutions. This Part argues that the choice to structure our constitutional system in the latter manner\u2014to establish what we call a system of <em>layered constitutionalism<\/em>\u2014deserves more attention.\r\n\r\nThe implications of that choice for individual rights have been amply plumbed.[footnote]Justice William Brennan was widely credited with reinvigorating interest in state constitutions as a second layer of protection for individual rights, see William J. Brennan, Jr., State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 503 (1977) [hereinafter Brennan, State Constitutions], which spawned\u2014in turn\u2014an enormous body of scholarship. See sources cited infra notes 240 &amp; 242.[\/footnote] But constitutions do not just grant rights; they also chart structures. And the structural implications of America\u2019s layered constitutionalism\u2014which the doctrinal rules this paper implicate\u2014have received far less attention. Most importantly, in our system of layered constitutionalism, those layers are not crisply separated; instead, the rules collected here form what we call <em>structural interdependencies<\/em>. State institutions are shaped not just by their own constitutions but by the terms and doctrines of the federal Constitution. The question that Part III begins to explore is how deeply these structural interdependencies should run and whether federal courts are suited to the task of making those determinations. It argues that across diverse values that inform the design of a federalist system, state constitutional autonomy serves important functions.[footnote]See infra section III.B.[\/footnote] If one subscribes (as the Supreme Court has) to traditional federalism values\u2014such as dual sovereignty\u2014then the value of outwardly reasoning and considering state structural autonomy is self-evident.\r\n\r\nBut for contemporary federalism scholarship, the argument is perhaps surprising. Contemporary federalism, in a wide range of other areas\u2014from politics, to joint programs, to cross-governmental acts of lawmaking and rulemaking\u2014celebrates the porousness and intermeshing of federal and state governments.[footnote]See infra section III.B.2.[\/footnote] This Article argues that even for those scholars (one of us among them) who would \u201cshear[] [federalism] of sovereignty\u201d[footnote]Heather K.

In forging federal constitutional rules of state structure, the Supreme Court operates at the intersection of two institutionally sensitive areas: federalism and the separation of powers. Through its involvement in what are often heated state political matters\u2014contests between governors and legislatures, state high courts and state agencies\u2014the Court assumes a role of umpire-from-without, blurring the lines between the federal and state systems of government and issuing judgments that choose political winners and losers, not just in the state before the Court but also potentially many others.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote] The Court\u2019s failure to produce a consistent and reasoned body of law in this complex structural terrain suggests that it has yet to develop the tools necessary to manage the sensitivities of this distinctive intersystemic structural intersection.",
			"text": "<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\r\nStructural disputes are ubiquitous in constitutional law. Constitutions provide a blueprint for government\u2014charting institutions, allocating authority, facilitating coordination, and engineering friction. And although the federal Constitution and all fifty state constitutions establish systems of divided power, they also envision interdependence between their governmental departments\u2014like lawmaking through bicameralism and presentment\u2014which invites both coordination and contestation.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unremarkable for the United States Supreme Court to settle a dispute over the scope of executive power or the boundaries between presidential and congressional authority.[footnote]See, e.g., Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2224 (2020) (holding the CFPB\u2019s for-cause removal structure violates the Executive\u2019s removal authority); Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 31\u201332 (2015) (settling a dispute between President\u2019s recognition power and Congress\u2019s passport power); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585\u201387 (1952) (articulating the power framework when President acts without congressional authority).[\/footnote] And it is likewise unremarkable for a state high court to resolve a disagreement between its legislature and governor.[footnote]See, e.g., Brewer v. Burns, 213 P.3d 671, 673 (Ariz. 2009) (resolving a dispute brought by governor to compel legislature to present budget bills); Nate v. Denney, 464 P.3d 287, 288 (Idaho 2017) (resolving a dispute brought by the legislature to compel the secretary of state to certify a state bill); Op. of the Justs., 123 A.3d 494, 497 (Me. 2015) (providing an advisory opinion sought by governor as to legal effect of certain bills); In re Request of Governor Janklow, 615 N.W.2d 618, 619 (S.D. 2000) (providing an advisory opinion sought regarding the effect of gubernatorial vetoes); In re Turner, 627 S.W.3d 654, 656 (Tex. 2021) (resolving a dispute brought by state legislature over governor\u2019s veto power).[\/footnote] That structural disputes typically play out within the jurisdiction in which they arise is for good reason: How a people structure their own government is one of their most intimate and foundational choices. Indeed, it is a widely accepted principle of American federalism\u2014stated time and again[footnote]This longstanding principle was expressed at the time of the Founding. See Federalist No. 43, at 275 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (\u201cStates may choose to substitute other republican forms\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions.\u201d), and continues to be expressed by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Berger v. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2022) (\u201cWithin wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cThrough the structure of its government\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a State defines itself as a sovereign.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014that the states are free to structure their governments as they see fit, subject to several settled constitutional parameters.[footnote]Specifically, states cannot structure their governments in manners that violate their residents\u2019 federal constitutional rights; they cannot shield their courts from enforcing federal law consistent with the Supremacy Clause; and they cannot (at least in theory) depart from a basic \u201crepublican form of government,\u201d although the constitutional provision imposing that limitation is rarely used. See infra notes 269\u2013271. Part III discusses these exceptions at greater length.[\/footnote] For those reasons, the conventional wisdom goes, it would be unusual for a question about the internal structure of Colorado\u2019s or Kansas\u2019s or Oregon\u2019s government to be adjudicated by a federal court, according to federal law, instead of by that state\u2019s own court and guided by its own constitutional plan.\r\n\r\nThis Article shows, however, that in many different substantive areas, the Supreme Court has elaborated a body of <em>federal<\/em> constitutional rules that directly and indirectly govern <em>state<\/em> structure\u2014a set of doctrinal rules more pervasive than previously understood. Indeed, state structural questions play a defining role in a striking range of Supreme Court cases.\r\n\r\nTo name just a few: <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]570 U.S. 693 (2013).[\/footnote] set up a ruling on the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. But the Court instead dismissed the case for lack of standing, reasoning that, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the state had not authorized initiative proponents to represent \u201cthe state\u201d in federal court.[footnote]Id. at 701.[\/footnote] Just last term, by contrast, in <em>Biden v. Nebraska<\/em>,[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023).[\/footnote] the Court allowed a challenge to the President\u2019s student loan discharge policy to proceed, concluding that the state of Missouri could claim fiscal injuries suffered by a quasi-public corporation as \u201cthe state\u2019s\u201d\u2014notwithstanding the corporation\u2019s own decision to remain out of the lawsuit.[footnote]Id. at 2366.[\/footnote] Last term, too, the Court decided <em>Moore v. Harper<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>[footnote]143 S. Ct. 2065 (2023).[\/footnote] by resolving a percolating ambiguity about how the federal Constitution understands the role of state \u201clegislatures\u201d in regulating elections.\r\n\r\nBut state structural questions also arise in unexpected places: Over the decades, the Court has shaped the course of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence on a matter as significant as the constitutionality of capital punishment. Eighth Amendment \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d doctrine instructs courts to consider whether a punishment conflicts with \u201cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d[footnote]Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 269\u201370 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).[\/footnote] The Court has disproportionally relied on statutes enacted by state legislatures to give content to those evolving views, while dismissing or minimizing the relevance of views expressed through other state actors who\u2014pursuant to state constitutional or statutory law\u2014also express state policy on questions of punishment.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote] And the cases about state structure that this Article identifies reach broader still, to areas ranging from sovereign immunity, to constitutional amendments, to how the Court decides who speaks for the state on the shadow docket.\r\n\r\nThese cases do not merely nod to state structure on the way to reaching (or, in some cases, not reaching) questions of substantive constitutional law.
