				<p>Among the most powerful barriers to relief under § 1983 is <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services</em>—the Supreme Court decision recognizing that municipalities can be liable for constitutional violations by their officers but setting an exceedingly high standard for such claims. This Essay suggests a litigation strategy that sidesteps several challenges posed by <em>Monell</em>: Plaintiffs should pursue <em>Monell</em> claims based on police departments’ disregard of lawsuits brought against them and their officers.</p>
<p>Every circuit recognizes a police department’s failure to investigate citizen complaints as a basis for municipal liability. Although lawsuits—like citizen complaints—allege officer wrongdoing, many departments do not investigate their allegations. If failing to investigate citizen complaints is a sufficient basis for <em>Monell</em> liability, failing to investigate lawsuit allegations should be as well.</p>
<p>Police departments’ disregard of information unearthed during litigation should also be a basis for municipal liability. If internal affairs investigators fail to interview witnesses or gather relevant information, the municipality can be held liable under <em>Monell</em>. Litigation files contain depositions and evidence about officers’ conduct that departments routinely ignore. If failing to interview witnesses or consider relevant information during internal affairs investigations is a sufficient basis for <em>Monell</em> liability, disregarding litigation information that would fill gaps in internal affairs investigations should be as well.</p>
<p>In the short term, pursuing <em>Monell</em> claims based on departments’ inattention to lawsuits should make it easier to plead and prove municipal liability. Longer term, effectively requiring police officials to take account of litigation information may improve police departments’ internal investigations and supervision of their officers.</p>

		By “§ 1983 litigation,” this Essay refers to lawsuits filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against government officers and local governments. For a discussion of the passage of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 during the Reconstruction following the Civil War, the development of § 1983 doctrine in recent decades, and the many challenges associated with bringing such claims today, see Joanna Schwartz, Shielded: How the Police Became Untouchable, at xvii–xx, 3–7, 10–16 (2023) [hereinafter Schwartz, Shielded].	</span>

 This Essay proposes a novel legal theory—requiring only a modest extension of existing law—that will make it easier to prove municipal liability claims in the short term and may also encourage more profound and long-lasting improvements to the ways gov­ernment agencies investigate and supervise their officers.</p>

<p class="Document">In <i>Monell v. Department of Social Services</i>,<i> </i>the Supreme Court first rec­ognized that local governments can be sued for constitutional violations by their employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Although private businesses can be held vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of their employees, the Supreme Court held in <i>Monell </i>that local governments are only liable for their officers’ constitutional violations if municipal policies or customs caused those violations to occur.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Indeed, it is significantly more difficult to plead and prove a <i>Monell </i>claim than it is to overcome the qualified immunity defense.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Doing so would be consistent with common understandings of the intent of those who drafted § 1983, would greatly simplify the litigation of § 1983 claims, and would improve our system of constitutional remediation in multiple ways.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Replacing <i>Monell </i>with vicarious liability for local governments may also be among the most politically palatable possible reforms; since 2020, Republican sena­tors opposed to ending qualified immunity have periodically offered imposing vicarious liability for municipalities as a counterproposal.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Yet replacing <i>Monell </i>with vicarious liability has still proven a steep hill to climb: Only one state has enacted legislation along these lines, and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has indicated recent interest in revisiting <i>Monell</i>.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p class="Document">This Essay offers an alternative path around the barriers of <i>Monell</i> that does not require convincing courts or legislatures to change the law: Plaintiffs should pursue <i>Monell</i> claims based on local governments’ disre­gard of allegations and information in lawsuits brought against them and their employees.

 If police departments were effectively forced by the threat of <i>Monell </i>liability to investigate lawsuit allegations and review information unearthed during litigation, those litigation materials could fill gaps in police departments’ current practices without renegotiating union agreements or somehow forcing internal affairs investigators to do a better job.</p>

It is certainly possible that, in response to the threat of municipal liability for ignoring litigation information, police departments will institute bare-bones policies to investigate lawsuit allegations and review lawsuit data, which courts will use to conclude that departments are satisfying their obligations under <i>Monell</i>, and little will change. Departments will still fail to carefully supervise their officers, and municipal liability will remain exceedingly difficult to prove.

 If police departments are effectively required to take account of the robust information about officers’ alleged misconduct that is generated during litigation, plaintiffs and their attorneys will have added incentive to unearth evidence of misconduct and put it into the record. That information could either lead departments to better investigate, discipline, and supervise their officers (achieving an intended deterrent effect of municipal liability claims) or could convince courts that departments are deliberately indifferent when they fail to take more decisive action (securing municipal liability for plaintiffs). If plaintiffs and their attorneys capitalize on police departments’ newfound attention to lawsuits, they can use those suits to notify police officials of misconduct and failures in supervision that they cannot afford to ignore.</p>

<p class="Document">The remainder of this Essay proceeds as follows. Part I describes the <i>Monell </i>doctrine, the many challenges of pleading and proof it poses, and the impact of those challenges on the system of civil rights remediation. Then, Part II proposes a novel <i>Monell</i> theory based on departments’ inattention to information in lawsuits brought against them and their officers. It describes evidence that police departments disregard litigation information; sets out two different <i>Monell </i>claims that could be alleged; addresses counterarguments municipalities might raise in response; and offers an example of how litigation of these claims might play out. Part III explores the possible impact of these novel claims on plaintiffs’ ability to establish municipal liability and on departments’ supervision and investigation of their officers.</p>

For a discussion of the passage of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 during the Reconstruction following the Civil War, the development of \u00a7\u00a01983 doctrine in recent decades, and the many challenges associated with bringing such claims today, see Joanna Schwartz, Shielded: How the Police Became Untouchable, at xvii\u2013xx, 3\u20137, 10\u201316 (2023) [hereinafter Schwartz, Shielded].[\/footnote] This Essay proposes a novel legal theory\u2014requiring only a modest extension of existing law\u2014that will make it easier to prove municipal liability claims in the short term and may also encourage more profound and long-lasting improvements to the ways gov\u00adernment agencies investigate and supervise their officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Monell v. Department of Social Services<\/i>,<i> <\/i>the Supreme Court first rec\u00adognized that local governments can be sued for constitutional violations by their employees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.[footnote]See 436 U.S. 658, 663 (1978).[\/footnote] Although private businesses can be held vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of their employees, the Supreme Court held in <i>Monell <\/i>that local governments are only liable for their officers\u2019 constitutional violations if municipal policies or customs caused those violations to occur.[footnote]See id. at 691\u201395.[\/footnote] The evidence necessary to meet the requirements imposed by <i>Monell <\/i>and its progeny has proven extremely challenging to find.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] Indeed, it is significantly more difficult to plead and prove a <i>Monell <\/i>claim than it is to overcome the qualified immunity defense.[footnote]See Joanna C. Schwartz, Municipal Immunity, 109 Va. L. Rev. 1181, 1200\u201313 (2023) [hereinafter Schwartz, Municipal Immunity] (examining almost 1,200 police misconduct lawsuits filed in five federal districts and finding that local governments challenged municipal liability claims more often than individual defendants raised qualified immunity and that courts dismissed <i>Monell<\/i> claims more often than they granted officers qualified immunity); see also infra notes 42\u201349 and accompanying text (detailing these findings).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Many have called on courts and legislators to replace <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability for local governments.[footnote]See infra note 110 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Doing so would be consistent with common understandings of the intent of those who drafted \u00a7\u00a01983, would greatly simplify the litigation of \u00a7\u00a01983 claims, and would improve our system of constitutional remediation in multiple ways.[footnote]See infra notes 99\u2013109 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Replacing <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability for local governments may also be among the most politically palatable possible reforms; since 2020, Republican sena\u00adtors opposed to ending qualified immunity have periodically offered imposing vicarious liability for municipalities as a counterproposal.[footnote]See infra note 111 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Yet replacing <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability has still proven a steep hill to climb: Only one state has enacted legislation along these lines, and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has indicated recent interest in revisiting <i>Monell<\/i>.[footnote]See infra note 112 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">This Essay offers an alternative path around the barriers of <i>Monell<\/i> that does not require convincing courts or legislatures to change the law: Plaintiffs should pursue <i>Monell<\/i> claims based on local governments\u2019 disre\u00adgard of allegations and information in lawsuits brought against them and their employees. This Essay develops this theory in the context of suits alleging law enforcement misconduct, because I have studied police departments\u2019 inattention to lawsuits brought against them,[footnote]See infra notes 12, 15; see also infra section II.A.[\/footnote] but this the\u00adory could support <i>Monell <\/i>claims challenging the conduct of other types of government agencies as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Police departments are unquestionably obligated to investigate citizen complaints alleging officer misconduct; every circuit has recognized that the failure to do so can be the basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability.[footnote]See infra note 147 (describing these cases).[\/footnote]Lawsuits, like citi\u00adzen complaints, allege officer wrongdoing; as police auditors have com\u00admented, a lawsuit is, in essence, a \u201ccivilian complaint plus a demand for money.\u201d[footnote]See Joanna C.

Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t).[\/footnote] Studies have found that many allegations made in lawsuits are not asserted in citizen complaints or otherwise brought to police depart\u00adments\u2019 attention.[footnote]See infra note 122 and accompanying text (describing these studies).[\/footnote] And even when they are, experts have found that lawsuit complaints\u2014when drafted by lawyers\u2014are often clearer and more comprehensive than complaints called into police departments or filled in on complaint forms.[footnote]See infra note 123 and accompanying text (describing these studies).[\/footnote] Yet many police departments do not investigate alle\u00adgations in lawsuits brought against them and their officers as they would allegations in citizen complaints.[footnote]See Joanna C.

Part III explores the possible impact of these novel claims on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to establish municipal liability and on departments\u2019 supervision and investigation of their officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

For a discussion of the passage of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 during the Reconstruction following the Civil War, the development of \u00a7\u00a01983 doctrine in recent decades, and the many challenges associated with bringing such claims today, see Joanna Schwartz, Shielded: How the Police Became Untouchable, at xvii\u2013xx, 3\u20137, 10\u201316 (2023) [hereinafter Schwartz, Shielded].[\/footnote] This Essay proposes a novel legal theory\u2014requiring only a modest extension of existing law\u2014that will make it easier to prove municipal liability claims in the short term and may also encourage more profound and long-lasting improvements to the ways gov\u00adernment agencies investigate and supervise their officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">In <i>Monell v. Department of Social Services<\/i>,<i> <\/i>the Supreme Court first rec\u00adognized that local governments can be sued for constitutional violations by their employees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.[footnote]See 436 U.S. 658, 663 (1978).[\/footnote] Although private businesses can be held vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of their employees, the Supreme Court held in <i>Monell <\/i>that local governments are only liable for their officers\u2019 constitutional violations if municipal policies or customs caused those violations to occur.[footnote]See id. at 691\u201395.[\/footnote] The evidence necessary to meet the requirements imposed by <i>Monell <\/i>and its progeny has proven extremely challenging to find.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] Indeed, it is significantly more difficult to plead and prove a <i>Monell <\/i>claim than it is to overcome the qualified immunity defense.[footnote]See Joanna C. Schwartz, Municipal Immunity, 109 Va. L. Rev. 1181, 1200\u201313 (2023) [hereinafter Schwartz, Municipal Immunity] (examining almost 1,200 police misconduct lawsuits filed in five federal districts and finding that local governments challenged municipal liability claims more often than individual defendants raised qualified immunity and that courts dismissed <i>Monell<\/i> claims more often than they granted officers qualified immunity); see also infra notes 42\u201349 and accompanying text (detailing these findings).[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Many have called on courts and legislators to replace <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability for local governments.[footnote]See infra note 110 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Doing so would be consistent with common understandings of the intent of those who drafted \u00a7\u00a01983, would greatly simplify the litigation of \u00a7\u00a01983 claims, and would improve our system of constitutional remediation in multiple ways.[footnote]See infra notes 99\u2013109 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Replacing <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability for local governments may also be among the most politically palatable possible reforms; since 2020, Republican sena\u00adtors opposed to ending qualified immunity have periodically offered imposing vicarious liability for municipalities as a counterproposal.[footnote]See infra note 111 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Yet replacing <i>Monell <\/i>with vicarious liability has still proven a steep hill to climb: Only one state has enacted legislation along these lines, and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has indicated recent interest in revisiting <i>Monell<\/i>.[footnote]See infra note 112 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">This Essay offers an alternative path around the barriers of <i>Monell<\/i> that does not require convincing courts or legislatures to change the law: Plaintiffs should pursue <i>Monell<\/i> claims based on local governments\u2019 disre\u00adgard of allegations and information in lawsuits brought against them and their employees. This Essay develops this theory in the context of suits alleging law enforcement misconduct, because I have studied police departments\u2019 inattention to lawsuits brought against them,[footnote]See infra notes 12, 15; see also infra section II.A.[\/footnote] but this the\u00adory could support <i>Monell <\/i>claims challenging the conduct of other types of government agencies as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Police departments are unquestionably obligated to investigate citizen complaints alleging officer misconduct; every circuit has recognized that the failure to do so can be the basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability.[footnote]See infra note 147 (describing these cases).[\/footnote]Lawsuits, like citi\u00adzen complaints, allege officer wrongdoing; as police auditors have com\u00admented, a lawsuit is, in essence, a \u201ccivilian complaint plus a demand for money.\u201d[footnote]See Joanna C. Schwartz, What Police Learn From Lawsuits, 33 Cardozo L. Rev. 841, 856 &amp; n.88 (2012) [hereinafter Schwartz, What Police Learn] (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Michael Gennaco, Chief Att\u2019y, Off. of Indep. Rev., L.A. Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t).[\/footnote] Studies have found that many allegations made in lawsuits are not asserted in citizen complaints or otherwise brought to police depart\u00adments\u2019 attention.[footnote]See infra note 122 and accompanying text (describing these studies).[\/footnote] And even when they are, experts have found that lawsuit complaints\u2014when drafted by lawyers\u2014are often clearer and more comprehensive than complaints called into police departments or filled in on complaint forms.[footnote]See infra note 123 and accompanying text (describing these studies).[\/footnote] Yet many police departments do not investigate alle\u00adgations in lawsuits brought against them and their officers as they would allegations in citizen complaints.[footnote]See Joanna C. Schwartz, Myths and Mechanics of Deterrence: The Role of Lawsuits in Law Enforcement Decisionmaking, 57 UCLA L. Rev. 1023, 1058\u201359 (2010) [hereinafter Schwartz, Myths and Mechanics] (describing available evidence suggesting many departments do not investigate allegations made in lawsuits); see also infra section II.A.[\/footnote] If failing to investigate citizen com\u00adplaints is sufficient basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability, failing to investigate allegations in lawsuits should be as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Police departments\u2019 disregard of information unearthed during liti\u00adgation should be an additional basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability. Litigation files are chock-full of deposition testimony, audio and\/or video recordings, and other evidence about officers\u2019 conduct.[footnote]See infra notes 120\u2013121 and accompanying text (describing the evidence generated in litigation).[\/footnote] Those who have compared liti\u00adgation files with internal affairs investigations files of the same allegations have found the litigation files to be far more complete.[footnote]See infra note 124 and accompanying text (describing experts\u2019 perspectives about the differences between internal investigations files and litigation files).[\/footnote] Yet many police departments do not review information from lawsuits either as part of their internal affairs investigations of officers\u2019 conduct or to inform supervision and training decisions.[footnote]See Schwartz, Myths and Mechanics, supra note 15, at 1058\u201359 (describing evidence of police departments\u2019 disregard of information generated during litigation); see also infra section II.A.[\/footnote] Courts have ruled that perfunctory internal affairs investigations\u2014in which investigators fail to interview available wit\u00adnesses or take account of available information\u2014can be a basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability.[footnote]See infra notes 176\u2013179 (describing these cases).[\/footnote] If a department systematically ignores litigation information that would fill gaps in their internal affairs investigations, that failure should be a basis for <i>Monell <\/i>liability as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These novel claims would not overcome every barrier currently posed by <i>Monell<\/i>.[footnote]For further discussion of these limitations, see infra notes 270\u2013275 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] They could not be employed to address all types of government wrongdoing, do not ease all challenges of <i>Monell <\/i>litigation, and would not prove successful in places without lawyers willing or able to bring civil rights suits. But, in jurisdictions that do not investigate lawsuit allegations or review information revealed during litigation, these claims may be easier to plead and prove than other types of<i> Monell <\/i>claims and so could meaningfully expand the scope of municipal liability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These claims have an added benefit: If successful, they could prompt improvements to the way police departments investigate and supervise their officers. For decades, investigations of police departments\u2019 internal affairs processes have revealed the same shortcomings: People are discouraged from filing citizen complaints; the complaints that are filed are inadequately investigated, if they are investigated at all; discipline is rarely imposed; and those rare disciplinary decisions are often overturned in arbitration or on appeal.[footnote]See infra notes 277\u2013284 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] If police departments were effectively forced by the threat of <i>Monell <\/i>liability to investigate lawsuit allegations and review information unearthed during litigation, those litigation materials could fill gaps in police departments\u2019 current practices without renegotiating union agreements or somehow forcing internal affairs investigators to do a better job.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Profound improvement is by no means guaranteed. It is certainly possible that, in response to the threat of municipal liability for ignoring litigation information, police departments will institute bare-bones policies to investigate lawsuit allegations and review lawsuit data, which courts will use to conclude that departments are satisfying their obligations under <i>Monell<\/i>, and little will change. Departments will still fail to carefully supervise their officers, and municipal liability will remain exceedingly difficult to prove. Given courts\u2019 tendencies to dismiss <i>Monell<\/i> claims and police departments\u2019 tendencies to ignore lawsuits brought against them, there are good reasons to adopt this pessimistic view.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">This Essay nevertheless finds cause for cautious optimism\u2014both regarding the viability of these claims and their potential impact on police department practices\u2014in the newfound role litigation information would play in the investigation and supervision of police. Plaintiffs and their attorneys have strong motivations to uncover evidence of misconduct and have powerful discovery tools at their disposal.[footnote]See infra notes 285\u2013287 and accompanying text (describing how litigation information can fill gaps in internal affairs investigation processes).[\/footnote] If police departments are effectively required to take account of the robust information about officers\u2019 alleged misconduct that is generated during litigation, plaintiffs and their attorneys will have added incentive to unearth evidence of misconduct and put it into the record. That information could either lead departments to better investigate, discipline, and supervise their officers (achieving an intended deterrent effect of municipal liability claims) or could convince courts that departments are deliberately indifferent when they fail to take more decisive action (securing municipal liability for plaintiffs). If plaintiffs and their attorneys capitalize on police departments\u2019 newfound attention to lawsuits, they can use those suits to notify police officials of misconduct and failures in supervision that they cannot afford to ignore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The remainder of this Essay proceeds as follows. Part I describes the <i>Monell <\/i>doctrine, the many challenges of pleading and proof it poses, and the impact of those challenges on the system of civil rights remediation. Then, Part II proposes a novel <i>Monell<\/i> theory based on departments\u2019 inattention to information in lawsuits brought against them and their officers. It describes evidence that police departments disregard litigation information; sets out two different <i>Monell <\/i>claims that could be alleged; addresses counterarguments municipalities might raise in response; and offers an example of how litigation of these claims might play out. Part III explores the possible impact of these novel claims on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to establish municipal liability and on departments\u2019 supervision and investigation of their officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

But, in jurisdictions that do not investigate lawsuit allegations or review information revealed during litigation, these claims may be easier to plead and prove than other types of<i> Monell <\/i>claims and so could meaningfully expand the scope of municipal liability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">These claims have an added benefit: If successful, they could prompt improvements to the way police departments investigate and supervise their officers. For decades, investigations of police departments\u2019 internal affairs processes have revealed the same shortcomings: People are discouraged from filing citizen complaints; the complaints that are filed are inadequately investigated, if they are investigated at all; discipline is rarely imposed; and those rare disciplinary decisions are often overturned in arbitration or on appeal.[footnote]See infra notes 277\u2013284 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] If police departments were effectively forced by the threat of <i>Monell <\/i>liability to investigate lawsuit allegations and review information unearthed during litigation, those litigation materials could fill gaps in police departments\u2019 current practices without renegotiating union agreements or somehow forcing internal affairs investigators to do a better job.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">Profound improvement is by no means guaranteed. It is certainly possible that, in response to the threat of municipal liability for ignoring litigation information, police departments will institute bare-bones policies to investigate lawsuit allegations and review lawsuit data, which courts will use to conclude that departments are satisfying their obligations under <i>Monell<\/i>, and little will change. Departments will still fail to carefully supervise their officers, and municipal liability will remain exceedingly difficult to prove. Given courts\u2019 tendencies to dismiss <i>Monell<\/i> claims and police departments\u2019 tendencies to ignore lawsuits brought against them, there are good reasons to adopt this pessimistic view.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">This Essay nevertheless finds cause for cautious optimism\u2014both regarding the viability of these claims and their potential impact on police department practices\u2014in the newfound role litigation information would play in the investigation and supervision of police. Plaintiffs and their attorneys have strong motivations to uncover evidence of misconduct and have powerful discovery tools at their disposal.[footnote]See infra notes 285\u2013287 and accompanying text (describing how litigation information can fill gaps in internal affairs investigation processes).[\/footnote] If police departments are effectively required to take account of the robust information about officers\u2019 alleged misconduct that is generated during litigation, plaintiffs and their attorneys will have added incentive to unearth evidence of misconduct and put it into the record. That information could either lead departments to better investigate, discipline, and supervise their officers (achieving an intended deterrent effect of municipal liability claims) or could convince courts that departments are deliberately indifferent when they fail to take more decisive action (securing municipal liability for plaintiffs). If plaintiffs and their attorneys capitalize on police departments\u2019 newfound attention to lawsuits, they can use those suits to notify police officials of misconduct and failures in supervision that they cannot afford to ignore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"Document\">The remainder of this Essay proceeds as follows. Part I describes the <i>Monell <\/i>doctrine, the many challenges of pleading and proof it poses, and the impact of those challenges on the system of civil rights remediation. Then, Part II proposes a novel <i>Monell<\/i> theory based on departments\u2019 inattention to information in lawsuits brought against them and their officers. It describes evidence that police departments disregard litigation information; sets out two different <i>Monell <\/i>claims that could be alleged; addresses counterarguments municipalities might raise in response; and offers an example of how litigation of these claims might play out. Part III explores the possible impact of these novel claims on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to establish municipal liability and on departments\u2019 supervision and investigation of their officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>",
