				<p>The newest federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA), reflects a recent turn toward basing social policy on research evidence. Proponents suggest that evidence-based policymaking in education and other social policy areas can help cut through ideological debate and provide meaningful limits on the choices made by the federal executive branch, states, and localities. This Essay argues that such hopes for evidence-based policymaking are overambitious. It first analyzes the evidence provisions in ESSA and demonstrates how little they constrain policy choices. It then assesses the limits of the research base in education, showing how little agreement there is on major research findings, how difficult it is to conduct this kind of research in the first place, and how challenging it is to implement the findings that exist. The Essay concludes by arguing that a major challenge for evidence-based policymaking is the deep divide among citizens and policymakers about the underlying purpose of education and other social policies in the first instance; many important policy debates are about values and cannot be resolved by appealing to research at all. This critique of evidence-based policymaking does not suggest that research is unimportant or that facts are only in the eye of the beholder but rather that claims for what evidence-based policymaking can accomplish in education and other social policy areas should be treated skeptically.</p>

				<p>* Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center. Thanks to the <em>Columbia Law Review</em> editors for inviting me to participate in this Symposium honoring the legacy of Constance Baker Motley, and to the Symposium’s other contributors and attendees for en­riching conversations. Thanks also to Lily Faulhaber, Tom Glaisyer, Nora Gordon, Cara Jackson, Josef Konvitz, Chase Sackett, and Beryl Radin for constructive comments; to par­ticipants in the Reflections on Executive Power and Administrative Law Conference at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Law School for useful insight; and to Marietta Catsambas, Felycia Itza, and Claire Saba for helpful research assistance. This Essay is dedicated to the memory of my great-uncle Milton R. Konvitz, who was one of three lawyers working with Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund when Constance Baker Motley joined the LDF staff in 1945. See Constance Baker Motley, Equal Justice Under Law 59 (1998) (describing Konvitz’s role at LDF); see also David J. Danelski, Rights, Liberties, and Ideals: The Contributions of Milton R. Konvitz 15 (1983) (same). In 1964, Motley (then a state senator) and Konvitz (then on the faculty at Cornell) were joint winners of the NYU Wash­ington Square College Alumni Association’s achievement award for their respective work in the civil rights movement. See College and School News, 71 Crisis 340, 344 (1964). It is a privilege for me to pay tribute to them both at the same time in this Symposium Essay.</p>

<p>As the rest of this Essay argues, however, one would be wrong to pre­dict that ESSA’s evidence requirements will impose any meaningful con­straints on the federal executive, states, or school districts. It is also not likely that these requirements will themselves result in significant im­provements to education in America or resolve raging debates about the best way to engage in school reform.</p>
<p>Why not? First, as Part I illustrates, although ESSA’s references to evi­dence-based decisionmaking are numerous, its actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking are anything but stringent.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>Moreover, as Part II lays out, requirements to identify “what works” overestimate the current knowledge base and potential for future research, and they underestimate the challenges of implementation in the messy, human endeavor of teaching and learning that goes on every day in thousands of jurisdictions all over America. While the analysis in this Part focuses on education research, the critiques apply more broadly to social science research in general.</p>
<p>Finally, as Part III explains, the elusive search for “what works” can obscure critical and often contested values-based decisions about what we should be trying to do in the first place and about necessary tradeoffs along the way. This Part, too, focuses on education policy, but the argument extends broadly to other kinds of social policy.</p>
<p>This Essay should not be read as a critique of the evidence require­ments in ESSA but rather as a caution against the fetishization of evi­dence in social science policymaking more generally. Too often, policy­makers envision what evaluation scholars call an “instrumental role” for evidence, in which research will provide an uncontested answer to a clear policy problem.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Too often, then, decision­makers on the ground end up using evidence in what evaluation scholars call a “symbolic” way, “creat[ing] legitimacy for solutions that are already favored or even enacted,” thereby largely undermining the point of requiring evidence-based decisions in the first place.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 In the words of Carol Weiss, a pioneer­ing scholar in the evaluation of social policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social research can be “used” in reconceptualizing the charac­ter of policy issues or even redefining the policy agenda. Thus, social research may sensitize decisionmakers to new issues and turn what were nonproblems into policy problems . . . . In turn, it may convert existing social problems into nonproblems . . . . It may drastically revise the way that a society thinks about issues . . . , the facets of an issue that are viewed as susceptible to alteration, and the alternative measures that it considers.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 In this way, it is an important part of policy analysis. But it should be viewed as only one component of the democratic deliberation and political con­testation in which education, like other social policies, is rooted.</p>
<p>The focus on evidence-based policymaking in education has some valuable aspects, then, but it should not be seen as a panacea or as a neutral, technocratic solution. Evidence alone is insufficient to resolve complex social problems with contested underlying values and goals, and we ought not expect that it will.</p>

<h3>A. ESSA’s Instructions for the Use of Evidence</h3>

 However, the actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking under ESSA are few. As this section ex­plains, the references to evidence are (1) not directed at the federal gov­ernment; (2) include only limited requirements for states, school dis­tricts, and schools; (3) provide a generous definition of what counts as “evidence”; and (4) are in most cases merely suggestions.</p>
<p>1.<em> Not Directed at the Federal Government.</em> — It is important first to distinguish among the entities that might be subject to ESSA’s evidence instructions: the federal executive branch, state education author­ities, and local school districts and schools.</p>
<p>Unlike in many other regulatory programs, with broad delegations to federal agencies to regulate a policy area “in the public interest” or in a manner that is “fair and equitable,” congressional delegations to the Department of Education largely authorize the agency to award grants to states and districts under terms that are intricately detailed by statute.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 ESSA’s focus on evidence will therefore do little to constrain the Department of Education.</p>
<p>To be sure, plenty of other parts of ESSA limit what the Secretary of Education can do.

 As this subsection explains, ESSA’s only requirements for evidence ap­pear in Title I. ESSA contains other, smaller formula grants, as well as a wide variety of competitive grants, but as section I.A.4 explains below, the focus on evidence in these grants is permissive rather than mandatory.</p>
<p>The requirements for evidence-based practices appear in only two places in Title I: in the development of school districts’ plans to engage parents and families,<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>These provisions constitute the sum total of the evidence requirements in the Act. Note the limited categories of schools and stu­dents to which the more significant requirements—those for school im­provement plans—apply. The requirements apply only to decisions about how to respond to the persistently low performance of certain subsets of children and ex­tremely small percentages of schools. While this is an im­portant category of children and schools, these requirements are simply not going to significantly transform or constrain the education decisions of states, dis­tricts, and schools as a whole.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>3. <em>Generous Definitions of Evidence.</em> — To be sure, these requirements could, in principle, play a dramatic role for the neediest children and schools if the term “evidence-based” itself imposed meaningful constraints on decisionmaking.

<p>There is a fourth, less demanding tier of evidence.

<p>As Part II below will make clear, it is not difficult to find evidence to support a vast range of educational interventions under these definitions, even under the top three tiers that are applicable to school improvement plans. Tier three (“promising evidence”) and tier four (a “rationale” with a promise to assess it as implemented) are especially easy to meet. To be sure, the commitment that grantees make under tier four to engage in ongoing assessment of their activities could encourage them to make better decisions—but the reality is that only those grantees who already want to engage in the process of continuous improvement are likely to take this opportunity seriously.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 all of these references to evidence could be satisfied with not much more than an articulated ra­tionale based on some research found somewhere. These provisions may refer to evidence, then, but they are hardly constraining.</p>
<p>The same is true of references to evidence in ESSA’s competitive grants. While certain competitive grants encourage applicants to embed evidence-based activities in their programs, the encouragement is not particularly strenuous. For example, some grants provide “priority points” for applicants who can demonstrate that their proposed activities are sup­ported by evidence from the top three tiers, but they do not require ap­plicants to make such a demonstration.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 so the effect of these evidence requirements on the nation’s core educational institutions is further diluted. And, of course, the nature of competitive grants is that not every eligible entity will apply, and certainly not every entity that ap­plies will win one.</p>
<p>The permissive references to evidence throughout ESSA thus may do more to express a mood than to provide an actual set of transforma­tive constraints.</p>
<h3>B. Opportunities to Find, Promote, and Use Evidence as Desired—Or to Ignore It</h3>
<p>To illustrate the lack of constraints imposed by ESSA’s references to evidence, it is worth considering the ways in which the states and the fed­eral government can continue to push their own policy prefer­ences within the bounds of the law.</p>

<p>That some aspects of the Act call for evidence while others do not is notable. It might suggest that some aspects of education are too compli­cated to demand evidence for; that in some categories of action, federal­ism trumps evidence; or simply that political dealmaking reached the median voter here. Whatever the reason, it is clear that in vast swaths of their educational undertakings, states need not examine research but may simply make policy choices.</p>

<p>The absence of regulatory language on evidence offers another ave­nue to further an administration’s policy goals. For example, in 2016, the Obama accountability rules placed an additional limit on how to estab­lish that interventions in school improvement plans under ESSA would be evidence based: It would not be acceptable to pick an intervention that is justified only by a lower tier of evidence if an intervention justified by a higher tier of evidence would also be appropriate.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 Nothing in ESSA’s embrace of evidence would restrict the budget process from un­dercutting that embrace.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, then, ESSA’s focus on evidence, both on the face of the law and in its operation, does little to meaningfully limit the pol­icy options available to the Department of Education and the states.</p>
<h2>II. The Limits of the Research</h2>
<p>Even if ESSA’s language were tightened, however, challenges would remain, for no provision requiring evidence-based decisionmaking is likely to dramatically improve education in America. The hope that evidence will drive such a transformation stems from “assum[ptions] that evidence is clear, unambiguous, and available; that decision makers use evidence in an instrumental fashion, weighing the merits of alternate courses of action and choosing the solutions that best fit the problem; and there­fore that evidence leads directly to decisions.”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<h3>A. The Small and Contested Research Base</h3>
<p>As two leading education funders and former federal officials wrote almost a decade into the No Child Left Behind era, “[G]iven the amount of paper and breath expended on the various pedagogical ‘wars,’ one might think that by now there would be more definitive knowledge and agree­ment on what to do.”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>That having been said, there is no doubt that the quality and quan­tity of research in education have exploded over the course of the last two decades. In large part, this development was prompted by incentives in federal law. Reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Edu­cation Act (ESEA) of 1965 and additional stand-alone legislation dating back to 1988 started to encourage a focus on finding and implementing effective programs.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 This focus reached a high point in 2002, when Congress reauthorized the ESEA as NCLB, which required numerous in­terventions relying on “scientifically based research,”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

		The term “scientifically based research” appeared 111 times in NCLB. See Kamina Aliya Pinder, Using Federal Law to Prescribe Pedagogy: Lessons Learned from the Scien­tifically-Based Research Requirements of No Child Left Behind, 6 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 47, 59 (2008). NCLB’s definition of “scientific research” was controversial, as it seemed to limit acceptable forms of research to randomized control trials. See, e.g., David C. Berliner, Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 18, 18 (critiquing NCLB’s definition). ESSA’s expansion of the phrase “evidence-based” to in­clude four tiers of research instead of just the top tier is in part a response to these cri­tiques. See West, supra note 31 (explaining the difference between ESSA’s evidence re­quirements and NCLB’s “scientifically based research”).	</span>

<p>In a twist on the familiar contrast between the hard sciences (“[p]hys­ics, chemistry, geology, and so on”) and the soft sciences (“the social sciences in general and education in particular”), one education scholar instead contrasts the “[h]ard-to-do science[s]” (like social science in gen­eral and education in particular) and the “[e]asy-to-do science[s]” (like physics, chemistry, and the rest).<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>Another challenge in education research is that teaching involves multiple sets of interactions moving back and forth in multiple ways over multiple time periods. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any teaching behavior interacts with a number of student char­acteristics, including IQ, socioeconomic status, motivation to learn, and a host of other factors. Simultaneously, student be­havior is interacting with teacher characteristics, such as the teacher’s training in the subject taught, conceptions of learning, beliefs about assessment, and even the teacher’s personal happi­ness with life. But it doesn’t end there because other variables interact with those just mentioned—the curriculum materials, the socioeconomic status of the community, peer effects in the school, youth employment in the area, and so forth. Moreover, we are not even sure in which directions the influences work, and many surely are reciprocal.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 The bottom line, though, is that the voli­tion of teachers is an important part of why implementing evidence-based policies in schools is not as easy as just a direction from the top.</p>
<p>The research-to-practice problem thus joins the research-difficulty prob­lem and the state-of-knowledge problem in underscoring the improb­ability that calls to rely on evidence will cure what ails education in America.</p>
<h2>III. The Limits of Technocracy</h2>
<p>A final reason why the calls for evidence-based decisionmaking in ESSA are not going to transform education in America is that citizens are deeply divided about the underlying purpose of education (just as the country is divided about so many other social policies). As one set of scholars has written, “It is noteworthy that there is clarity about what de­fines a successful airplane but a lack of consensus on what defines a suc­cessful school and how we measure successes.”<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<blockquote><p>What if policy elites incorrectly concluded that Catholic schools are superior to public ones, and did something about this in the policies they created? What if they erroneously concluded that vouchers stimulate academic achievement, and did something about this in terms of funding priorities? What if they falsely concluded that school desegregation does not affect minority achievement when it does, and acted accordingly?

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>ESSA’s calls for evidence-based policymaking have an intuitive appeal. Of course we should spend our limited public dollars on what works, and we should not spend our limited public dollars on what does not. The complexities outlined above do not indicate that we should disregard evidence or give up in despair on the research endeavor, believing that data exist only in the eye of the beholder or that we are each entitled to our own facts.<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

<p>We should, however, be more realistic about our expectations for evidence-based policymaking in education and other social policies. We must understand that the answer to the question of “what works” will al­ways be more complicated than a sound bite; research brooks no easy an­swers, and implementation is messy. We must also understand that asking “what works” is itself a value-laden question. What works for what? For whom? To what end?<button class="footnote-count footnote-inline-show">

 This is true. But the compelling culture of democratic accountability also demands vigorous debate about the underlying goals to which public monies are put. We ought to high­light this debate whenever calls for evidence-based policymaking imply that technocratic, value-free solutions are only a research study away.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the invocations of evidence in ESSA. It is good to encourage decisionmakers to canvas their needs and examine what research might help them meet those needs. But evidence require­ments do not provide a meaningful way to constrain decisionmaking in education, nor are they likely to provide the answers that will fix the sys­tem once and for all. We should not let a focus on evidence distract us from the democratic debate at the core of education. In conversations about the right path forward for education policy—and other policies that form the fabric of our democracy—we ignore discussions of values at our peril.</p>

It is also not likely that these requirements will themselves result in significant im\u00adprovements to education in America or resolve raging debates about the best way to engage in school reform.\r\n\r\nWhy not? First, as Part I illustrates, although ESSA\u2019s references to evi\u00addence-based decisionmaking are numerous, its actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking are anything but stringent.[footnote]See infra section I.A. [\/footnote] The Depart\u00adment of Education, states, and school districts retain many opportunities to push their preferred policy choices.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Part II lays out, requirements to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d overestimate the current knowledge base and potential for future research, and they underestimate the challenges of implementation in the messy, human endeavor of teaching and learning that goes on every day in thousands of jurisdictions all over America. While the analysis in this Part focuses on education research, the critiques apply more broadly to social science research in general.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Part III explains, the elusive search for \u201cwhat works\u201d can obscure critical and often contested values-based decisions about what we should be trying to do in the first place and about necessary tradeoffs along the way. This Part, too, focuses on education policy, but the argument extends broadly to other kinds of social policy.\r\n\r\nThis Essay should not be read as a critique of the evidence require\u00adments in ESSA but rather as a caution against the fetishization of evi\u00addence in social science policymaking more generally. Too often, policy\u00admakers envision what evaluation scholars call an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d for evidence, in which research will provide an uncontested answer to a clear policy problem.[footnote]Cynthia E. Coburn, Meredith I. Honig &amp; Mary Kay Stein, What\u2019s the Evidence on Districts\u2019 Use of Evidence?, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement 67, 75 (John D.

For example, the Secretary may not reject a state\u2019s funding application for any substantive reason; the Secretary is limited to asking for compliance with the technical requirements laid out by stat\u00adute.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07871(c) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] The Secretary may not require states or school districts seeking a waiver under any part of the Act to commit to taking any particular steps in order to receive the waiver.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07861(b)(4), (d)(3).[\/footnote] And the Secretary is prevented from prom\u00adulgating expansive rules or issuing detailed nonregulatory guidance on particular components of state compliance with the Act.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06311(e), 7915.[\/footnote] This aspect of ESSA grows out of congressional charges, especially from Republicans, that President Obama\u2019s Department of Education aggrandized both the federal role in general and the executive branch\u2019s authority in particular.[footnote]See, e.g., Patrick McGuinn, From No Child Left Behind to the Every Student Suc\u00adceeds Act: Federalism and the Education Legacy of the Obama Administration, 46 Publius: J.

Title I contains the key provisions on standards, testing, and accountability with which states, districts, and schools must comply,[footnote]See, e.g., Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 114\u201326) (describing how ESSA\u2019s regime for standards, testing, and accountability in Title I ap\u00adplies to states, districts, and schools and is the central part of the Act); Lorraine M.

ESSA contains other, smaller formula grants, as well as a wide variety of competitive grants, but as section I.A.4 explains below, the focus on evidence in these grants is permissive rather than mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for evidence-based practices appear in only two places in Title I: in the development of school districts\u2019 plans to engage parents and families,[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(b)(7), 6318(a)(2)(E) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] and in the development of school \u201csupport and improvement plan[s]\u201d for a small group of schools that are not adequately meeting the state\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] Neither of these require\u00adments is broadly systemic.\r\n\r\nThe first of these activities\u2014designing parent engagement plans\u2014is not a central part of the Act; it is merely one of twenty-odd things a local school district must include in its application to receive a subgrant under ESSA from the state.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a), (b)(7).[\/footnote] There is no real consequence for failure to do any of the things the school districts say they will do in asking for their sub\u00adgrant.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(a)(5), 6318(h) (providing for local review but not state conse\u00adquences); see also Pasachoff, Agency Enforcement, supra note 37, at 284 (describing infre\u00adquency of funding cut-offs for a grantee\u2019s noncompliance with terms of a grant).[\/footnote] The requirement for the parent engagement plan to explain how the school district will conduct a needs assessment and then use the findings \u201cto design evidence-based strategies for more effective parental involve\u00adment\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(D)\u2013(E).[\/footnote] thus cannot be seen as transformative or constraining in any way.\r\n\r\nThe second of these activities\u2014designing school improvement plans\u2014is a much bigger deal, as these plans are core to the accountability re\u00adgime that lies at the center of the Act.[footnote]See, e.g., Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 115\u201317, 124\u201326) (contrasting NCLB and ESSA accountability regimes as the central parts of each Act).[\/footnote] Here, too, however, the calls for evidence-based interventions are not that significant.\r\n\r\nThere are two situations in which school improvement plans are re\u00adquired. The first situation is narrower, based on low achievement of one or more \u201csubgroups\u201d in a school.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2).[\/footnote] \u201cSubgroup of students\u201d is a term of art in the statute, as it was in No Child Left Behind,[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) (2002).[\/footnote] meaning \u201ceconomi\u00adcally disadvantaged students,\u201d \u201cstudents from major racial and ethnic groups,\u201d \u201cchildren with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cEnglish learners.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(2) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] For all schools in which one or more of these subgroups \u201care consistently underper\u00adforming\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A)(ii).[\/footnote] under the state\u2019s accountability requirements\u2014test scores, graduation rates for high schools, progress in achieving English profi\u00adciency, and any \u201cother indicator of school quality or student success\u201d that the state wishes to adopt[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(B)\u2013(C).[\/footnote]\u2014the state educational agency must inform the local school district of these schools\u2019 existence and must ensure that the school district in turn notifies the schools.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A).[\/footnote] Each school must then work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a \u201ctargeted support and im\u00adprovement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to remedy the problem for the relevant subgroup(s).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(B).[\/footnote] This targeted plan must then be approved and subsequently monitored by the school district.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second situation that requires a school improvement plan is broader, based on the performance of the school as a whole.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1).[\/footnote] For at least those schools that perform the worst in the state on tests or on high school graduation rates, as well as for those schools in which a subgroup\u2019s performance on its own would rank at the bottom of the state\u2019s perform\u00adance requirements,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(D)(i).[\/footnote] the state educational agency must again identify these schools to their school district.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Now, instead of simply notifying the schools that they must implement an improvement plan, the school dis\u00adtrict itself has to work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a school-level \u201ccomprehensive support and improvement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to fix the school\u2019s achievement problems.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] This comprehensive plan must be approved not only by the individual school and school district but also by the state educational agency,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(v).[\/footnote] which must also then monitor its implementation.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(vi).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese provisions constitute the sum total of the evidence requirements in the Act. Note the limited categories of schools and stu\u00addents to which the more significant requirements\u2014those for school im\u00adprovement plans\u2014apply. The requirements apply only to decisions about how to respond to the persistently low performance of certain subsets of children and ex\u00adtremely small percentages of schools. While this is an im\u00adportant category of children and schools, these requirements are simply not going to significantly transform or constrain the education decisions of states, dis\u00adtricts, and schools as a whole.[footnote]Cf. Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 125\u201326) (criticizing ESSA\u2019s accountability regime for applying to \u201calmost no one,\u201d and describing requirements for evidence-based interventions as positive but nonetheless \u201crelatively mi\u00adnor\u201d in light of the vast flexibility otherwise granted to states).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Generous Definitions of Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 To be sure, these requirements could, in principle, play a dramatic role for the neediest children and schools if the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d itself imposed meaningful constraints on decisionmaking. That is, if \u201cevidence-based\u201d closed off a significant universe of options, then it could indeed be constraining. But it does not.\r\n\r\nThe statute devotes several paragraphs to a definition of the term \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)\u2013(B).[\/footnote] ESSA presents four possible ways, with different de\u00adgrees of strenuousness, by which an entity may show that \u201can activity, strategy, or intervention\u201d is \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe three most demanding ways require a grantee to \u201cdemonstrate[] a statistically significant effect on improving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes,\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i).[\/footnote] with different tiers of evidence required to make that showing: There must be either (1) \u201cstrong evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented experimental study\u201d; (2) \u201cmoderate evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented quasi-exper\u00adimental study\u201d; or (3) \u201cpromising evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III).[\/footnote] These are the tiers of evidence that must apply to the school improvement plans and related state activities for the lowest-achieving schools and student subgroups.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth, less demanding tier of evidence. To be evidence based under this tier, an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention\u201d need not be statistically significant, but must merely \u201cdemonstrate[] a rationale based on high-quality research findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(I).[\/footnote] Such an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention,\u201d if se\u00adlected by an educational authority, must also \u201cinclude[] ongoing efforts to examine the effects of such activity, strategy, or intervention.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(II).[\/footnote] This fourth tier is applicable to the requirement for evidence in developing parent and family engagement plans; such plans may be based on evi\u00addence in one of the top three tiers, but need not be, as long as they are based on evidence that would satisfy this fourth tier.[footnote]Compare id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B) (defining \u201cevidence-based\u201d activities as only those that satisfy one of the top three tiers of evidence), with id. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(E) (imposing no such limitation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs Part II below will make clear, it is not difficult to find evidence to support a vast range of educational interventions under these definitions, even under the top three tiers that are applicable to school improvement plans. Tier three (\u201cpromising evidence\u201d) and tier four (a \u201crationale\u201d with a promise to assess it as implemented) are especially easy to meet. To be sure, the commitment that grantees make under tier four to engage in ongoing assessment of their activities could encourage them to make better decisions\u2014but the reality is that only those grantees who already want to engage in the process of continuous improvement are likely to take this opportunity seriously.[footnote]See West, supra note 31 (noting \u201c[t]hose six words [\u201c\u2018ongoing efforts to examine the effects\u2019 of the activity on important student outcomes\u201d], if taken seriously and imple\u00admented with care, hold the potential to create and provide resources to sustain a new model for decision-making within state agencies and school districts,\u201d but \u201c[t]he oppor\u00adtunity to use federal funds for evaluation purposes will only make a difference if state offi\u00adcials choose to exploit it.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to the extent ESSA\u2019s evidence requirements include con\u00adstraints, the constraints are not on determining what state, district, and school educational goals should be, but only on how to achieve those goals. Because ESSA as a whole is shot through with providing substan\u00adtive discretion to states, districts, and schools,[footnote]Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 127\u201329).[\/footnote] the statute\u2019s evidence def\u00adinitions do little to limit policy choices.\r\n\r\n4. <em>Other, Broadly Permissive References to Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 Beyond the par\u00adent engagement plans and the school improvement plans in Title I, the other references to evidence in ESSA are all permissive rather than man\u00addatory.

These provisions may refer to evidence, then, but they are hardly constraining.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of references to evidence in ESSA\u2019s competitive grants. While certain competitive grants encourage applicants to embed evidence-based activities in their programs, the encouragement is not particularly strenuous. For example, some grants provide \u201cpriority points\u201d for applicants who can demonstrate that their proposed activities are sup\u00adported by evidence from the top three tiers, but they do not require ap\u00adplicants to make such a demonstration.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06642(e) (grants for \u201c[c]omprehensive literacy State development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06672(e) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(e) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07243(c) (grants for \u201cstate\u00adwide family engagement centers\u201d); id \u00a7\u00a07274(b) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(b) (grants for \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(f) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-ability learners and learning\u201d); see also id. \u00a7\u00a07231e(2)(A) (listing evi\u00addence-based projects as one of several ways applicants for grants to support magnet schools may establish priority).[\/footnote] Some further limit a portion (but not all) of any federal funds awarded to those activities that are gen\u00aderally \u201cevidence-based\u201d (including the bottom tier of evidence).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06672(a)(2), (5) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(a)(6) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07242,\u00a07243(b)(6)(G) (grants for \u201cstatewide family engagement centers\u201d).[\/footnote] Some also require ongoing evaluation of the extent to which the grant pro\u00adgrams are successful.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07274(h), (i) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(f), (g) (grants for \u201c[f]ull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(h) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-abil\u00adity learners and learning\u201d).[\/footnote] One is designed to encourage broad efforts to \u201ccreate, develop, implement, replicate, or take to scale entrepreneurial, evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement and attain\u00adment for high-need students.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07261(a)(1)(A) (grants for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo embed incentives for evidence across numerous multimillion dollar grants is not nothing.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06603(b) (authorizing close to $500 million each year for a variety of competitive grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07246 (authorizing $10 million each year for another competi\u00adtive grant); id. \u00a7\u00a07251(a) (authorizing between $200 and $221 million each year for an\u00adother set of competitive grants).[\/footnote] But nor is it everything. There remain many competitive grants in ESSA that do not require any particular evidence-based decisionmaking to support an application.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06662 (grants for \u201cPresidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07221b(g) (grants to support \u201chigh-quality charter schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07281 (grants for \u201c[n]ational activities for school safety\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07292 (grants for \u201cassistance for arts education\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07293 (grants for \u201c[r]eady to learn programming\u201d).[\/footnote] The eligible entities for some of the grants encouraging evidence-based thinking are not even state educational authorities, school districts, or schools,[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06672(f) (including institutions of higher education and nonprofits as eligible entities for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07261(b) (including nonprofits acting on their own as well as a governmental agency acting in partnership with a nonprofit, a business, \u201can educational service agency,\u201d or \u201can institu\u00adtion of higher education\u201d as eligible entities for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07272(1) (including institutions of higher education as well as nonprofits working in partnership with certain other entities as eligible entities for \u201c[p]romise neigh\u00adborhood[]\u201d grants, and including a consortium of community-based organizations or nonprofit organizations as eligible entities for \u201cfull-service community school[]\u201d grants).[\/footnote] so the effect of these evidence requirements on the nation\u2019s core educational institutions is further diluted. And, of course, the nature of competitive grants is that not every eligible entity will apply, and certainly not every entity that ap\u00adplies will win one.\r\n\r\nThe permissive references to evidence throughout ESSA thus may do more to express a mood than to provide an actual set of transforma\u00adtive constraints.\r\n<h3>B. Opportunities to Find, Promote, and Use Evidence as Desired\u2014Or to Ignore It<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the lack of constraints imposed by ESSA\u2019s references to evidence, it is worth considering the ways in which the states and the fed\u00aderal government can continue to push their own policy prefer\u00adences within the bounds of the law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>State Choices.<\/em> \u2014 Because states are the primary recipients of fund\u00ading under ESSA\u2014most local money is allocated through subgrants[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a)(1) (authorizing subgrants to local school districts).[\/footnote]\u2014state authority to steer school districts and schools toward state priorities for education is significant.\r\n\r\nAs should be clear from the discussion of ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions above, there are major parts of the Act that simply require no evidence whatsoever. States need not justify their standards with respect to any evi\u00addence of what works.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(A) (detailing requirements for \u201cchallenging\u201d standards without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] The same is true of their tests,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B) (detailing requirements for \u201chigh-quality\u201d assess\u00adments without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their teacher cer\u00adtification plans,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(2)(J) (detailing assurances a state must offer on teacher certifica\u00adtion without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their plans for teaching English learners[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(F), (b)(2)(G) (detailing requirements for standards and as\u00adsessments for English learners without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote]\u2014the list goes on.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311 (detailing requirements for state plans in general but including evi\u00addence requirements only at \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)\u2013(2)); see also supra notes 51\u201361 and accompa\u00adnying text (describing these evidence requirements).[\/footnote] States can simply make assertions in their applications for formula grants about how they plan to work on these issues without examining any research evidence first.[footnote]See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(1)\u2013(2) (detailing descriptions states must offer and assur\u00adances they must provide without requiring any consultation of evidence).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat some aspects of the Act call for evidence while others do not is notable. It might suggest that some aspects of education are too compli\u00adcated to demand evidence for; that in some categories of action, federal\u00adism trumps evidence; or simply that political dealmaking reached the median voter here. Whatever the reason, it is clear that in vast swaths of their educational undertakings, states need not examine research but may simply make policy choices.\r\n\r\nWhen states do have to use research evidence, ESSA also provides numerous opportunities for states to require districts and schools to adopt whatever evidence-based interventions the state prioritizes.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(3)(B)(ii).[\/footnote] This type of activity illustrates what evaluation scholars call a \u201csanctioning role\u201d for evidence, when state or federal agencies deem particular inter\u00adventions \u201c\u2018research-based\u2019 and thus approved for use with state or federal funds.\u201d[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 75, 78.[\/footnote] Here, too, then, states are empowered to select the evidence they find most persuasive to support the interventions they want to sup\u00adport anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother way states can specify the evidence-based interventions they prefer is designing criteria for ESSA\u2019s school improvement subgrants to local educational agencies.[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06303(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] Controlling the purse strings provides au\u00adthority to make policy choices without much constraint from the require\u00adment for evidence.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Federal Choices.<\/em> \u2014 There are numerous ways in which the Trump Administration can implement ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions while still push\u00ading its own agenda, whether through regulation, nonregulatory guid\u00adance, grant competitions, or the budget process.\r\n\r\nConsider first the role of regulation. Shortly before leaving office, the Obama Administration promulgated a final rule to implement the Act\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

Nothing would require states, districts, and schools to select these choices, but it is reasonable to imagine that at least some will find it easier to use what the Administration is promoting.[footnote]Others, of course, may prefer to avoid any strategy that the Trump Administra\u00adtion promotes (just as in the Obama era, the reverse may have been true for a differently aligned set of political actors), but at least some will just select from the offered list. See, e.g., Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 78 (describing a study in which several districts chose programs from a list without \u201cparticularly support[ing] [those programs] solely as a way to maintain their federal funding\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother way an administration can use the regulatory process to put its stamp on evidence is to clarify the definition of that term. For example, in 2013, as part of the Obama Administration\u2019s effort to pro\u00admote evidence-based policymaking more generally,[footnote]See supra note 6 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the Department of Education revised its General Administrative Regulations to include for the first time a detailed definition of evidence that it could use in the competitive grant application process.[footnote]Compare Direct Grant Programs and Definitions that Apply to Department Regu\u00adlations, 78 Fed.

For example, in 2016, the Obama accountability rules placed an additional limit on how to estab\u00adlish that interventions in school improvement plans under ESSA would be evidence based: It would not be acceptable to pick an intervention that is justified only by a lower tier of evidence if an intervention justified by a higher tier of evidence would also be appropriate.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

Each year, the President\u2019s budget will propose funding different programs and activities at different amounts, and different Pres\u00adidents prioritize different things.[footnote]See, e.g., Allen Schick, The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy, Process 101 (3d ed. 2007); Pasachoff, The President\u2019s Budget, supra note 29, at 2211\u201312.[\/footnote] Congress, too, can decide whether and to what extent to fund the President\u2019s priorities.[footnote]Schick, supra note 128, at 109.[\/footnote] A program that embeds evidence-based thinking may simply not be prioritized. At the same time, Congress can make clear, whether through formal appropria\u00adtions riders[footnote]Jason A. MacDonald, Limitation Riders and Congressional Influence over Bu\u00adreau\u00adcratic Policy Decisions, 104 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 766, 766--67 (2010) (describing limitation riders as \u201can effective tool for congressional influence over . . . bureaucratic policy making\u201d).[\/footnote] or informally in legislative history during the appropriations pro\u00adcess, how it wants the Department to allocate funds.[footnote]See, e.g., Schick, supra note 128,\u00a0 at 136 (discussing legislative history).[\/footnote] Nothing in ESSA\u2019s embrace of evidence would restrict the budget process from un\u00addercutting that embrace.\r\n\r\nFor all of these reasons, then, ESSA\u2019s focus on evidence, both on the face of the law and in its operation, does little to meaningfully limit the pol\u00adicy options available to the Department of Education and the states.\r\n<h2>II. The Limits of the Research<\/h2>\r\nEven if ESSA\u2019s language were tightened, however, challenges would remain, for no provision requiring evidence-based decisionmaking is likely to dramatically improve education in America. The hope that evidence will drive such a transformation stems from \u201cassum[ptions] that evidence is clear, unambiguous, and available; that decision makers use evidence in an instrumental fashion, weighing the merits of alternate courses of action and choosing the solutions that best fit the problem; and there\u00adfore that evidence leads directly to decisions.\u201d[footnote]Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 69.[\/footnote] As this Part demonstrates, however, these assumptions turn out to be wrong, in light of limits in the state of the research, difficulties in conducting this kind of social science research in the first place, and challenges in implementing what research findings exist.\r\n<h3>A. The Small and Contested Research Base<\/h3>\r\nAs two leading education funders and former federal officials wrote almost a decade into the No Child Left Behind era, \u201c[G]iven the amount of paper and breath expended on the various pedagogical \u2018wars,\u2019 one might think that by now there would be more definitive knowledge and agree\u00adment on what to do.\u201d[footnote]Frederic A. Mosher &amp; Marshall S. Smith<em>, <\/em>The Role of Research in Education Re\u00adform from the Perspective of Federal Policymakers and Foundation Grantmakers, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement, supra note 19, at 19, 32.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat having been said, there is no doubt that the quality and quan\u00adtity of research in education have exploded over the course of the last two decades. In large part, this development was prompted by incentives in federal law. Reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00adcation Act (ESEA) of 1965 and additional stand-alone legislation dating back to 1988 started to encourage a focus on finding and implementing effective programs.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin Michael Superfine, New Directions in School Funding and Governance: Moving from Politics to Evidence, 98 Ky. L.J. 653, 678\u201380 (2010) (describing this history); see also Michael J. Feuer, Lisa Towne &amp; Richard J. Shavelson, Scientific Culture and Educational Research, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 4, 4\u20136 (comparing this history to other fields).[\/footnote] This focus reached a high point in 2002, when Congress reauthorized the ESEA as NCLB, which required numerous in\u00adterventions relying on \u201cscientifically based research,\u201d[footnote]The term \u201cscientifically based research\u201d appeared 111 times in NCLB. See Kamina Aliya Pinder, Using Federal Law to Prescribe Pedagogy: Lessons Learned from the Scien\u00adtifically-Based Research Requirements of No Child Left Behind, 6 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 47, 59 (2008). NCLB\u2019s definition of \u201cscientific research\u201d was controversial, as it seemed to limit acceptable forms of research to randomized control trials. See, e.g., David C. Berliner, Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 18, 18 (critiquing NCLB\u2019s definition). ESSA\u2019s expansion of the phrase \u201cevidence-based\u201d to in\u00adclude four tiers of research instead of just the top tier is in part a response to these cri\u00adtiques. See West, supra note 31 (explaining the difference between ESSA\u2019s evidence re\u00adquirements and NCLB\u2019s \u201cscientifically based research\u201d).[\/footnote] and then subse\u00adquently passed the Education Sciences Reform Act, which expanded and institutionalized the federal infrastructure for funding and encouraging education research.[footnote]See Superfine, supra note 134, at 692 (calling the Education Sciences Reform Act \u201ca reasoned response to the inconsistent quality of educational research and the lack of a solid evidentiary base for making effective educational funding decisions,\u201d while also not\u00ading its \u201cfail[ure] to account for the complex and heavily contextualized nature of educa\u00adtion\u201d).

Despite critiques that NCLB\u2019s focus on experiments was too narrow a conception of what scientifically based research should be, see supra note 135, the 2002 laws led to an expansion in experiments in education.

Wong, Considering the Politics in the Research Policymaking Nexus, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 219, 235 (\u201cAs Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron points out, \u2018[P]eople wield their social science research studies like short swords and shields in the ideological wars.\u2019\u201d (quot\u00ading Andrew Rich, Think Tanks, Public Policy, and the Politics of Expertise 215 (2004))).[\/footnote] This state of play in the research limits the confi\u00addence that education decisionmakers can have that research findings represent a neutral determination of \u201cwhat works.\u201d\r\n\r\nCritiques on political grounds of the Institute for Education Sciences and its predecessor, the Office of Educational Research and Improve\u00adment, further complicate matters. Various charges over the decades have been that the federal research entity then in existence has \u201coverly politi\u00adcized\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. its reviews of programs,\u201d[footnote]Superfine, supra note 134, at 688; see also Maris A. Vinovskis, A History of Efforts to Improve the Quality of Federal Education Research: From Gardner\u2019s Task Force to the Institute of Education Sciences, <em>in<\/em> Education Research on Trial, supra note 2, at 51, 56, 59 [hereinafter Vinovskis, History of Efforts] (describing varying complaints during different eras from both sides of the aisle about the political slant of the agency\u2019s research staff).[\/footnote] too narrowly circumscribed the types of research it deems acceptable,[footnote]Pamela Barnhouse Walters, The Politics of Science: Battles for Scientific Author\u00adity in the Field of Education Research, <em>in<\/em> Education Research on Trial, supra note 2, at 17, 40 (discussing the American Educational Research Association\u2019s public statement \u201cexpress\u00ad[ing] dismay\u201d at the agency\u2019s limited view of appropriate scientific research in education); Wong, supra note 163, at 225 (\u201cPartisan shift tends to destabilize appropriations for re\u00adsearch because the policy priorities are likely to change.\u201d).[\/footnote] or even suppressed research findings for political reasons.[footnote]Kaestle, supra note 156, at 30.[\/footnote] The Department of Education office in charge of an NCLB-era evidence-based reading program faced similar allegations, culminating in a critical report by the Department\u2019s Inspec\u00adtor General Office.[footnote]Pinder, supra note 135, at 62, 75; see also Robert B. Schwartz &amp; Susan M. Kardos, Research-Based Evidence and State Policy, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Im\u00adprovement, supra note 19, at 47, 53 (\u201c[S]keptics [of evidence-based policymaking] view the movement, especially as it applies to the implementation of the federal government\u2019s reading policy, as one more example of ideology masquerading as science.\u201d).[\/footnote] Similar critiques exist of state-level government entities.[footnote]See, e.g., Fusarelli, supra note 14, at 183 (describing critiques of former Texas Commissioners of Education who owned companies promoting \u201c\u2018research-based\u2019 pro\u00adgrams\u201d that also appeared on an approved list to qualify for state funding).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDuring the era that No Child Left Behind and the Education Sci\u00adences Reform Act were being debated, the National Research Council published a major report on scientific research in education. After con\u00adsidering the appropriate extent of \u201c[p]olitical insulation\u201d of any federal educational research agency, the authors concluded that \u201c[i]t would be simply incompatible with the American tradition of democratic govern\u00adance to exclude political and social influences from decisions about re\u00adsearch priorities.\u201d[footnote]Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 10.[\/footnote] There is a real logic to this argument.[footnote]Cf. Pasachoff, The President\u2019s Budget, supra note 29, at 2269\u201370 (noting that funding decisions are \u201cvalue-laden decisions\u201d that have a proper place in government priority setting).[\/footnote] But it also comes with a cost. When the government promotes evidence-based deci\u00adsionmaking but does not seem neutral in so doing, it can be hard to see evidence itself as anything other than political.\r\n<h3>B. The Complexities of Education Research<\/h3>\r\nAnother set of issues further limits the likelihood that evidence-based policymaking will ultimately transform education in America: the com\u00adplexities inherent in conducting this kind of social science research.\r\n\r\nIn a twist on the familiar contrast between the hard sciences (\u201c[p]hys\u00adics, chemistry, geology, and so on\u201d) and the soft sciences (\u201cthe social sciences in general and education in particular\u201d), one education scholar instead contrasts the \u201c[h]ard-to-do science[s]\u201d (like social science in gen\u00aderal and education in particular) and the \u201c[e]asy-to-do science[s]\u201d (like physics, chemistry, and the rest).[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 18.[\/footnote] \u201cWe do our science under conditions that physical scientists find intolerable,\u201d wrote this education scholar, referring to messy, human, context-bound interactions.[footnote]Id.; see also Levin, supra note 140, at 4 (\u201c[K]nowledge about human behavior is in principle different from knowledge of the inanimate world\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Of course, even knowledge about the inanimate world has research challenges. See, e.g., Wendy E. Wagner, The Science Charade in Toxic Risk Regulation, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1613, 1619\u201322 (1995) (discussing \u201ctrans-science\u201d questions that can be hidden, intentionally or unintentionally, during the research process). These same challenges exist in education research. See, e.g., Simpson, supra note 158, at 463 (noting researchers\u2019 ability to \u201clegitimately directly ma\u00adnipulate effect size when they are looking to increase their chance of detecting a difference\u201d).[\/footnote] Or, as another tongue-in-cheek reflection on these challenges suggests, all social science knowledge can be generally summarized as follows: \u201c(1) Some do, some don\u2019t. (2) The differences aren\u2019t very great. (3) It\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d[footnote]Edward R. Tufte, Beautiful Evidence 138 (2006).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne challenge to education research is that it involves \u201ccomplex so\u00adcial systems such as classrooms and schools\u201d[footnote]Ginsburg &amp; Smith, supra note 140, at 6.[\/footnote] with \u201chumans\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. embed\u00added in complex and changing networks of social interaction.\u201d[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 7 (dis\u00adcussing features of education that complicate its study, including the volition and diversity of people and the variability of curriculum, instruction, and governance); Superfine, supra note 134, at 690\u201392 (discussing the \u201ccomplex and heavily contextualized nature of education\u201d).[\/footnote] Studies of interventions that seem to work in one con\u00adtext can be hard to repli\u00adcate in a wildly different context, given the number of often indetermin\u00adable and likely unmeasurable variables potentially at issue.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19 (describing \u201cthe ordinary events of life,\u201d from \u201ca sick child, a messy divorce, [or] a passionate love affair\u201d to \u201ca new principal, a new child in the classroom, [or] rain that keeps the children from a recess outside the school building,\u201d that \u201climit[] the generalizability of educational research findings\u201d); see also Ginsburg &amp; Smith, supra note 140, at 1 (noting that even randomized controlled trials with internal validity do not necessarily have external validity); Lawrence W. Sherman, Misleading Evi\u00addence and Evidence-Led Policy: Making Social Science More Experimental, Annals Am. Acad. Pol. &amp; Soc. Sci., Sept. 2003, at 6, 9 (explaining that \u201cthreats to <em>internal validity<\/em>\u201d con\u00adcern \u201cthe conclusions drawn within the sample,\u201d while threats to \u201c<em>external validity<\/em>\u201d concern \u201chow far the conclusions may be generalized to other populations\u201d).[\/footnote] It is also hard to make sure that the control group in an education exper\u00adiment does not, in fact, receive the experimental treatment, since mem\u00adbers across school communities often \u201chave social and professional rela\u00adtions\u201d that expose the control group to the experimental conditions.[footnote]Annette Lareau, Narrow Questions, Narrow Answers: The Limited Value of Ran\u00addomized Control Trials for Education Research, <em>in<\/em> Education Research on Trial, supra note 2, at 145, 152\u201353.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn part, the challenge relates to our highly decentralized educational system. Almost 14,000 school districts have different needs, populations, curricula, instructional practices, and governance structures.[footnote]Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Educ. Statistics, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Digest of Education Statistics: Table 214.10.

For example:\r\n<blockquote>Any teaching behavior interacts with a number of student char\u00adacteristics, including IQ, socioeconomic status, motivation to learn, and a host of other factors. Simultaneously, student be\u00adhavior is interacting with teacher characteristics, such as the teacher\u2019s training in the subject taught, conceptions of learning, beliefs about assessment, and even the teacher\u2019s personal happi\u00adness with life. But it doesn\u2019t end there because other variables interact with those just mentioned\u2014the curriculum materials, the socioeconomic status of the community, peer effects in the school, youth employment in the area, and so forth. Moreover, we are not even sure in which directions the influences work, and many surely are reciprocal.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Cohen et al., supra note 25, at 86\u201387 (dis\u00adcussing the difficulties of \u201cobservation and measurement of complex social and intellectu\u00adal processes\u201d involved in teaching).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIt is therefore difficult to isolate connections that might matter to a study\u2019s conclusions.\r\n\r\nA further challenge with conducting education research emerges from the difficulty of getting education decisionmakers to keep an intervention in place long enough to assess its value (even given the difficulties with assessment just discussed). Some interventions require long-term study,[footnote]See, e.g., Gueron, supra note 145, at 39 (\u201cThe life cycle of a major experiment or evaluation is often five or more years.\u201d); Vinovskis, History of Efforts, supra note 164, at 54 (describing an ideal \u201csystematic five-stage strategy for education research and develop\u00adment that would require 10\u201312 years to complete\u201d).[\/footnote] but decisionmakers often have short-term political needs that lead them to change a program before it has been fully implemented or assessed[footnote]See, e.g., Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201c[G]overnments have a propensity to change a program before outcomes have been assessed, so that any evaluation would thus be mea\u00adsuring moving targets with variable criteria of success.\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 152 (identifying \u201cprincipals\u2019 flagging interest in participating in a study\u201d as part of what brings \u201cdaunting, and arguably insurmountable, challenges\u201d to \u201crandomized controlled trials that focus on longitudinal change in schools\u201d).[\/footnote] or to \u201cinsist that measurable results be avail\u00adable in a short time-frame.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 84.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese challenges do not doom education (or broader social science) research, of course, but they do make it harder to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d in any straightforward sense.[footnote]For selected responses to this research challenge, see, e.g., Cook, supra note 152, at 131\u201332 (arguing that \u201cthe complexity and heterogeneity of schools leads to the need for larger school sample sizes and the need to anticipate and measure specific sources of varia\u00adtion to reduce their unwanted influence through statistical control\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 146 (arguing that a broader set of research methods than the randomized control trial\u2014\u201cqualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews\u201d\u2014is necessary in this context); Weiss, Politicization, supra note 161, at 62 (suggesting that in\u00adstead of \u201call-or-nothing, go\/no-go conclusions,\u201d researchers should attend to \u201cthe effec\u00adtiveness of variant conditions within programs\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and begin to explain which elements and sub-elements are associated with more or less success\u201d); Carol H. Weiss, What to Do Until the Random Assigner Comes, <em>in<\/em> Evidence Matters, supra note 25, at 198, 220\u201322 (dis\u00adcussing the value of \u201ctheory-based evaluation\u201d and \u201cruling out\u201d to evaluate \u201cthe sprawling changeable world of community programs\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRecent history also challenges the idea that educational research can, with enough dogged effort, identify solutions to social problems. In considering the utility of evidence-based policies in education and other social science fields, several scholars call for humility in the face of now-discredited but once widely held beliefs (about men and women, about race-based differences, about how children learn) that were based on research evidence.[footnote]See Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, An Elusive Science: The Troubling History of Ed\u00aducation Research 246 (2000) (\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, one can see the limitations of beliefs that once seemed indisputably true.\u201d); Berliner, supra note 135, at 20 (describing \u201cthe short half-life of [education research] findings\u201d in light of \u201cchanges in the social envi\u00adronment that invalidate the research or render it irrelevant\u201d); cf. Cecelia Klingele, The Promises and Perils of Evidence-Based Corrections, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 537, 575 (2016) (urging a similar humility in the context of correctional policy).[\/footnote] Recognizing that \u201c[r]esearch has been used to sup\u00adport positions that were later shown to be wrong or, even worse, are now considered morally repugnant, such as the supposed inferiority of some groups of people,\u201d suggests caution in assuming that the state of knowledge in the field provides scientifically valid answers simply because it is based on research evidence.[footnote]Levin, supra note 140, at 3.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nC. <em>The Research-to-Practice Dilemma<\/em>\r\n\r\nWhere high-quality, nonpartisan research findings exist, another challenge remains in translating these findings from research to prac\u00adtice.[footnote]See Lagemann, supra note 185, at 239\u201341 (explaining that the lack of a central\u00adized educational research community or organization has made it difficult to coordinate a research agenda that might aid policymakers).[\/footnote] Many implementation difficulties exist.[footnote]Cf.

But see Fusarelli, supra note 14, at 179 (\u201c[S]chool leaders are more likely to cite general research traditions or concepts such as brain research or emotional intelligence rather than specific studies.\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, \u201cconcerns remain about the capacities and dispositions of our govern\u00admental institutions to effectively interpret scientific evidence to the ex\u00adtent that it is present.\u201d[footnote]Superfine, supra note 134, at 692; see also Carrie L. Conaway, The Problem with Briefs, in Brief, 8 Educ. Fin. &amp; Pol\u2019y 287, 293 (2013) (suggesting that the most common complaint about academic writing is that it is difficult for non-academics to understand); Fusarelli, supra note 14, at 186 (discussing the difficulty of keeping up with huge quanti\u00adties of education research published each year even for \u201cfulltime education research\u00aders\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. let alone school leaders busy managing the increasingly complex daily operations of schools\u201d).[\/footnote] These concerns may exacerbate geographical disparities, as smaller, rural, or less wealthy districts and states may not have as much access to research findings as do larger urban or wealthier sub\u00adurban ones (let alone the ability to interpret them).[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 70 (discussing the wide variety in districts\u2019 ca\u00adpacity to access and consume research); Conaway, supra note 190, at 296 (noting that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of state education agencies do not have a research director); Sparks, Evi\u00addence-Based Fixes, supra note 143 (noting the importance of school context in education policy and asserting that ESSA\u2019s flexibility \u201cruns the risk of putting smaller or more rural districts at a disadvantage\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEntities like the research\u2013practice partnerships funded by the Insti\u00adtute for Education Sciences[footnote]See Neild, supra note 139 (describing recent growth in such partnerships); see also What Works Clearinghouse, Practice Guides, Inst. of Educ.

As cuts to univer\u00adsity funding have driven researchers to find other sources of research support, foundations and business philanthropy have stepped in; but such sponsorship again raises questions about the neutrality of the research, because these institutions are sometimes affiliated with clear advocacy positions.[footnote]Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 6, 11\u201312 (noting that when university re\u00adsearchers rely on sponsored funding, it calls into question whether their research is truly independent); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 248 (noting the financial and reputa\u00adtional incentives for researchers to \u201cdepict [their] work in ways that the [supporting] or\u00adganizations will find congenial and to remain quiescent if they stretch the findings or recommendations in the course of their efforts\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, when academics engage on their own with education decisionmakers in the hope of making their research rele\u00advant,[footnote]See, e.g., Conaway, supra note 190, at 290 (arguing for this kind of collabora\u00adtion); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252 (discussing the value of building relation\u00adships between education researchers and the subjects of their studies).[\/footnote] the potential emerges for policy \u201ccapture\u201d that negatively affects the \u201cscope of research projects.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 86 (discussing the danger of such \u201ccapture\u201d when re\u00adsearchers \u201cengage closely with policy bureaucrats\u201d); Henig, Evolving Relationship, supra note 155, at 62 (questioning \u201chow far down the path of relevance researchers can travel without something of value being put at stake\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252\u201353 (discussing the challenges within researcher\u2013practitioner relationships).[\/footnote] From another direction, academics unaffiliated with any institution other than their home institution have sometimes been accused of conducting ideologically driven research anyway.[footnote]See Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 7 (tracing the development of conserva\u00adtive think tanks to the claim that \u201cliberal academics had some direct and indirect influ\u00adence on social policy\u201d).[\/footnote] Academics have also found their work captured without their knowing assistance.[footnote]See, e.g., Ingersoll, supra note 145, at 128\u201329 (discussing this experience).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther potential mediating institutions fare no better in the quest for neutrality.

The Trump Administration is not going to be convinced to fund afterschool programs with a data dump of studies showing that the programs are successful. In\u00adstead, if the Administration changes its position on whether to fund a given program, it will be due to voters\u2019 moral outrage.[footnote]Cf.

Klingele, supra note 185, at 540\u201341 (\u201cAlthough most proponents of evidence-based correctional practices frame them as rehabilitative tools designed to reduce the use of incarceration and make correctional interventions more modest and humane, these tools are capable of doing the very opposite.\u201d).[\/footnote] Consider the rise of single-sex education over the last two decades. Early proponents included feminists who suggested that single-sex education could increase women\u2019s achievement.[footnote]See Rosemary Salomone, Rights and Wrongs in the Debate over Single-Sex Schooling, 93 B.U.

For example, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education<\/em>, the Supreme Court famously (and controversially) relied in part on a study showing that black children preferred pink dolls to brown dolls to justify its ruling that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]347 U.S. 483, 494 &amp; n.11 (1954) (citing social science research to justify the prop\u00adosition that segregation \u201cwith the sanction of law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has a tendency to [retard] the educa\u00adtional and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the ben\u00adefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).[\/footnote] Segre\u00adgationists later used that same study to argue in favor of segregation, since the study showed that black children in segregated schools actually \u201cex\u00adhibited less negative reactions to the brown doll and showed less desire to play with the pink doll.\u201d[footnote]Joshua Dunn &amp; Martin West, Calculated Justice: Education Research and the Courts, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 155, 162\u201363.[\/footnote] So did the evidence show that it was better to maintain segregated schools? When values are in play, neither side is likely to convince the other side with a neutral appeal to evidence.[footnote]See, e.g., Lindblom &amp; Cohen, supra note 24, at 52 (connecting the perceived \u201cau\u00adthoritativeness\u201d of social science research for its users with the extent to which the research \u201csquares with their ideology or conforms to their general world view or epistemological position\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a debate among education scholars and practi\u00adtioners about what school reform should properly focus on: fixing the system as it exists, or reimagining the system entirely.[footnote]See, e.g., David Tyack &amp; Larry Cuban, Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform 1 (1995) (describing the tension in Americans\u2019 attitude toward school reform as one between \u201cutopian thinking\u201d and \u201ctinkering,\u201d each with both positive and neg\u00adative connotations).[\/footnote] Evidence is more likely to play a helpful role in the former than the latter.[footnote]See Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201cEvidence-based arguments about \u2018fine-tuning\u2019, based on careful research about effectiveness, might be more likely to gain traction in those areas that are away from the political heat.\u201d).[\/footnote] And tinkering can be valuable.[footnote]See, e.g., Tyack &amp; Cuban, supra note 243, at 10 (discussing \u201ca positive kind of tinkering, adapting knowledgeably to local needs and circumstances, preserving what is valuable and correcting what is not\u201d); cf.

Of course we should spend our limited public dollars on what works, and we should not spend our limited public dollars on what does not. The complexities outlined above do not indicate that we should disregard evidence or give up in despair on the research endeavor, believing that data exist only in the eye of the beholder or that we are each entitled to our own facts.[footnote]Cf. Majone, supra note 227, at 10\u201311 (\u201cEvidence is not synonymous with data or information\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Facts can be evaluated in terms of more or less objective canons, but evidence must be evaluated in accordance with a number of factors peculiar to a given situation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWe should, however, be more realistic about our expectations for evidence-based policymaking in education and other social policies. We must understand that the answer to the question of \u201cwhat works\u201d will al\u00adways be more complicated than a sound bite; research brooks no easy an\u00adswers, and implementation is messy. We must also understand that asking \u201cwhat works\u201d is itself a value-laden question. What works for what? For whom? To what end?[footnote]See Greenhalgh &amp; Russell, supra note 222, at 315 (\u201c[R]esearch evidence can and should inform policy judgments\u2014but this evidence does not in and of itself provide the answer to the ethical question of \u2018what to do\u2019 (and in particular, \u2018how to allocate resources\u2019).\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 253\u201354 (\u201cResearch has a vital role to play in demo\u00adcratic policy debate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to dictate outcomes or to presume that public officials should be the handmaidens of researchers, but to ensure that public decisionmaking is informed by all the facts, insights, and analyses that the tools of science can provide.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe authors of the important 2002 National Research Council report on scientific research in education referenced above argued that the \u201ccompelling culture of democratic accountability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. demands evidence that public monies are wisely spent.\u201d[footnote]See Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 5; see also supra text accompanying note 169.[\/footnote] This is true. But the compelling culture of democratic accountability also demands vigorous debate about the underlying goals to which public monies are put. We ought to high\u00adlight this debate whenever calls for evidence-based policymaking imply that technocratic, value-free solutions are only a research study away.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the invocations of evidence in ESSA. It is good to encourage decisionmakers to canvas their needs and examine what research might help them meet those needs. But evidence require\u00adments do not provide a meaningful way to constrain decisionmaking in education, nor are they likely to provide the answers that will fix the sys\u00adtem once and for all. We should not let a focus on evidence distract us from the democratic debate at the core of education. In conversations about the right path forward for education policy\u2014and other policies that form the fabric of our democracy\u2014we ignore discussions of values at our peril.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It is also not likely that these requirements will themselves result in significant im\u00adprovements to education in America or resolve raging debates about the best way to engage in school reform.\r\n\r\nWhy not? First, as Part I illustrates, although ESSA\u2019s references to evi\u00addence-based decisionmaking are numerous, its actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking are anything but stringent.[footnote]See infra section I.A. [\/footnote] The Depart\u00adment of Education, states, and school districts retain many opportunities to push their preferred policy choices.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Part II lays out, requirements to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d overestimate the current knowledge base and potential for future research, and they underestimate the challenges of implementation in the messy, human endeavor of teaching and learning that goes on every day in thousands of jurisdictions all over America. While the analysis in this Part focuses on education research, the critiques apply more broadly to social science research in general.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Part III explains, the elusive search for \u201cwhat works\u201d can obscure critical and often contested values-based decisions about what we should be trying to do in the first place and about necessary tradeoffs along the way. This Part, too, focuses on education policy, but the argument extends broadly to other kinds of social policy.\r\n\r\nThis Essay should not be read as a critique of the evidence require\u00adments in ESSA but rather as a caution against the fetishization of evi\u00addence in social science policymaking more generally. Too often, policy\u00admakers envision what evaluation scholars call an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d for evidence, in which research will provide an uncontested answer to a clear policy problem.[footnote]Cynthia E. Coburn, Meredith I. Honig &amp; Mary Kay Stein, What\u2019s the Evidence on Districts\u2019 Use of Evidence?, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement 67, 75 (John D. Bransford, Deborah J. Stipek, Nancy J. Vye, Louis M. Gomez &amp; Diana Lam eds., 2009).[\/footnote] But research findings almost never provide a straight\u00adforward answer about what to do,[footnote]See infra notes 141\u2013186 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] and decisions about education and other social policies are enmeshed in a complex web of political realities, institutional capacities, and societal values.[footnote]See infra notes 222\u2013249 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Too often, then, decision\u00admakers on the ground end up using evidence in what evaluation scholars call a \u201csymbolic\u201d way, \u201ccreat[ing] legitimacy for solutions that are already favored or even enacted,\u201d thereby largely undermining the point of requiring evidence-based decisions in the first place.[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 77.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nInstead, evidence plays the most valuable role as what evaluation scholars call a \u201cconceptual\u201d tool.[footnote]See id. at 76\u201377.[\/footnote] In the words of Carol Weiss, a pioneer\u00ading scholar in the evaluation of social policy:\r\n<blockquote>Social research can be \u201cused\u201d in reconceptualizing the charac\u00adter of policy issues or even redefining the policy agenda.

But it should be viewed as only one component of the democratic deliberation and political con\u00adtestation in which education, like other social policies, is rooted.\r\n\r\nThe focus on evidence-based policymaking in education has some valuable aspects, then, but it should not be seen as a panacea or as a neutral, technocratic solution.

ESSA contains other, smaller formula grants, as well as a wide variety of competitive grants, but as section I.A.4 explains below, the focus on evidence in these grants is permissive rather than mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for evidence-based practices appear in only two places in Title I: in the development of school districts\u2019 plans to engage parents and families,[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(b)(7), 6318(a)(2)(E) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] and in the development of school \u201csupport and improvement plan[s]\u201d for a small group of schools that are not adequately meeting the state\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] Neither of these require\u00adments is broadly systemic.\r\n\r\nThe first of these activities\u2014designing parent engagement plans\u2014is not a central part of the Act; it is merely one of twenty-odd things a local school district must include in its application to receive a subgrant under ESSA from the state.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a), (b)(7).[\/footnote] There is no real consequence for failure to do any of the things the school districts say they will do in asking for their sub\u00adgrant.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(a)(5), 6318(h) (providing for local review but not state conse\u00adquences); see also Pasachoff, Agency Enforcement, supra note 37, at 284 (describing infre\u00adquency of funding cut-offs for a grantee\u2019s noncompliance with terms of a grant).[\/footnote] The requirement for the parent engagement plan to explain how the school district will conduct a needs assessment and then use the findings \u201cto design evidence-based strategies for more effective parental involve\u00adment\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(D)\u2013(E).[\/footnote] thus cannot be seen as transformative or constraining in any way.\r\n\r\nThe second of these activities\u2014designing school improvement plans\u2014is a much bigger deal, as these plans are core to the accountability re\u00adgime that lies at the center of the Act.[footnote]See, e.g., Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 115\u201317, 124\u201326) (contrasting NCLB and ESSA accountability regimes as the central parts of each Act).[\/footnote] Here, too, however, the calls for evidence-based interventions are not that significant.\r\n\r\nThere are two situations in which school improvement plans are re\u00adquired. The first situation is narrower, based on low achievement of one or more \u201csubgroups\u201d in a school.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2).[\/footnote] \u201cSubgroup of students\u201d is a term of art in the statute, as it was in No Child Left Behind,[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) (2002).[\/footnote] meaning \u201ceconomi\u00adcally disadvantaged students,\u201d \u201cstudents from major racial and ethnic groups,\u201d \u201cchildren with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cEnglish learners.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(2) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] For all schools in which one or more of these subgroups \u201care consistently underper\u00adforming\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A)(ii).[\/footnote] under the state\u2019s accountability requirements\u2014test scores, graduation rates for high schools, progress in achieving English profi\u00adciency, and any \u201cother indicator of school quality or student success\u201d that the state wishes to adopt[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(B)\u2013(C).[\/footnote]\u2014the state educational agency must inform the local school district of these schools\u2019 existence and must ensure that the school district in turn notifies the schools.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A).[\/footnote] Each school must then work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a \u201ctargeted support and im\u00adprovement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to remedy the problem for the relevant subgroup(s).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(B).[\/footnote] This targeted plan must then be approved and subsequently monitored by the school district.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second situation that requires a school improvement plan is broader, based on the performance of the school as a whole.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1).[\/footnote] For at least those schools that perform the worst in the state on tests or on high school graduation rates, as well as for those schools in which a subgroup\u2019s performance on its own would rank at the bottom of the state\u2019s perform\u00adance requirements,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(D)(i).[\/footnote] the state educational agency must again identify these schools to their school district.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Now, instead of simply notifying the schools that they must implement an improvement plan, the school dis\u00adtrict itself has to work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a school-level \u201ccomprehensive support and improvement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to fix the school\u2019s achievement problems.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] This comprehensive plan must be approved not only by the individual school and school district but also by the state educational agency,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(v).[\/footnote] which must also then monitor its implementation.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(vi).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese provisions constitute the sum total of the evidence requirements in the Act. Note the limited categories of schools and stu\u00addents to which the more significant requirements\u2014those for school im\u00adprovement plans\u2014apply. The requirements apply only to decisions about how to respond to the persistently low performance of certain subsets of children and ex\u00adtremely small percentages of schools. While this is an im\u00adportant category of children and schools, these requirements are simply not going to significantly transform or constrain the education decisions of states, dis\u00adtricts, and schools as a whole.[footnote]Cf. Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 125\u201326) (criticizing ESSA\u2019s accountability regime for applying to \u201calmost no one,\u201d and describing requirements for evidence-based interventions as positive but nonetheless \u201crelatively mi\u00adnor\u201d in light of the vast flexibility otherwise granted to states).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Generous Definitions of Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 To be sure, these requirements could, in principle, play a dramatic role for the neediest children and schools if the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d itself imposed meaningful constraints on decisionmaking. That is, if \u201cevidence-based\u201d closed off a significant universe of options, then it could indeed be constraining. But it does not.\r\n\r\nThe statute devotes several paragraphs to a definition of the term \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)\u2013(B).[\/footnote] ESSA presents four possible ways, with different de\u00adgrees of strenuousness, by which an entity may show that \u201can activity, strategy, or intervention\u201d is \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe three most demanding ways require a grantee to \u201cdemonstrate[] a statistically significant effect on improving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes,\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i).[\/footnote] with different tiers of evidence required to make that showing: There must be either (1) \u201cstrong evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented experimental study\u201d; (2) \u201cmoderate evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented quasi-exper\u00adimental study\u201d; or (3) \u201cpromising evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III).[\/footnote] These are the tiers of evidence that must apply to the school improvement plans and related state activities for the lowest-achieving schools and student subgroups.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth, less demanding tier of evidence. To be evidence based under this tier, an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention\u201d need not be statistically significant, but must merely \u201cdemonstrate[] a rationale based on high-quality research findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(I).[\/footnote] Such an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention,\u201d if se\u00adlected by an educational authority, must also \u201cinclude[] ongoing efforts to examine the effects of such activity, strategy, or intervention.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(II).[\/footnote] This fourth tier is applicable to the requirement for evidence in developing parent and family engagement plans; such plans may be based on evi\u00addence in one of the top three tiers, but need not be, as long as they are based on evidence that would satisfy this fourth tier.[footnote]Compare id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B) (defining \u201cevidence-based\u201d activities as only those that satisfy one of the top three tiers of evidence), with id. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(E) (imposing no such limitation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs Part II below will make clear, it is not difficult to find evidence to support a vast range of educational interventions under these definitions, even under the top three tiers that are applicable to school improvement plans. Tier three (\u201cpromising evidence\u201d) and tier four (a \u201crationale\u201d with a promise to assess it as implemented) are especially easy to meet. To be sure, the commitment that grantees make under tier four to engage in ongoing assessment of their activities could encourage them to make better decisions\u2014but the reality is that only those grantees who already want to engage in the process of continuous improvement are likely to take this opportunity seriously.[footnote]See West, supra note 31 (noting \u201c[t]hose six words [\u201c\u2018ongoing efforts to examine the effects\u2019 of the activity on important student outcomes\u201d], if taken seriously and imple\u00admented with care, hold the potential to create and provide resources to sustain a new model for decision-making within state agencies and school districts,\u201d but \u201c[t]he oppor\u00adtunity to use federal funds for evaluation purposes will only make a difference if state offi\u00adcials choose to exploit it.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to the extent ESSA\u2019s evidence requirements include con\u00adstraints, the constraints are not on determining what state, district, and school educational goals should be, but only on how to achieve those goals. Because ESSA as a whole is shot through with providing substan\u00adtive discretion to states, districts, and schools,[footnote]Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 127\u201329).[\/footnote] the statute\u2019s evidence def\u00adinitions do little to limit policy choices.\r\n\r\n4. <em>Other, Broadly Permissive References to Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 Beyond the par\u00adent engagement plans and the school improvement plans in Title I, the other references to evidence in ESSA are all permissive rather than man\u00addatory.

These provisions may refer to evidence, then, but they are hardly constraining.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of references to evidence in ESSA\u2019s competitive grants. While certain competitive grants encourage applicants to embed evidence-based activities in their programs, the encouragement is not particularly strenuous. For example, some grants provide \u201cpriority points\u201d for applicants who can demonstrate that their proposed activities are sup\u00adported by evidence from the top three tiers, but they do not require ap\u00adplicants to make such a demonstration.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06642(e) (grants for \u201c[c]omprehensive literacy State development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06672(e) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(e) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07243(c) (grants for \u201cstate\u00adwide family engagement centers\u201d); id \u00a7\u00a07274(b) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(b) (grants for \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(f) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-ability learners and learning\u201d); see also id. \u00a7\u00a07231e(2)(A) (listing evi\u00addence-based projects as one of several ways applicants for grants to support magnet schools may establish priority).[\/footnote] Some further limit a portion (but not all) of any federal funds awarded to those activities that are gen\u00aderally \u201cevidence-based\u201d (including the bottom tier of evidence).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06672(a)(2), (5) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(a)(6) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07242,\u00a07243(b)(6)(G) (grants for \u201cstatewide family engagement centers\u201d).[\/footnote] Some also require ongoing evaluation of the extent to which the grant pro\u00adgrams are successful.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07274(h), (i) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(f), (g) (grants for \u201c[f]ull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(h) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-abil\u00adity learners and learning\u201d).[\/footnote] One is designed to encourage broad efforts to \u201ccreate, develop, implement, replicate, or take to scale entrepreneurial, evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement and attain\u00adment for high-need students.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07261(a)(1)(A) (grants for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo embed incentives for evidence across numerous multimillion dollar grants is not nothing.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06603(b) (authorizing close to $500 million each year for a variety of competitive grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07246 (authorizing $10 million each year for another competi\u00adtive grant); id. \u00a7\u00a07251(a) (authorizing between $200 and $221 million each year for an\u00adother set of competitive grants).[\/footnote] But nor is it everything. There remain many competitive grants in ESSA that do not require any particular evidence-based decisionmaking to support an application.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06662 (grants for \u201cPresidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07221b(g) (grants to support \u201chigh-quality charter schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07281 (grants for \u201c[n]ational activities for school safety\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07292 (grants for \u201cassistance for arts education\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07293 (grants for \u201c[r]eady to learn programming\u201d).[\/footnote] The eligible entities for some of the grants encouraging evidence-based thinking are not even state educational authorities, school districts, or schools,[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06672(f) (including institutions of higher education and nonprofits as eligible entities for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07261(b) (including nonprofits acting on their own as well as a governmental agency acting in partnership with a nonprofit, a business, \u201can educational service agency,\u201d or \u201can institu\u00adtion of higher education\u201d as eligible entities for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07272(1) (including institutions of higher education as well as nonprofits working in partnership with certain other entities as eligible entities for \u201c[p]romise neigh\u00adborhood[]\u201d grants, and including a consortium of community-based organizations or nonprofit organizations as eligible entities for \u201cfull-service community school[]\u201d grants).[\/footnote] so the effect of these evidence requirements on the nation\u2019s core educational institutions is further diluted. And, of course, the nature of competitive grants is that not every eligible entity will apply, and certainly not every entity that ap\u00adplies will win one.\r\n\r\nThe permissive references to evidence throughout ESSA thus may do more to express a mood than to provide an actual set of transforma\u00adtive constraints.\r\n<h3>B. Opportunities to Find, Promote, and Use Evidence as Desired\u2014Or to Ignore It<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the lack of constraints imposed by ESSA\u2019s references to evidence, it is worth considering the ways in which the states and the fed\u00aderal government can continue to push their own policy prefer\u00adences within the bounds of the law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>State Choices.<\/em> \u2014 Because states are the primary recipients of fund\u00ading under ESSA\u2014most local money is allocated through subgrants[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a)(1) (authorizing subgrants to local school districts).[\/footnote]\u2014state authority to steer school districts and schools toward state priorities for education is significant.\r\n\r\nAs should be clear from the discussion of ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions above, there are major parts of the Act that simply require no evidence whatsoever. States need not justify their standards with respect to any evi\u00addence of what works.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(A) (detailing requirements for \u201cchallenging\u201d standards without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] The same is true of their tests,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B) (detailing requirements for \u201chigh-quality\u201d assess\u00adments without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their teacher cer\u00adtification plans,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(2)(J) (detailing assurances a state must offer on teacher certifica\u00adtion without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their plans for teaching English learners[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(F), (b)(2)(G) (detailing requirements for standards and as\u00adsessments for English learners without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote]\u2014the list goes on.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311 (detailing requirements for state plans in general but including evi\u00addence requirements only at \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)\u2013(2)); see also supra notes 51\u201361 and accompa\u00adnying text (describing these evidence requirements).[\/footnote] States can simply make assertions in their applications for formula grants about how they plan to work on these issues without examining any research evidence first.[footnote]See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(1)\u2013(2) (detailing descriptions states must offer and assur\u00adances they must provide without requiring any consultation of evidence).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat some aspects of the Act call for evidence while others do not is notable. It might suggest that some aspects of education are too compli\u00adcated to demand evidence for; that in some categories of action, federal\u00adism trumps evidence; or simply that political dealmaking reached the median voter here. Whatever the reason, it is clear that in vast swaths of their educational undertakings, states need not examine research but may simply make policy choices.\r\n\r\nWhen states do have to use research evidence, ESSA also provides numerous opportunities for states to require districts and schools to adopt whatever evidence-based interventions the state prioritizes.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(3)(B)(ii).[\/footnote] This type of activity illustrates what evaluation scholars call a \u201csanctioning role\u201d for evidence, when state or federal agencies deem particular inter\u00adventions \u201c\u2018research-based\u2019 and thus approved for use with state or federal funds.\u201d[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 75, 78.[\/footnote] Here, too, then, states are empowered to select the evidence they find most persuasive to support the interventions they want to sup\u00adport anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother way states can specify the evidence-based interventions they prefer is designing criteria for ESSA\u2019s school improvement subgrants to local educational agencies.[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06303(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] Controlling the purse strings provides au\u00adthority to make policy choices without much constraint from the require\u00adment for evidence.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Federal Choices.<\/em> \u2014 There are numerous ways in which the Trump Administration can implement ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions while still push\u00ading its own agenda, whether through regulation, nonregulatory guid\u00adance, grant competitions, or the budget process.\r\n\r\nConsider first the role of regulation. Shortly before leaving office, the Obama Administration promulgated a final rule to implement the Act\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86,076 (Nov. 29, 2016) (disapproved by Act of Mar. 27, 2017, Pub. L.

Nothing would require states, districts, and schools to select these choices, but it is reasonable to imagine that at least some will find it easier to use what the Administration is promoting.[footnote]Others, of course, may prefer to avoid any strategy that the Trump Administra\u00adtion promotes (just as in the Obama era, the reverse may have been true for a differently aligned set of political actors), but at least some will just select from the offered list. See, e.g., Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 78 (describing a study in which several districts chose programs from a list without \u201cparticularly support[ing] [those programs] solely as a way to maintain their federal funding\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother way an administration can use the regulatory process to put its stamp on evidence is to clarify the definition of that term. For example, in 2013, as part of the Obama Administration\u2019s effort to pro\u00admote evidence-based policymaking more generally,[footnote]See supra note 6 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the Department of Education revised its General Administrative Regulations to include for the first time a detailed definition of evidence that it could use in the competitive grant application process.[footnote]Compare Direct Grant Programs and Definitions that Apply to Department Regu\u00adlations, 78 Fed. Reg. 49,338, 49,355\u201356 (Aug. 13, 2013) (revising, inter alia, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a077.1, the section on definitions, and including definitions of terms relevant to evidence), with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a077.1 (2012) (including no definitions of terms relevant to evidence).[\/footnote] The Trump Administration re\u00adcently issued a final rule making technical changes to these definitions to conform to the language in ESSA,[footnote]See Definitions and Selection Criteria that Apply to Direct Grant Programs, 82 Fed.

See Exec. Order No. 13,777, 82 Fed.

For example, in 2016, the Obama accountability rules placed an additional limit on how to estab\u00adlish that interventions in school improvement plans under ESSA would be evidence based: It would not be acceptable to pick an intervention that is justified only by a lower tier of evidence if an intervention justified by a higher tier of evidence would also be appropriate.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86,076, 86,231 (Nov. 29, 2016) (disapproved by Act of Mar. 27, 2017, Pub. L.

This ab\u00adsence further opens the door for the Trump Administration to push its own policy choices more generally, even if supported by weaker evidence.\r\n\r\nNonregulatory guidance provides one opportunity to do so. Several months before the Obama Administration issued the accountability regu\u00adlations in November 2016, it issued nonregulatory guidance on using evi\u00addence.[footnote]U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Educa\u00adtion Investments (2016) [hereinafter U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Using Evidence], http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/\r\npolicy\/elsec\/leg\/essa\/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/A2T5-8GL5].[\/footnote] That guidance contained detailed recommendations for how states, districts, and schools should identify evidence at each of ESSA\u2019s four tiers.[footnote]Id. at 8\u20139.[\/footnote] Most importantly, the guidance explains that, while the stat\u00adutory definition of evidence-based requires only \u201cat least one study,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted) (paraphrasing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2015)).[\/footnote] stakeholders in fact \u201cshould consider the entire body of relevant evi\u00addence\u201d and should not choose interventions that only one study supports if there are other equally strong studies that reach the opposite conclusion about the intervention.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs of October 2017, that guidance document is still on the Trump Department of Education\u2019s website,[footnote]See U.S. Dep\u2019t Educ., Using Evidence, supra note 113 (providing a permalink that captured the document as of October 20, 2017).[\/footnote] but rescinding that guidance docu\u00adment would be one way for the Trump Administration to put its mark on the interventions it wants states, districts, and schools to select.

Rev. 766, 766--67 (2010) (describing limitation riders as \u201can effective tool for congressional influence over . . . bureaucratic policy making\u201d).[\/footnote] or informally in legislative history during the appropriations pro\u00adcess, how it wants the Department to allocate funds.[footnote]See, e.g., Schick, supra note 128,\u00a0 at 136 (discussing legislative history).[\/footnote] Nothing in ESSA\u2019s embrace of evidence would restrict the budget process from un\u00addercutting that embrace.\r\n\r\nFor all of these reasons, then, ESSA\u2019s focus on evidence, both on the face of the law and in its operation, does little to meaningfully limit the pol\u00adicy options available to the Department of Education and the states.\r\n<h2>II. The Limits of the Research<\/h2>\r\nEven if ESSA\u2019s language were tightened, however, challenges would remain, for no provision requiring evidence-based decisionmaking is likely to dramatically improve education in America. The hope that evidence will drive such a transformation stems from \u201cassum[ptions] that evidence is clear, unambiguous, and available; that decision makers use evidence in an instrumental fashion, weighing the merits of alternate courses of action and choosing the solutions that best fit the problem; and there\u00adfore that evidence leads directly to decisions.\u201d[footnote]Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 69.[\/footnote] As this Part demonstrates, however, these assumptions turn out to be wrong, in light of limits in the state of the research, difficulties in conducting this kind of social science research in the first place, and challenges in implementing what research findings exist.\r\n<h3>A. The Small and Contested Research Base<\/h3>\r\nAs two leading education funders and former federal officials wrote almost a decade into the No Child Left Behind era, \u201c[G]iven the amount of paper and breath expended on the various pedagogical \u2018wars,\u2019 one might think that by now there would be more definitive knowledge and agree\u00adment on what to do.\u201d[footnote]Frederic A. Mosher &amp; Marshall S. Smith<em>, <\/em>The Role of Research in Education Re\u00adform from the Perspective of Federal Policymakers and Foundation Grantmakers, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement, supra note 19, at 19, 32.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat having been said, there is no doubt that the quality and quan\u00adtity of research in education have exploded over the course of the last two decades. In large part, this development was prompted by incentives in federal law. Reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00adcation Act (ESEA) of 1965 and additional stand-alone legislation dating back to 1988 started to encourage a focus on finding and implementing effective programs.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin Michael Superfine, New Directions in School Funding and Governance: Moving from Politics to Evidence, 98 Ky. L.J. 653, 678\u201380 (2010) (describing this history); see also Michael J. Feuer, Lisa Towne &amp; Richard J. Shavelson, Scientific Culture and Educational Research, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 4, 4\u20136 (comparing this history to other fields).[\/footnote] This focus reached a high point in 2002, when Congress reauthorized the ESEA as NCLB, which required numerous in\u00adterventions relying on \u201cscientifically based research,\u201d[footnote]The term \u201cscientifically based research\u201d appeared 111 times in NCLB. See Kamina Aliya Pinder, Using Federal Law to Prescribe Pedagogy: Lessons Learned from the Scien\u00adtifically-Based Research Requirements of No Child Left Behind, 6 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 47, 59 (2008). NCLB\u2019s definition of \u201cscientific research\u201d was controversial, as it seemed to limit acceptable forms of research to randomized control trials. See, e.g., David C. Berliner, Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 18, 18 (critiquing NCLB\u2019s definition). ESSA\u2019s expansion of the phrase \u201cevidence-based\u201d to in\u00adclude four tiers of research instead of just the top tier is in part a response to these cri\u00adtiques. See West, supra note 31 (explaining the difference between ESSA\u2019s evidence re\u00adquirements and NCLB\u2019s \u201cscientifically based research\u201d).[\/footnote] and then subse\u00adquently passed the Education Sciences Reform Act, which expanded and institutionalized the federal infrastructure for funding and encouraging education research.[footnote]See Superfine, supra note 134, at 692 (calling the Education Sciences Reform Act \u201ca reasoned response to the inconsistent quality of educational research and the lack of a solid evidentiary base for making effective educational funding decisions,\u201d while also not\u00ading its \u201cfail[ure] to account for the complex and heavily contextualized nature of educa\u00adtion\u201d).

Despite critiques that NCLB\u2019s focus on experiments was too narrow a conception of what scientifically based research should be, see supra note 135, the 2002 laws led to an expansion in experiments in education.

Many researchers do not view this fact with des\u00adpair but rather see it as an expected part of conducting high-quality research. See, e.g., Judith M.

When the government promotes evidence-based deci\u00adsionmaking but does not seem neutral in so doing, it can be hard to see evidence itself as anything other than political.\r\n<h3>B. The Complexities of Education Research<\/h3>\r\nAnother set of issues further limits the likelihood that evidence-based policymaking will ultimately transform education in America: the com\u00adplexities inherent in conducting this kind of social science research.\r\n\r\nIn a twist on the familiar contrast between the hard sciences (\u201c[p]hys\u00adics, chemistry, geology, and so on\u201d) and the soft sciences (\u201cthe social sciences in general and education in particular\u201d), one education scholar instead contrasts the \u201c[h]ard-to-do science[s]\u201d (like social science in gen\u00aderal and education in particular) and the \u201c[e]asy-to-do science[s]\u201d (like physics, chemistry, and the rest).[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 18.[\/footnote] \u201cWe do our science under conditions that physical scientists find intolerable,\u201d wrote this education scholar, referring to messy, human, context-bound interactions.[footnote]Id.; see also Levin, supra note 140, at 4 (\u201c[K]nowledge about human behavior is in principle different from knowledge of the inanimate world\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Of course, even knowledge about the inanimate world has research challenges. See, e.g., Wendy E. Wagner, The Science Charade in Toxic Risk Regulation, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1613, 1619\u201322 (1995) (discussing \u201ctrans-science\u201d questions that can be hidden, intentionally or unintentionally, during the research process). These same challenges exist in education research.

Almost 14,000 school districts have different needs, populations, curricula, instructional practices, and governance structures.[footnote]Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Educ.

For example:\r\n<blockquote>Any teaching behavior interacts with a number of student char\u00adacteristics, including IQ, socioeconomic status, motivation to learn, and a host of other factors. Simultaneously, student be\u00adhavior is interacting with teacher characteristics, such as the teacher\u2019s training in the subject taught, conceptions of learning, beliefs about assessment, and even the teacher\u2019s personal happi\u00adness with life. But it doesn\u2019t end there because other variables interact with those just mentioned\u2014the curriculum materials, the socioeconomic status of the community, peer effects in the school, youth employment in the area, and so forth. Moreover, we are not even sure in which directions the influences work, and many surely are reciprocal.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Cohen et al., supra note 25, at 86\u201387 (dis\u00adcussing the difficulties of \u201cobservation and measurement of complex social and intellectu\u00adal processes\u201d involved in teaching).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIt is therefore difficult to isolate connections that might matter to a study\u2019s conclusions.\r\n\r\nA further challenge with conducting education research emerges from the difficulty of getting education decisionmakers to keep an intervention in place long enough to assess its value (even given the difficulties with assessment just discussed). Some interventions require long-term study,[footnote]See, e.g., Gueron, supra note 145, at 39 (\u201cThe life cycle of a major experiment or evaluation is often five or more years.\u201d); Vinovskis, History of Efforts, supra note 164, at 54 (describing an ideal \u201csystematic five-stage strategy for education research and develop\u00adment that would require 10\u201312 years to complete\u201d).[\/footnote] but decisionmakers often have short-term political needs that lead them to change a program before it has been fully implemented or assessed[footnote]See, e.g., Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201c[G]overnments have a propensity to change a program before outcomes have been assessed, so that any evaluation would thus be mea\u00adsuring moving targets with variable criteria of success.\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 152 (identifying \u201cprincipals\u2019 flagging interest in participating in a study\u201d as part of what brings \u201cdaunting, and arguably insurmountable, challenges\u201d to \u201crandomized controlled trials that focus on longitudinal change in schools\u201d).[\/footnote] or to \u201cinsist that measurable results be avail\u00adable in a short time-frame.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 84.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese challenges do not doom education (or broader social science) research, of course, but they do make it harder to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d in any straightforward sense.[footnote]For selected responses to this research challenge, see, e.g., Cook, supra note 152, at 131\u201332 (arguing that \u201cthe complexity and heterogeneity of schools leads to the need for larger school sample sizes and the need to anticipate and measure specific sources of varia\u00adtion to reduce their unwanted influence through statistical control\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 146 (arguing that a broader set of research methods than the randomized control trial\u2014\u201cqualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews\u201d\u2014is necessary in this context); Weiss, Politicization, supra note 161, at 62 (suggesting that in\u00adstead of \u201call-or-nothing, go\/no-go conclusions,\u201d researchers should attend to \u201cthe effec\u00adtiveness of variant conditions within programs\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and begin to explain which elements and sub-elements are associated with more or less success\u201d); Carol H.

In considering the utility of evidence-based policies in education and other social science fields, several scholars call for humility in the face of now-discredited but once widely held beliefs (about men and women, about race-based differences, about how children learn) that were based on research evidence.[footnote]See Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, An Elusive Science: The Troubling History of Ed\u00aducation Research 246 (2000) (\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, one can see the limitations of beliefs that once seemed indisputably true.\u201d); Berliner, supra note 135, at 20 (describing \u201cthe short half-life of [education research] findings\u201d in light of \u201cchanges in the social envi\u00adronment that invalidate the research or render it irrelevant\u201d); cf. Cecelia Klingele, The Promises and Perils of Evidence-Based Corrections, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 537, 575 (2016) (urging a similar humility in the context of correctional policy).[\/footnote] Recognizing that \u201c[r]esearch has been used to sup\u00adport positions that were later shown to be wrong or, even worse, are now considered morally repugnant, such as the supposed inferiority of some groups of people,\u201d suggests caution in assuming that the state of knowledge in the field provides scientifically valid answers simply because it is based on research evidence.[footnote]Levin, supra note 140, at 3.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nC. <em>The Research-to-Practice Dilemma<\/em>\r\n\r\nWhere high-quality, nonpartisan research findings exist, another challenge remains in translating these findings from research to prac\u00adtice.[footnote]See Lagemann, supra note 185, at 239\u201341 (explaining that the lack of a central\u00adized educational research community or organization has made it difficult to coordinate a research agenda that might aid policymakers).[\/footnote] Many implementation difficulties exist.[footnote]Cf.

As cuts to univer\u00adsity funding have driven researchers to find other sources of research support, foundations and business philanthropy have stepped in; but such sponsorship again raises questions about the neutrality of the research, because these institutions are sometimes affiliated with clear advocacy positions.[footnote]Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 6, 11\u201312 (noting that when university re\u00adsearchers rely on sponsored funding, it calls into question whether their research is truly independent); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 248 (noting the financial and reputa\u00adtional incentives for researchers to \u201cdepict [their] work in ways that the [supporting] or\u00adganizations will find congenial and to remain quiescent if they stretch the findings or recommendations in the course of their efforts\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, when academics engage on their own with education decisionmakers in the hope of making their research rele\u00advant,[footnote]See, e.g., Conaway, supra note 190, at 290 (arguing for this kind of collabora\u00adtion); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252 (discussing the value of building relation\u00adships between education researchers and the subjects of their studies).[\/footnote] the potential emerges for policy \u201ccapture\u201d that negatively affects the \u201cscope of research projects.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 86 (discussing the danger of such \u201ccapture\u201d when re\u00adsearchers \u201cengage closely with policy bureaucrats\u201d); Henig, Evolving Relationship, supra note 155, at 62 (questioning \u201chow far down the path of relevance researchers can travel without something of value being put at stake\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252\u201353 (discussing the challenges within researcher\u2013practitioner relationships).[\/footnote] From another direction, academics unaffiliated with any institution other than their home institution have sometimes been accused of conducting ideologically driven research anyway.[footnote]See Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 7 (tracing the development of conserva\u00adtive think tanks to the claim that \u201cliberal academics had some direct and indirect influ\u00adence on social policy\u201d).[\/footnote] Academics have also found their work captured without their knowing assistance.[footnote]See, e.g., Ingersoll, supra note 145, at 128\u201329 (discussing this experience).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther potential mediating institutions fare no better in the quest for neutrality. For example, the media sometimes report what turns out to be partisan think-tank work uncritically, strive for balance in presenting two sides of a story when facts lie only on one side, or hype researchers\u2019 divergent views to drum up readership.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey R.

Once we bring that question to the fore, it becomes clear that debates about evidence can sometimes be a cover for an underlying substantive disagreement about goals. Framing decisions as evidence based presents a danger that values-based decisions will be masked as neutral.[footnote]See Maris A. Vinovskis, Missing in Practice?

The Trump Administration is not going to be convinced to fund afterschool programs with a data dump of studies showing that the programs are successful. In\u00adstead, if the Administration changes its position on whether to fund a given program, it will be due to voters\u2019 moral outrage.[footnote]Cf. Michael Tonry, Making Peace, Not a Desert, 10 Criminology &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 637, 639 (2011) (\u201c[Contemporary crime-control] policies will be repudiated, or support for them weakened, only if enough of their proponents can be persuaded that they are unjust and cannot be morally justified.\u201d).[\/footnote] And that outrage is not going to be prompted by studies finding that the programs are success\u00adful\u2014if anything, such studies would be rejected as political.[footnote]See supra notes 161\u2013170 and accompanying text for discussion of responses to conflicting studies connected to ideological disagreement.[\/footnote] Appeals to values seem most likely to be successful to change the proposed policy.[footnote]See, e.g., Letter from David N. Cicilline &amp; Lou Barletta, Members of Cong., to Mick Mulvaney, Dir., Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget (Mar. 15, 2017), http:\/\/barletta.house.gov\/sites\/\r\nbarletta.house.gov\/files\/documents\/21st%20Century%20CLC%20OMB%20Letter.pdf [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/8UM7-FWBP] (asking President Trump to reinstate funding for after\u00adschool pro\u00adgrams based on appeals to values such as preventing turmoil for working families, promoting safety for kids, and allowing working parents to maintain jobs).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is also dangerous to frame policies that are really rooted in values as instead based on evidence because policies can take on a life of their own, sometimes ending up disconnected from, or even in opposition to, the values that originally prompted the policy.[footnote]Cf. Klingele, supra note 185, at 540\u201341 (\u201cAlthough most proponents of evidence-based correctional practices frame them as rehabilitative tools designed to reduce the use of incarceration and make correctional interventions more modest and humane, these tools are capable of doing the very opposite.\u201d).[\/footnote] Consider the rise of single-sex education over the last two decades. Early proponents included feminists who suggested that single-sex education could increase women\u2019s achievement.[footnote]See Rosemary Salomone, Rights and Wrongs in the Debate over Single-Sex Schooling, 93 B.U. L. Rev. 971, 976\u201377, 1027 (2013) (noting publications in the 1980s and 1990s that \u201creaffirmed the idea that American schools, overwhelmingly coed, were \u2018shortchanging\u2019 girls\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet they were soon joined by advocates peddling studies purporting to show differences in the way girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 brains learn; this development soon prompted schools to create single-sex classrooms to teach boys \u201cheroic behavior\u201d and allow them to run around while teach\u00ading girls \u201cgood character\u201d and encouraging them to sit while discussing their feelings.[footnote]See id. at 980\u201383.[\/footnote] Such policies entrench the very sex stereotypes that many of the original proponents of single-sex education intended to demolish.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when evidence is used ostensibly to justify a policy that ac\u00adtually stems from values, opponents of those values can use counterevi\u00addence to undercut the policy. For example, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education<\/em>, the Supreme Court famously (and controversially) relied in part on a study showing that black children preferred pink dolls to brown dolls to justify its ruling that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]347 U.S. 483, 494 &amp; n.11 (1954) (citing social science research to justify the prop\u00adosition that segregation \u201cwith the sanction of law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has a tendency to [retard] the educa\u00adtional and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the ben\u00adefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).[\/footnote] Segre\u00adgationists later used that same study to argue in favor of segregation, since the study showed that black children in segregated schools actually \u201cex\u00adhibited less negative reactions to the brown doll and showed less desire to play with the pink doll.\u201d[footnote]Joshua Dunn &amp; Martin West, Calculated Justice: Education Research and the Courts, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 155, 162\u201363.[\/footnote] So did the evidence show that it was better to maintain segregated schools? When values are in play, neither side is likely to convince the other side with a neutral appeal to evidence.[footnote]See, e.g., Lindblom &amp; Cohen, supra note 24, at 52 (connecting the perceived \u201cau\u00adthoritativeness\u201d of social science research for its users with the extent to which the research \u201csquares with their ideology or conforms to their general world view or epistemological position\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a debate among education scholars and practi\u00adtioners about what school reform should properly focus on: fixing the system as it exists, or reimagining the system entirely.[footnote]See, e.g., David Tyack &amp; Larry Cuban, Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform 1 (1995) (describing the tension in Americans\u2019 attitude toward school reform as one between \u201cutopian thinking\u201d and \u201ctinkering,\u201d each with both positive and neg\u00adative connotations).[\/footnote] Evidence is more likely to play a helpful role in the former than the latter.[footnote]See Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201cEvidence-based arguments about \u2018fine-tuning\u2019, based on careful research about effectiveness, might be more likely to gain traction in those areas that are away from the political heat.\u201d).[\/footnote] And tinkering can be valuable.[footnote]See, e.g., Tyack &amp; Cuban, supra note 243, at 10 (discussing \u201ca positive kind of tinkering, adapting knowledgeably to local needs and circumstances, preserving what is valuable and correcting what is not\u201d); cf.

Of course we should spend our limited public dollars on what works, and we should not spend our limited public dollars on what does not. The complexities outlined above do not indicate that we should disregard evidence or give up in despair on the research endeavor, believing that data exist only in the eye of the beholder or that we are each entitled to our own facts.[footnote]Cf. Majone, supra note 227, at 10\u201311 (\u201cEvidence is not synonymous with data or information\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

We must understand that the answer to the question of \u201cwhat works\u201d will al\u00adways be more complicated than a sound bite; research brooks no easy an\u00adswers, and implementation is messy. We must also understand that asking \u201cwhat works\u201d is itself a value-laden question. What works for what? For whom? To what end?[footnote]See Greenhalgh &amp; Russell, supra note 222, at 315 (\u201c[R]esearch evidence can and should inform policy judgments\u2014but this evidence does not in and of itself provide the answer to the ethical question of \u2018what to do\u2019 (and in particular, \u2018how to allocate resources\u2019).\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 253\u201354 (\u201cResearch has a vital role to play in demo\u00adcratic policy debate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to dictate outcomes or to presume that public officials should be the handmaidens of researchers, but to ensure that public decisionmaking is informed by all the facts, insights, and analyses that the tools of science can provide.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe authors of the important 2002 National Research Council report on scientific research in education referenced above argued that the \u201ccompelling culture of democratic accountability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. demands evidence that public monies are wisely spent.\u201d[footnote]See Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 5; see also supra text accompanying note 169.[\/footnote] This is true. But the compelling culture of democratic accountability also demands vigorous debate about the underlying goals to which public monies are put. We ought to high\u00adlight this debate whenever calls for evidence-based policymaking imply that technocratic, value-free solutions are only a research study away.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the invocations of evidence in ESSA. It is good to encourage decisionmakers to canvas their needs and examine what research might help them meet those needs. But evidence require\u00adments do not provide a meaningful way to constrain decisionmaking in education, nor are they likely to provide the answers that will fix the sys\u00adtem once and for all. We should not let a focus on evidence distract us from the democratic debate at the core of education. In conversations about the right path forward for education policy\u2014and other policies that form the fabric of our democracy\u2014we ignore discussions of values at our peril.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Perhaps a requirement for evidence will limit the White House and the Department of Education from making ideologically driven choices[footnote]See, e.g., Frederick M.

It is also not likely that these requirements will themselves result in significant im\u00adprovements to education in America or resolve raging debates about the best way to engage in school reform.\r\n\r\nWhy not? First, as Part I illustrates, although ESSA\u2019s references to evi\u00addence-based decisionmaking are numerous, its actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking are anything but stringent.[footnote]See infra section I.A. [\/footnote] The Depart\u00adment of Education, states, and school districts retain many opportunities to push their preferred policy choices.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Part II lays out, requirements to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d overestimate the current knowledge base and potential for future research, and they underestimate the challenges of implementation in the messy, human endeavor of teaching and learning that goes on every day in thousands of jurisdictions all over America. While the analysis in this Part focuses on education research, the critiques apply more broadly to social science research in general.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Part III explains, the elusive search for \u201cwhat works\u201d can obscure critical and often contested values-based decisions about what we should be trying to do in the first place and about necessary tradeoffs along the way. This Part, too, focuses on education policy, but the argument extends broadly to other kinds of social policy.\r\n\r\nThis Essay should not be read as a critique of the evidence require\u00adments in ESSA but rather as a caution against the fetishization of evi\u00addence in social science policymaking more generally. Too often, policy\u00admakers envision what evaluation scholars call an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d for evidence, in which research will provide an uncontested answer to a clear policy problem.[footnote]Cynthia E. Coburn, Meredith I. Honig &amp; Mary Kay Stein, What\u2019s the Evidence on Districts\u2019 Use of Evidence?, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement 67, 75 (John D. Bransford, Deborah J. Stipek, Nancy J. Vye, Louis M. Gomez &amp; Diana Lam eds., 2009).[\/footnote] But research findings almost never provide a straight\u00adforward answer about what to do,[footnote]See infra notes 141\u2013186 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] and decisions about education and other social policies are enmeshed in a complex web of political realities, institutional capacities, and societal values.[footnote]See infra notes 222\u2013249 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Too often, then, decision\u00admakers on the ground end up using evidence in what evaluation scholars call a \u201csymbolic\u201d way, \u201ccreat[ing] legitimacy for solutions that are already favored or even enacted,\u201d thereby largely undermining the point of requiring evidence-based decisions in the first place.[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 77.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nInstead, evidence plays the most valuable role as what evaluation scholars call a \u201cconceptual\u201d tool.[footnote]See id. at 76\u201377.[\/footnote] In the words of Carol Weiss, a pioneer\u00ading scholar in the evaluation of social policy:\r\n<blockquote>Social research can be \u201cused\u201d in reconceptualizing the charac\u00adter of policy issues or even redefining the policy agenda. Thus, social research may sensitize decisionmakers to new issues and turn what were nonproblems into policy problems\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In turn, it may convert existing social problems into nonproblems\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It may drastically revise the way that a society thinks about issues\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. , the facets of an issue that are viewed as susceptible to alteration, and the alternative measures that it considers.[footnote]Charles E. Lindblom &amp; David K. Cohen, Usable Knowledge: Social Science and Social Problem Solving 77 (1979) (quoting Carol H. Weiss, Introduction, <em>in<\/em> Using Social Research in Public Policy Making 1, 15\u201316 (Carol. H. Weiss ed., 1972)); see also Kathryn E. Newcomer, Carol H. Weiss, Evaluation Research: Methods for Studying Programs and Poli\u00adcies, <em>in<\/em> The Oxford Handbook of Classics in Public Policy and Administration 326, 326\u201341 (Steven J. Balla, Martin Lodge &amp; Edward C. Page eds., 2015) (analyzing Weiss\u2019s influential work in the field of evaluation theory and practice).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nEvidence can more usefully change the way we think about a prob\u00adlem of social policy than it can tell us what to do about that problem.[footnote]See, e.g., Lindblom &amp; Cohen, supra note 24, at 48 (noting that research typically \u201craise[s] new issues, stimulate[s] new debate, and multipl[ies] the complexities of the social problem at hand\u201d); David K. Cohen, Stephen W. Raudenbush &amp; Deborah Loewenberg Ball, Resources, Instruction, and Research, <em>in<\/em> Evidence Matters: Randomized Trials in Ed\u00aducation Research 80, 117 (Frederick Mosteller &amp; Robert Boruch eds., 2002) [hereinafter Evidence Matters] (noting that research can \u201cinform[] thought and debate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [and] might tend to close out unfruitful arguments as well as highlight new problems\u201d); Frederick M. Hess, Conclusion: Education Research and Public Policy, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 239, 256 [hereinafter Hess, Conclusion] (\u201c[R]esearch cannot provide all the answers officials seek\u2014but is frequently most valuable when it helps shed[] new light on problems and favored solutions.\u201d).[\/footnote] In this way, it is an important part of policy analysis. But it should be viewed as only one component of the democratic deliberation and political con\u00adtestation in which education, like other social policies, is rooted.\r\n\r\nThe focus on evidence-based policymaking in education has some valuable aspects, then, but it should not be seen as a panacea or as a neutral, technocratic solution. Evidence alone is insufficient to resolve complex social problems with contested underlying values and goals, and we ought not expect that it will.\r\n<h2>I. The Limits of the Law<\/h2>\r\nNotwithstanding the frequency of their appearance, the evidence re\u00adquirements in ESSA are limited.[footnote]See infra section I.A.[\/footnote] The Department of Education, states, and local school districts have many opportunities to promote whatever policies they would like to promote for whatever reason.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>A. ESSA\u2019s Instructions for the Use of Evidence<\/h3>\r\nESSA refers to evidence numerous times throughout its thousand pages.

ESSA contains other, smaller formula grants, as well as a wide variety of competitive grants, but as section I.A.4 explains below, the focus on evidence in these grants is permissive rather than mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for evidence-based practices appear in only two places in Title I: in the development of school districts\u2019 plans to engage parents and families,[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(b)(7), 6318(a)(2)(E) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] and in the development of school \u201csupport and improvement plan[s]\u201d for a small group of schools that are not adequately meeting the state\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] Neither of these require\u00adments is broadly systemic.\r\n\r\nThe first of these activities\u2014designing parent engagement plans\u2014is not a central part of the Act; it is merely one of twenty-odd things a local school district must include in its application to receive a subgrant under ESSA from the state.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a), (b)(7).[\/footnote] There is no real consequence for failure to do any of the things the school districts say they will do in asking for their sub\u00adgrant.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(a)(5), 6318(h) (providing for local review but not state conse\u00adquences); see also Pasachoff, Agency Enforcement, supra note 37, at 284 (describing infre\u00adquency of funding cut-offs for a grantee\u2019s noncompliance with terms of a grant).[\/footnote] The requirement for the parent engagement plan to explain how the school district will conduct a needs assessment and then use the findings \u201cto design evidence-based strategies for more effective parental involve\u00adment\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(D)\u2013(E).[\/footnote] thus cannot be seen as transformative or constraining in any way.\r\n\r\nThe second of these activities\u2014designing school improvement plans\u2014is a much bigger deal, as these plans are core to the accountability re\u00adgime that lies at the center of the Act.[footnote]See, e.g., Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 115\u201317, 124\u201326) (contrasting NCLB and ESSA accountability regimes as the central parts of each Act).[\/footnote] Here, too, however, the calls for evidence-based interventions are not that significant.\r\n\r\nThere are two situations in which school improvement plans are re\u00adquired. The first situation is narrower, based on low achievement of one or more \u201csubgroups\u201d in a school.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2).[\/footnote] \u201cSubgroup of students\u201d is a term of art in the statute, as it was in No Child Left Behind,[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) (2002).[\/footnote] meaning \u201ceconomi\u00adcally disadvantaged students,\u201d \u201cstudents from major racial and ethnic groups,\u201d \u201cchildren with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cEnglish learners.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(2) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] For all schools in which one or more of these subgroups \u201care consistently underper\u00adforming\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A)(ii).[\/footnote] under the state\u2019s accountability requirements\u2014test scores, graduation rates for high schools, progress in achieving English profi\u00adciency, and any \u201cother indicator of school quality or student success\u201d that the state wishes to adopt[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(B)\u2013(C).[\/footnote]\u2014the state educational agency must inform the local school district of these schools\u2019 existence and must ensure that the school district in turn notifies the schools.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A).[\/footnote] Each school must then work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a \u201ctargeted support and im\u00adprovement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to remedy the problem for the relevant subgroup(s).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(B).[\/footnote] This targeted plan must then be approved and subsequently monitored by the school district.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second situation that requires a school improvement plan is broader, based on the performance of the school as a whole.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1).[\/footnote] For at least those schools that perform the worst in the state on tests or on high school graduation rates, as well as for those schools in which a subgroup\u2019s performance on its own would rank at the bottom of the state\u2019s perform\u00adance requirements,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(D)(i).[\/footnote] the state educational agency must again identify these schools to their school district.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Now, instead of simply notifying the schools that they must implement an improvement plan, the school dis\u00adtrict itself has to work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a school-level \u201ccomprehensive support and improvement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to fix the school\u2019s achievement problems.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] This comprehensive plan must be approved not only by the individual school and school district but also by the state educational agency,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(v).[\/footnote] which must also then monitor its implementation.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(vi).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese provisions constitute the sum total of the evidence requirements in the Act. Note the limited categories of schools and stu\u00addents to which the more significant requirements\u2014those for school im\u00adprovement plans\u2014apply. The requirements apply only to decisions about how to respond to the persistently low performance of certain subsets of children and ex\u00adtremely small percentages of schools. While this is an im\u00adportant category of children and schools, these requirements are simply not going to significantly transform or constrain the education decisions of states, dis\u00adtricts, and schools as a whole.[footnote]Cf. Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 125\u201326) (criticizing ESSA\u2019s accountability regime for applying to \u201calmost no one,\u201d and describing requirements for evidence-based interventions as positive but nonetheless \u201crelatively mi\u00adnor\u201d in light of the vast flexibility otherwise granted to states).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Generous Definitions of Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 To be sure, these requirements could, in principle, play a dramatic role for the neediest children and schools if the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d itself imposed meaningful constraints on decisionmaking. That is, if \u201cevidence-based\u201d closed off a significant universe of options, then it could indeed be constraining. But it does not.\r\n\r\nThe statute devotes several paragraphs to a definition of the term \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)\u2013(B).[\/footnote] ESSA presents four possible ways, with different de\u00adgrees of strenuousness, by which an entity may show that \u201can activity, strategy, or intervention\u201d is \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe three most demanding ways require a grantee to \u201cdemonstrate[] a statistically significant effect on improving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes,\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i).[\/footnote] with different tiers of evidence required to make that showing: There must be either (1) \u201cstrong evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented experimental study\u201d; (2) \u201cmoderate evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented quasi-exper\u00adimental study\u201d; or (3) \u201cpromising evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III).[\/footnote] These are the tiers of evidence that must apply to the school improvement plans and related state activities for the lowest-achieving schools and student subgroups.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth, less demanding tier of evidence. To be evidence based under this tier, an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention\u201d need not be statistically significant, but must merely \u201cdemonstrate[] a rationale based on high-quality research findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(I).[\/footnote] Such an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention,\u201d if se\u00adlected by an educational authority, must also \u201cinclude[] ongoing efforts to examine the effects of such activity, strategy, or intervention.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(II).[\/footnote] This fourth tier is applicable to the requirement for evidence in developing parent and family engagement plans; such plans may be based on evi\u00addence in one of the top three tiers, but need not be, as long as they are based on evidence that would satisfy this fourth tier.[footnote]Compare id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B) (defining \u201cevidence-based\u201d activities as only those that satisfy one of the top three tiers of evidence), with id. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(E) (imposing no such limitation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs Part II below will make clear, it is not difficult to find evidence to support a vast range of educational interventions under these definitions, even under the top three tiers that are applicable to school improvement plans. Tier three (\u201cpromising evidence\u201d) and tier four (a \u201crationale\u201d with a promise to assess it as implemented) are especially easy to meet. To be sure, the commitment that grantees make under tier four to engage in ongoing assessment of their activities could encourage them to make better decisions\u2014but the reality is that only those grantees who already want to engage in the process of continuous improvement are likely to take this opportunity seriously.[footnote]See West, supra note 31 (noting \u201c[t]hose six words [\u201c\u2018ongoing efforts to examine the effects\u2019 of the activity on important student outcomes\u201d], if taken seriously and imple\u00admented with care, hold the potential to create and provide resources to sustain a new model for decision-making within state agencies and school districts,\u201d but \u201c[t]he oppor\u00adtunity to use federal funds for evaluation purposes will only make a difference if state offi\u00adcials choose to exploit it.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to the extent ESSA\u2019s evidence requirements include con\u00adstraints, the constraints are not on determining what state, district, and school educational goals should be, but only on how to achieve those goals. Because ESSA as a whole is shot through with providing substan\u00adtive discretion to states, districts, and schools,[footnote]Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 127\u201329).[\/footnote] the statute\u2019s evidence def\u00adinitions do little to limit policy choices.\r\n\r\n4. <em>Other, Broadly Permissive References to Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 Beyond the par\u00adent engagement plans and the school improvement plans in Title I, the other references to evidence in ESSA are all permissive rather than man\u00addatory.

These provisions may refer to evidence, then, but they are hardly constraining.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of references to evidence in ESSA\u2019s competitive grants. While certain competitive grants encourage applicants to embed evidence-based activities in their programs, the encouragement is not particularly strenuous. For example, some grants provide \u201cpriority points\u201d for applicants who can demonstrate that their proposed activities are sup\u00adported by evidence from the top three tiers, but they do not require ap\u00adplicants to make such a demonstration.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06642(e) (grants for \u201c[c]omprehensive literacy State development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06672(e) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(e) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07243(c) (grants for \u201cstate\u00adwide family engagement centers\u201d); id \u00a7\u00a07274(b) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(b) (grants for \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(f) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-ability learners and learning\u201d); see also id. \u00a7\u00a07231e(2)(A) (listing evi\u00addence-based projects as one of several ways applicants for grants to support magnet schools may establish priority).[\/footnote] Some further limit a portion (but not all) of any federal funds awarded to those activities that are gen\u00aderally \u201cevidence-based\u201d (including the bottom tier of evidence).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06672(a)(2), (5) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(a)(6) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07242,\u00a07243(b)(6)(G) (grants for \u201cstatewide family engagement centers\u201d).[\/footnote] Some also require ongoing evaluation of the extent to which the grant pro\u00adgrams are successful.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07274(h), (i) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(f), (g) (grants for \u201c[f]ull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(h) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-abil\u00adity learners and learning\u201d).[\/footnote] One is designed to encourage broad efforts to \u201ccreate, develop, implement, replicate, or take to scale entrepreneurial, evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement and attain\u00adment for high-need students.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07261(a)(1)(A) (grants for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo embed incentives for evidence across numerous multimillion dollar grants is not nothing.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06603(b) (authorizing close to $500 million each year for a variety of competitive grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07246 (authorizing $10 million each year for another competi\u00adtive grant); id. \u00a7\u00a07251(a) (authorizing between $200 and $221 million each year for an\u00adother set of competitive grants).[\/footnote] But nor is it everything. There remain many competitive grants in ESSA that do not require any particular evidence-based decisionmaking to support an application.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06662 (grants for \u201cPresidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07221b(g) (grants to support \u201chigh-quality charter schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07281 (grants for \u201c[n]ational activities for school safety\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07292 (grants for \u201cassistance for arts education\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07293 (grants for \u201c[r]eady to learn programming\u201d).[\/footnote] The eligible entities for some of the grants encouraging evidence-based thinking are not even state educational authorities, school districts, or schools,[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06672(f) (including institutions of higher education and nonprofits as eligible entities for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07261(b) (including nonprofits acting on their own as well as a governmental agency acting in partnership with a nonprofit, a business, \u201can educational service agency,\u201d or \u201can institu\u00adtion of higher education\u201d as eligible entities for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07272(1) (including institutions of higher education as well as nonprofits working in partnership with certain other entities as eligible entities for \u201c[p]romise neigh\u00adborhood[]\u201d grants, and including a consortium of community-based organizations or nonprofit organizations as eligible entities for \u201cfull-service community school[]\u201d grants).[\/footnote] so the effect of these evidence requirements on the nation\u2019s core educational institutions is further diluted. And, of course, the nature of competitive grants is that not every eligible entity will apply, and certainly not every entity that ap\u00adplies will win one.\r\n\r\nThe permissive references to evidence throughout ESSA thus may do more to express a mood than to provide an actual set of transforma\u00adtive constraints.\r\n<h3>B. Opportunities to Find, Promote, and Use Evidence as Desired\u2014Or to Ignore It<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the lack of constraints imposed by ESSA\u2019s references to evidence, it is worth considering the ways in which the states and the fed\u00aderal government can continue to push their own policy prefer\u00adences within the bounds of the law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>State Choices.<\/em> \u2014 Because states are the primary recipients of fund\u00ading under ESSA\u2014most local money is allocated through subgrants[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a)(1) (authorizing subgrants to local school districts).[\/footnote]\u2014state authority to steer school districts and schools toward state priorities for education is significant.\r\n\r\nAs should be clear from the discussion of ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions above, there are major parts of the Act that simply require no evidence whatsoever. States need not justify their standards with respect to any evi\u00addence of what works.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(A) (detailing requirements for \u201cchallenging\u201d standards without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] The same is true of their tests,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B) (detailing requirements for \u201chigh-quality\u201d assess\u00adments without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their teacher cer\u00adtification plans,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(2)(J) (detailing assurances a state must offer on teacher certifica\u00adtion without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote] their plans for teaching English learners[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(1)(F), (b)(2)(G) (detailing requirements for standards and as\u00adsessments for English learners without requiring any evidentiary basis).[\/footnote]\u2014the list goes on.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311 (detailing requirements for state plans in general but including evi\u00addence requirements only at \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)\u2013(2)); see also supra notes 51\u201361 and accompa\u00adnying text (describing these evidence requirements).[\/footnote] States can simply make assertions in their applications for formula grants about how they plan to work on these issues without examining any research evidence first.[footnote]See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(g)(1)\u2013(2) (detailing descriptions states must offer and assur\u00adances they must provide without requiring any consultation of evidence).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat some aspects of the Act call for evidence while others do not is notable. It might suggest that some aspects of education are too compli\u00adcated to demand evidence for; that in some categories of action, federal\u00adism trumps evidence; or simply that political dealmaking reached the median voter here. Whatever the reason, it is clear that in vast swaths of their educational undertakings, states need not examine research but may simply make policy choices.\r\n\r\nWhen states do have to use research evidence, ESSA also provides numerous opportunities for states to require districts and schools to adopt whatever evidence-based interventions the state prioritizes.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(3)(B)(ii).[\/footnote] This type of activity illustrates what evaluation scholars call a \u201csanctioning role\u201d for evidence, when state or federal agencies deem particular inter\u00adventions \u201c\u2018research-based\u2019 and thus approved for use with state or federal funds.\u201d[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 75, 78.[\/footnote] Here, too, then, states are empowered to select the evidence they find most persuasive to support the interventions they want to sup\u00adport anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother way states can specify the evidence-based interventions they prefer is designing criteria for ESSA\u2019s school improvement subgrants to local educational agencies.[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06303(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] Controlling the purse strings provides au\u00adthority to make policy choices without much constraint from the require\u00adment for evidence.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Federal Choices.<\/em> \u2014 There are numerous ways in which the Trump Administration can implement ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions while still push\u00ading its own agenda, whether through regulation, nonregulatory guid\u00adance, grant competitions, or the budget process.\r\n\r\nConsider first the role of regulation. Shortly before leaving office, the Obama Administration promulgated a final rule to implement the Act\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86,076 (Nov. 29, 2016) (disapproved by Act of Mar. 27, 2017, Pub. L.

Nothing would require states, districts, and schools to select these choices, but it is reasonable to imagine that at least some will find it easier to use what the Administration is promoting.[footnote]Others, of course, may prefer to avoid any strategy that the Trump Administra\u00adtion promotes (just as in the Obama era, the reverse may have been true for a differently aligned set of political actors), but at least some will just select from the offered list. See, e.g., Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 78 (describing a study in which several districts chose programs from a list without \u201cparticularly support[ing] [those programs] solely as a way to maintain their federal funding\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother way an administration can use the regulatory process to put its stamp on evidence is to clarify the definition of that term. For example, in 2013, as part of the Obama Administration\u2019s effort to pro\u00admote evidence-based policymaking more generally,[footnote]See supra note 6 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the Department of Education revised its General Administrative Regulations to include for the first time a detailed definition of evidence that it could use in the competitive grant application process.[footnote]Compare Direct Grant Programs and Definitions that Apply to Department Regu\u00adlations, 78 Fed. Reg. 49,338, 49,355\u201356 (Aug. 13, 2013) (revising, inter alia, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a077.1, the section on definitions, and including definitions of terms relevant to evidence), with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a077.1 (2012) (including no definitions of terms relevant to evidence).[\/footnote] The Trump Administration re\u00adcently issued a final rule making technical changes to these definitions to conform to the language in ESSA,[footnote]See Definitions and Selection Criteria that Apply to Direct Grant Programs, 82 Fed.

See Exec. Order No. 13,777, 82 Fed.

For example, in 2016, the Obama accountability rules placed an additional limit on how to estab\u00adlish that interventions in school improvement plans under ESSA would be evidence based: It would not be acceptable to pick an intervention that is justified only by a lower tier of evidence if an intervention justified by a higher tier of evidence would also be appropriate.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86,076, 86,231 (Nov. 29, 2016) (disapproved by Act of Mar. 27, 2017, Pub. L.

This ab\u00adsence further opens the door for the Trump Administration to push its own policy choices more generally, even if supported by weaker evidence.\r\n\r\nNonregulatory guidance provides one opportunity to do so. Several months before the Obama Administration issued the accountability regu\u00adlations in November 2016, it issued nonregulatory guidance on using evi\u00addence.[footnote]U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Educa\u00adtion Investments (2016) [hereinafter U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Using Evidence], http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/\r\npolicy\/elsec\/leg\/essa\/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/A2T5-8GL5].[\/footnote] That guidance contained detailed recommendations for how states, districts, and schools should identify evidence at each of ESSA\u2019s four tiers.[footnote]Id. at 8\u20139.[\/footnote] Most importantly, the guidance explains that, while the stat\u00adutory definition of evidence-based requires only \u201cat least one study,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted) (paraphrasing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2015)).[\/footnote] stakeholders in fact \u201cshould consider the entire body of relevant evi\u00addence\u201d and should not choose interventions that only one study supports if there are other equally strong studies that reach the opposite conclusion about the intervention.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs of October 2017, that guidance document is still on the Trump Department of Education\u2019s website,[footnote]See U.S. Dep\u2019t Educ., Using Evidence, supra note 113 (providing a permalink that captured the document as of October 20, 2017).[\/footnote] but rescinding that guidance docu\u00adment would be one way for the Trump Administration to put its mark on the interventions it wants states, districts, and schools to select.

Rev. 766, 766--67 (2010) (describing limitation riders as \u201can effective tool for congressional influence over . . . bureaucratic policy making\u201d).[\/footnote] or informally in legislative history during the appropriations pro\u00adcess, how it wants the Department to allocate funds.[footnote]See, e.g., Schick, supra note 128,\u00a0 at 136 (discussing legislative history).[\/footnote] Nothing in ESSA\u2019s embrace of evidence would restrict the budget process from un\u00addercutting that embrace.\r\n\r\nFor all of these reasons, then, ESSA\u2019s focus on evidence, both on the face of the law and in its operation, does little to meaningfully limit the pol\u00adicy options available to the Department of Education and the states.\r\n<h2>II. The Limits of the Research<\/h2>\r\nEven if ESSA\u2019s language were tightened, however, challenges would remain, for no provision requiring evidence-based decisionmaking is likely to dramatically improve education in America. The hope that evidence will drive such a transformation stems from \u201cassum[ptions] that evidence is clear, unambiguous, and available; that decision makers use evidence in an instrumental fashion, weighing the merits of alternate courses of action and choosing the solutions that best fit the problem; and there\u00adfore that evidence leads directly to decisions.\u201d[footnote]Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 69.[\/footnote] As this Part demonstrates, however, these assumptions turn out to be wrong, in light of limits in the state of the research, difficulties in conducting this kind of social science research in the first place, and challenges in implementing what research findings exist.\r\n<h3>A. The Small and Contested Research Base<\/h3>\r\nAs two leading education funders and former federal officials wrote almost a decade into the No Child Left Behind era, \u201c[G]iven the amount of paper and breath expended on the various pedagogical \u2018wars,\u2019 one might think that by now there would be more definitive knowledge and agree\u00adment on what to do.\u201d[footnote]Frederic A. Mosher &amp; Marshall S. Smith<em>, <\/em>The Role of Research in Education Re\u00adform from the Perspective of Federal Policymakers and Foundation Grantmakers, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement, supra note 19, at 19, 32.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat having been said, there is no doubt that the quality and quan\u00adtity of research in education have exploded over the course of the last two decades. In large part, this development was prompted by incentives in federal law. Reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00adcation Act (ESEA) of 1965 and additional stand-alone legislation dating back to 1988 started to encourage a focus on finding and implementing effective programs.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin Michael Superfine, New Directions in School Funding and Governance: Moving from Politics to Evidence, 98 Ky. L.J. 653, 678\u201380 (2010) (describing this history); see also Michael J. Feuer, Lisa Towne &amp; Richard J. Shavelson, Scientific Culture and Educational Research, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 4, 4\u20136 (comparing this history to other fields).[\/footnote] This focus reached a high point in 2002, when Congress reauthorized the ESEA as NCLB, which required numerous in\u00adterventions relying on \u201cscientifically based research,\u201d[footnote]The term \u201cscientifically based research\u201d appeared 111 times in NCLB. See Kamina Aliya Pinder, Using Federal Law to Prescribe Pedagogy: Lessons Learned from the Scien\u00adtifically-Based Research Requirements of No Child Left Behind, 6 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 47, 59 (2008). NCLB\u2019s definition of \u201cscientific research\u201d was controversial, as it seemed to limit acceptable forms of research to randomized control trials. See, e.g., David C. Berliner, Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 18, 18 (critiquing NCLB\u2019s definition). ESSA\u2019s expansion of the phrase \u201cevidence-based\u201d to in\u00adclude four tiers of research instead of just the top tier is in part a response to these cri\u00adtiques. See West, supra note 31 (explaining the difference between ESSA\u2019s evidence re\u00adquirements and NCLB\u2019s \u201cscientifically based research\u201d).[\/footnote] and then subse\u00adquently passed the Education Sciences Reform Act, which expanded and institutionalized the federal infrastructure for funding and encouraging education research.[footnote]See Superfine, supra note 134, at 692 (calling the Education Sciences Reform Act \u201ca reasoned response to the inconsistent quality of educational research and the lack of a solid evidentiary base for making effective educational funding decisions,\u201d while also not\u00ading its \u201cfail[ure] to account for the complex and heavily contextualized nature of educa\u00adtion\u201d).

Despite critiques that NCLB\u2019s focus on experiments was too narrow a conception of what scientifically based research should be, see supra note 135, the 2002 laws led to an expansion in experiments in education.

Many researchers do not view this fact with des\u00adpair but rather see it as an expected part of conducting high-quality research. See, e.g., Judith M.

When the government promotes evidence-based deci\u00adsionmaking but does not seem neutral in so doing, it can be hard to see evidence itself as anything other than political.\r\n<h3>B. The Complexities of Education Research<\/h3>\r\nAnother set of issues further limits the likelihood that evidence-based policymaking will ultimately transform education in America: the com\u00adplexities inherent in conducting this kind of social science research.\r\n\r\nIn a twist on the familiar contrast between the hard sciences (\u201c[p]hys\u00adics, chemistry, geology, and so on\u201d) and the soft sciences (\u201cthe social sciences in general and education in particular\u201d), one education scholar instead contrasts the \u201c[h]ard-to-do science[s]\u201d (like social science in gen\u00aderal and education in particular) and the \u201c[e]asy-to-do science[s]\u201d (like physics, chemistry, and the rest).[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 18.[\/footnote] \u201cWe do our science under conditions that physical scientists find intolerable,\u201d wrote this education scholar, referring to messy, human, context-bound interactions.[footnote]Id.; see also Levin, supra note 140, at 4 (\u201c[K]nowledge about human behavior is in principle different from knowledge of the inanimate world\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Of course, even knowledge about the inanimate world has research challenges. See, e.g., Wendy E. Wagner, The Science Charade in Toxic Risk Regulation, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1613, 1619\u201322 (1995) (discussing \u201ctrans-science\u201d questions that can be hidden, intentionally or unintentionally, during the research process). These same challenges exist in education research.

Almost 14,000 school districts have different needs, populations, curricula, instructional practices, and governance structures.[footnote]Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Educ.

For example:\r\n<blockquote>Any teaching behavior interacts with a number of student char\u00adacteristics, including IQ, socioeconomic status, motivation to learn, and a host of other factors. Simultaneously, student be\u00adhavior is interacting with teacher characteristics, such as the teacher\u2019s training in the subject taught, conceptions of learning, beliefs about assessment, and even the teacher\u2019s personal happi\u00adness with life. But it doesn\u2019t end there because other variables interact with those just mentioned\u2014the curriculum materials, the socioeconomic status of the community, peer effects in the school, youth employment in the area, and so forth. Moreover, we are not even sure in which directions the influences work, and many surely are reciprocal.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Cohen et al., supra note 25, at 86\u201387 (dis\u00adcussing the difficulties of \u201cobservation and measurement of complex social and intellectu\u00adal processes\u201d involved in teaching).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIt is therefore difficult to isolate connections that might matter to a study\u2019s conclusions.\r\n\r\nA further challenge with conducting education research emerges from the difficulty of getting education decisionmakers to keep an intervention in place long enough to assess its value (even given the difficulties with assessment just discussed). Some interventions require long-term study,[footnote]See, e.g., Gueron, supra note 145, at 39 (\u201cThe life cycle of a major experiment or evaluation is often five or more years.\u201d); Vinovskis, History of Efforts, supra note 164, at 54 (describing an ideal \u201csystematic five-stage strategy for education research and develop\u00adment that would require 10\u201312 years to complete\u201d).[\/footnote] but decisionmakers often have short-term political needs that lead them to change a program before it has been fully implemented or assessed[footnote]See, e.g., Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201c[G]overnments have a propensity to change a program before outcomes have been assessed, so that any evaluation would thus be mea\u00adsuring moving targets with variable criteria of success.\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 152 (identifying \u201cprincipals\u2019 flagging interest in participating in a study\u201d as part of what brings \u201cdaunting, and arguably insurmountable, challenges\u201d to \u201crandomized controlled trials that focus on longitudinal change in schools\u201d).[\/footnote] or to \u201cinsist that measurable results be avail\u00adable in a short time-frame.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 84.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese challenges do not doom education (or broader social science) research, of course, but they do make it harder to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d in any straightforward sense.[footnote]For selected responses to this research challenge, see, e.g., Cook, supra note 152, at 131\u201332 (arguing that \u201cthe complexity and heterogeneity of schools leads to the need for larger school sample sizes and the need to anticipate and measure specific sources of varia\u00adtion to reduce their unwanted influence through statistical control\u201d); Lareau, supra note 177, at 146 (arguing that a broader set of research methods than the randomized control trial\u2014\u201cqualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews\u201d\u2014is necessary in this context); Weiss, Politicization, supra note 161, at 62 (suggesting that in\u00adstead of \u201call-or-nothing, go\/no-go conclusions,\u201d researchers should attend to \u201cthe effec\u00adtiveness of variant conditions within programs\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and begin to explain which elements and sub-elements are associated with more or less success\u201d); Carol H.

In considering the utility of evidence-based policies in education and other social science fields, several scholars call for humility in the face of now-discredited but once widely held beliefs (about men and women, about race-based differences, about how children learn) that were based on research evidence.[footnote]See Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, An Elusive Science: The Troubling History of Ed\u00aducation Research 246 (2000) (\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, one can see the limitations of beliefs that once seemed indisputably true.\u201d); Berliner, supra note 135, at 20 (describing \u201cthe short half-life of [education research] findings\u201d in light of \u201cchanges in the social envi\u00adronment that invalidate the research or render it irrelevant\u201d); cf. Cecelia Klingele, The Promises and Perils of Evidence-Based Corrections, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 537, 575 (2016) (urging a similar humility in the context of correctional policy).[\/footnote] Recognizing that \u201c[r]esearch has been used to sup\u00adport positions that were later shown to be wrong or, even worse, are now considered morally repugnant, such as the supposed inferiority of some groups of people,\u201d suggests caution in assuming that the state of knowledge in the field provides scientifically valid answers simply because it is based on research evidence.[footnote]Levin, supra note 140, at 3.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nC. <em>The Research-to-Practice Dilemma<\/em>\r\n\r\nWhere high-quality, nonpartisan research findings exist, another challenge remains in translating these findings from research to prac\u00adtice.[footnote]See Lagemann, supra note 185, at 239\u201341 (explaining that the lack of a central\u00adized educational research community or organization has made it difficult to coordinate a research agenda that might aid policymakers).[\/footnote] Many implementation difficulties exist.[footnote]Cf.

As cuts to univer\u00adsity funding have driven researchers to find other sources of research support, foundations and business philanthropy have stepped in; but such sponsorship again raises questions about the neutrality of the research, because these institutions are sometimes affiliated with clear advocacy positions.[footnote]Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 6, 11\u201312 (noting that when university re\u00adsearchers rely on sponsored funding, it calls into question whether their research is truly independent); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 248 (noting the financial and reputa\u00adtional incentives for researchers to \u201cdepict [their] work in ways that the [supporting] or\u00adganizations will find congenial and to remain quiescent if they stretch the findings or recommendations in the course of their efforts\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, when academics engage on their own with education decisionmakers in the hope of making their research rele\u00advant,[footnote]See, e.g., Conaway, supra note 190, at 290 (arguing for this kind of collabora\u00adtion); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252 (discussing the value of building relation\u00adships between education researchers and the subjects of their studies).[\/footnote] the potential emerges for policy \u201ccapture\u201d that negatively affects the \u201cscope of research projects.\u201d[footnote]Head, supra note 163, at 86 (discussing the danger of such \u201ccapture\u201d when re\u00adsearchers \u201cengage closely with policy bureaucrats\u201d); Henig, Evolving Relationship, supra note 155, at 62 (questioning \u201chow far down the path of relevance researchers can travel without something of value being put at stake\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 252\u201353 (discussing the challenges within researcher\u2013practitioner relationships).[\/footnote] From another direction, academics unaffiliated with any institution other than their home institution have sometimes been accused of conducting ideologically driven research anyway.[footnote]See Anderson et al., supra note 195, at 7 (tracing the development of conserva\u00adtive think tanks to the claim that \u201cliberal academics had some direct and indirect influ\u00adence on social policy\u201d).[\/footnote] Academics have also found their work captured without their knowing assistance.[footnote]See, e.g., Ingersoll, supra note 145, at 128\u201329 (discussing this experience).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther potential mediating institutions fare no better in the quest for neutrality. For example, the media sometimes report what turns out to be partisan think-tank work uncritically, strive for balance in presenting two sides of a story when facts lie only on one side, or hype researchers\u2019 divergent views to drum up readership.[footnote]See, e.g., Jeffrey R.

Once we bring that question to the fore, it becomes clear that debates about evidence can sometimes be a cover for an underlying substantive disagreement about goals. Framing decisions as evidence based presents a danger that values-based decisions will be masked as neutral.[footnote]See Maris A. Vinovskis, Missing in Practice?

The Trump Administration is not going to be convinced to fund afterschool programs with a data dump of studies showing that the programs are successful. In\u00adstead, if the Administration changes its position on whether to fund a given program, it will be due to voters\u2019 moral outrage.[footnote]Cf. Michael Tonry, Making Peace, Not a Desert, 10 Criminology &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 637, 639 (2011) (\u201c[Contemporary crime-control] policies will be repudiated, or support for them weakened, only if enough of their proponents can be persuaded that they are unjust and cannot be morally justified.\u201d).[\/footnote] And that outrage is not going to be prompted by studies finding that the programs are success\u00adful\u2014if anything, such studies would be rejected as political.[footnote]See supra notes 161\u2013170 and accompanying text for discussion of responses to conflicting studies connected to ideological disagreement.[\/footnote] Appeals to values seem most likely to be successful to change the proposed policy.[footnote]See, e.g., Letter from David N. Cicilline &amp; Lou Barletta, Members of Cong., to Mick Mulvaney, Dir., Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget (Mar. 15, 2017), http:\/\/barletta.house.gov\/sites\/\r\nbarletta.house.gov\/files\/documents\/21st%20Century%20CLC%20OMB%20Letter.pdf [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/8UM7-FWBP] (asking President Trump to reinstate funding for after\u00adschool pro\u00adgrams based on appeals to values such as preventing turmoil for working families, promoting safety for kids, and allowing working parents to maintain jobs).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is also dangerous to frame policies that are really rooted in values as instead based on evidence because policies can take on a life of their own, sometimes ending up disconnected from, or even in opposition to, the values that originally prompted the policy.[footnote]Cf. Klingele, supra note 185, at 540\u201341 (\u201cAlthough most proponents of evidence-based correctional practices frame them as rehabilitative tools designed to reduce the use of incarceration and make correctional interventions more modest and humane, these tools are capable of doing the very opposite.\u201d).[\/footnote] Consider the rise of single-sex education over the last two decades. Early proponents included feminists who suggested that single-sex education could increase women\u2019s achievement.[footnote]See Rosemary Salomone, Rights and Wrongs in the Debate over Single-Sex Schooling, 93 B.U. L. Rev. 971, 976\u201377, 1027 (2013) (noting publications in the 1980s and 1990s that \u201creaffirmed the idea that American schools, overwhelmingly coed, were \u2018shortchanging\u2019 girls\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet they were soon joined by advocates peddling studies purporting to show differences in the way girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 brains learn; this development soon prompted schools to create single-sex classrooms to teach boys \u201cheroic behavior\u201d and allow them to run around while teach\u00ading girls \u201cgood character\u201d and encouraging them to sit while discussing their feelings.[footnote]See id. at 980\u201383.[\/footnote] Such policies entrench the very sex stereotypes that many of the original proponents of single-sex education intended to demolish.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when evidence is used ostensibly to justify a policy that ac\u00adtually stems from values, opponents of those values can use counterevi\u00addence to undercut the policy. For example, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education<\/em>, the Supreme Court famously (and controversially) relied in part on a study showing that black children preferred pink dolls to brown dolls to justify its ruling that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]347 U.S. 483, 494 &amp; n.11 (1954) (citing social science research to justify the prop\u00adosition that segregation \u201cwith the sanction of law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has a tendency to [retard] the educa\u00adtional and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the ben\u00adefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).[\/footnote] Segre\u00adgationists later used that same study to argue in favor of segregation, since the study showed that black children in segregated schools actually \u201cex\u00adhibited less negative reactions to the brown doll and showed less desire to play with the pink doll.\u201d[footnote]Joshua Dunn &amp; Martin West, Calculated Justice: Education Research and the Courts, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 155, 162\u201363.[\/footnote] So did the evidence show that it was better to maintain segregated schools? When values are in play, neither side is likely to convince the other side with a neutral appeal to evidence.[footnote]See, e.g., Lindblom &amp; Cohen, supra note 24, at 52 (connecting the perceived \u201cau\u00adthoritativeness\u201d of social science research for its users with the extent to which the research \u201csquares with their ideology or conforms to their general world view or epistemological position\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a debate among education scholars and practi\u00adtioners about what school reform should properly focus on: fixing the system as it exists, or reimagining the system entirely.[footnote]See, e.g., David Tyack &amp; Larry Cuban, Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform 1 (1995) (describing the tension in Americans\u2019 attitude toward school reform as one between \u201cutopian thinking\u201d and \u201ctinkering,\u201d each with both positive and neg\u00adative connotations).[\/footnote] Evidence is more likely to play a helpful role in the former than the latter.[footnote]See Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201cEvidence-based arguments about \u2018fine-tuning\u2019, based on careful research about effectiveness, might be more likely to gain traction in those areas that are away from the political heat.\u201d).[\/footnote] And tinkering can be valuable.[footnote]See, e.g., Tyack &amp; Cuban, supra note 243, at 10 (discussing \u201ca positive kind of tinkering, adapting knowledgeably to local needs and circumstances, preserving what is valuable and correcting what is not\u201d); cf.

Of course we should spend our limited public dollars on what works, and we should not spend our limited public dollars on what does not. The complexities outlined above do not indicate that we should disregard evidence or give up in despair on the research endeavor, believing that data exist only in the eye of the beholder or that we are each entitled to our own facts.[footnote]Cf. Majone, supra note 227, at 10\u201311 (\u201cEvidence is not synonymous with data or information\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

We must understand that the answer to the question of \u201cwhat works\u201d will al\u00adways be more complicated than a sound bite; research brooks no easy an\u00adswers, and implementation is messy. We must also understand that asking \u201cwhat works\u201d is itself a value-laden question. What works for what? For whom? To what end?[footnote]See Greenhalgh &amp; Russell, supra note 222, at 315 (\u201c[R]esearch evidence can and should inform policy judgments\u2014but this evidence does not in and of itself provide the answer to the ethical question of \u2018what to do\u2019 (and in particular, \u2018how to allocate resources\u2019).\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 253\u201354 (\u201cResearch has a vital role to play in demo\u00adcratic policy debate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to dictate outcomes or to presume that public officials should be the handmaidens of researchers, but to ensure that public decisionmaking is informed by all the facts, insights, and analyses that the tools of science can provide.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe authors of the important 2002 National Research Council report on scientific research in education referenced above argued that the \u201ccompelling culture of democratic accountability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. demands evidence that public monies are wisely spent.\u201d[footnote]See Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 5; see also supra text accompanying note 169.[\/footnote] This is true. But the compelling culture of democratic accountability also demands vigorous debate about the underlying goals to which public monies are put. We ought to high\u00adlight this debate whenever calls for evidence-based policymaking imply that technocratic, value-free solutions are only a research study away.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the invocations of evidence in ESSA. It is good to encourage decisionmakers to canvas their needs and examine what research might help them meet those needs. But evidence require\u00adments do not provide a meaningful way to constrain decisionmaking in education, nor are they likely to provide the answers that will fix the sys\u00adtem once and for all. We should not let a focus on evidence distract us from the democratic debate at the core of education. In conversations about the right path forward for education policy\u2014and other policies that form the fabric of our democracy\u2014we ignore discussions of values at our peril.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It is also not likely that these requirements will themselves result in significant im\u00adprovements to education in America or resolve raging debates about the best way to engage in school reform.\r\n\r\nWhy not? First, as Part I illustrates, although ESSA\u2019s references to evi\u00addence-based decisionmaking are numerous, its actual requirements for evidence-based decisionmaking are anything but stringent.[footnote]See infra section I.A. [\/footnote] The Depart\u00adment of Education, states, and school districts retain many opportunities to push their preferred policy choices.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Part II lays out, requirements to identify \u201cwhat works\u201d overestimate the current knowledge base and potential for future research, and they underestimate the challenges of implementation in the messy, human endeavor of teaching and learning that goes on every day in thousands of jurisdictions all over America. While the analysis in this Part focuses on education research, the critiques apply more broadly to social science research in general.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Part III explains, the elusive search for \u201cwhat works\u201d can obscure critical and often contested values-based decisions about what we should be trying to do in the first place and about necessary tradeoffs along the way. This Part, too, focuses on education policy, but the argument extends broadly to other kinds of social policy.\r\n\r\nThis Essay should not be read as a critique of the evidence require\u00adments in ESSA but rather as a caution against the fetishization of evi\u00addence in social science policymaking more generally. Too often, policy\u00admakers envision what evaluation scholars call an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d for evidence, in which research will provide an uncontested answer to a clear policy problem.[footnote]Cynthia E. Coburn, Meredith I. Honig &amp; Mary Kay Stein, What\u2019s the Evidence on Districts\u2019 Use of Evidence?, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement 67, 75 (John D. Bransford, Deborah J. Stipek, Nancy J. Vye, Louis M. Gomez &amp; Diana Lam eds., 2009).[\/footnote] But research findings almost never provide a straight\u00adforward answer about what to do,[footnote]See infra notes 141\u2013186 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] and decisions about education and other social policies are enmeshed in a complex web of political realities, institutional capacities, and societal values.[footnote]See infra notes 222\u2013249 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Too often, then, decision\u00admakers on the ground end up using evidence in what evaluation scholars call a \u201csymbolic\u201d way, \u201ccreat[ing] legitimacy for solutions that are already favored or even enacted,\u201d thereby largely undermining the point of requiring evidence-based decisions in the first place.[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 77.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nInstead, evidence plays the most valuable role as what evaluation scholars call a \u201cconceptual\u201d tool.[footnote]See id. at 76\u201377.[\/footnote] In the words of Carol Weiss, a pioneer\u00ading scholar in the evaluation of social policy:\r\n<blockquote>Social research can be \u201cused\u201d in reconceptualizing the charac\u00adter of policy issues or even redefining the policy agenda. Thus, social research may sensitize decisionmakers to new issues and turn what were nonproblems into policy problems\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In turn, it may convert existing social problems into nonproblems\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

But it should be viewed as only one component of the democratic deliberation and political con\u00adtestation in which education, like other social policies, is rooted.\r\n\r\nThe focus on evidence-based policymaking in education has some valuable aspects, then, but it should not be seen as a panacea or as a neutral, technocratic solution.

The Limits of the Law<\/h2>\r\nNotwithstanding the frequency of their appearance, the evidence re\u00adquirements in ESSA are limited.[footnote]See infra section I.A.[\/footnote] The Department of Education, states, and local school districts have many opportunities to promote whatever policies they would like to promote for whatever reason.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>A. ESSA\u2019s Instructions for the Use of Evidence<\/h3>\r\nESSA refers to evidence numerous times throughout its thousand pages. Depending on how one counts such a reference, there may be as many as fifty-eight such instances.[footnote]Memorandum from the Penn Hill Grp. on Evidence-Based and Its Use in ESSA to the Council of Chief State Sch.

As this section ex\u00adplains, the references to evidence are (1) not directed at the federal gov\u00adernment; (2) include only limited requirements for states, school dis\u00adtricts, and schools; (3) provide a generous definition of what counts as \u201cevidence\u201d; and (4) are in most cases merely suggestions.\r\n\r\n1.<em> Not Directed at the Federal Government.<\/em> \u2014 It is important first to distinguish among the entities that might be subject to ESSA\u2019s evidence instructions: the federal executive branch, state education author\u00adities, and local school districts and schools.\r\n\r\nUnlike in many other regulatory programs, with broad delegations to federal agencies to regulate a policy area \u201cin the public interest\u201d or in a manner that is \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d congressional delegations to the Department of Education largely authorize the agency to award grants to states and districts under terms that are intricately detailed by statute.[footnote]See Derek W.

For example, the Secretary may not reject a state\u2019s funding application for any substantive reason; the Secretary is limited to asking for compliance with the technical requirements laid out by stat\u00adute.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07871(c) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] The Secretary may not require states or school districts seeking a waiver under any part of the Act to commit to taking any particular steps in order to receive the waiver.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07861(b)(4), (d)(3).[\/footnote] And the Secretary is prevented from prom\u00adulgating expansive rules or issuing detailed nonregulatory guidance on particular components of state compliance with the Act.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06311(e), 7915.[\/footnote] This aspect of ESSA grows out of congressional charges, especially from Republicans, that President Obama\u2019s Department of Education aggrandized both the federal role in general and the executive branch\u2019s authority in particular.[footnote]See, e.g., Patrick McGuinn, From No Child Left Behind to the Every Student Suc\u00adceeds Act: Federalism and the Education Legacy of the Obama Administration, 46 Publius: J.

ESSA contains other, smaller formula grants, as well as a wide variety of competitive grants, but as section I.A.4 explains below, the focus on evidence in these grants is permissive rather than mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for evidence-based practices appear in only two places in Title I: in the development of school districts\u2019 plans to engage parents and families,[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(b)(7), 6318(a)(2)(E) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] and in the development of school \u201csupport and improvement plan[s]\u201d for a small group of schools that are not adequately meeting the state\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] Neither of these require\u00adments is broadly systemic.\r\n\r\nThe first of these activities\u2014designing parent engagement plans\u2014is not a central part of the Act; it is merely one of twenty-odd things a local school district must include in its application to receive a subgrant under ESSA from the state.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a), (b)(7).[\/footnote] There is no real consequence for failure to do any of the things the school districts say they will do in asking for their sub\u00adgrant.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06312(a)(5), 6318(h) (providing for local review but not state conse\u00adquences); see also Pasachoff, Agency Enforcement, supra note 37, at 284 (describing infre\u00adquency of funding cut-offs for a grantee\u2019s noncompliance with terms of a grant).[\/footnote] The requirement for the parent engagement plan to explain how the school district will conduct a needs assessment and then use the findings \u201cto design evidence-based strategies for more effective parental involve\u00adment\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(D)\u2013(E).[\/footnote] thus cannot be seen as transformative or constraining in any way.\r\n\r\nThe second of these activities\u2014designing school improvement plans\u2014is a much bigger deal, as these plans are core to the accountability re\u00adgime that lies at the center of the Act.[footnote]See, e.g., Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 115\u201317, 124\u201326) (contrasting NCLB and ESSA accountability regimes as the central parts of each Act).[\/footnote] Here, too, however, the calls for evidence-based interventions are not that significant.\r\n\r\nThere are two situations in which school improvement plans are re\u00adquired. The first situation is narrower, based on low achievement of one or more \u201csubgroups\u201d in a school.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2).[\/footnote] \u201cSubgroup of students\u201d is a term of art in the statute, as it was in No Child Left Behind,[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) (2002).[\/footnote] meaning \u201ceconomi\u00adcally disadvantaged students,\u201d \u201cstudents from major racial and ethnic groups,\u201d \u201cchildren with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cEnglish learners.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(2) (Supp. 2015).[\/footnote] For all schools in which one or more of these subgroups \u201care consistently underper\u00adforming\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A)(ii).[\/footnote] under the state\u2019s accountability requirements\u2014test scores, graduation rates for high schools, progress in achieving English profi\u00adciency, and any \u201cother indicator of school quality or student success\u201d that the state wishes to adopt[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(B)\u2013(C).[\/footnote]\u2014the state educational agency must inform the local school district of these schools\u2019 existence and must ensure that the school district in turn notifies the schools.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(A).[\/footnote] Each school must then work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a \u201ctargeted support and im\u00adprovement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to remedy the problem for the relevant subgroup(s).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(2)(B).[\/footnote] This targeted plan must then be approved and subsequently monitored by the school district.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second situation that requires a school improvement plan is broader, based on the performance of the school as a whole.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1).[\/footnote] For at least those schools that perform the worst in the state on tests or on high school graduation rates, as well as for those schools in which a subgroup\u2019s performance on its own would rank at the bottom of the state\u2019s perform\u00adance requirements,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(c)(4)(D)(i).[\/footnote] the state educational agency must again identify these schools to their school district.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Now, instead of simply notifying the schools that they must implement an improvement plan, the school dis\u00adtrict itself has to work with community \u201cstakeholders\u201d to develop a school-level \u201ccomprehensive support and improvement plan\u201d that \u201cincludes evidence-based interventions\u201d to fix the school\u2019s achievement problems.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B).[\/footnote] This comprehensive plan must be approved not only by the individual school and school district but also by the state educational agency,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(v).[\/footnote] which must also then monitor its implementation.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(1)(B)(vi).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese provisions constitute the sum total of the evidence requirements in the Act. Note the limited categories of schools and stu\u00addents to which the more significant requirements\u2014those for school im\u00adprovement plans\u2014apply. The requirements apply only to decisions about how to respond to the persistently low performance of certain subsets of children and ex\u00adtremely small percentages of schools. While this is an im\u00adportant category of children and schools, these requirements are simply not going to significantly transform or constrain the education decisions of states, dis\u00adtricts, and schools as a whole.[footnote]Cf. Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 125\u201326) (criticizing ESSA\u2019s accountability regime for applying to \u201calmost no one,\u201d and describing requirements for evidence-based interventions as positive but nonetheless \u201crelatively mi\u00adnor\u201d in light of the vast flexibility otherwise granted to states).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Generous Definitions of Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 To be sure, these requirements could, in principle, play a dramatic role for the neediest children and schools if the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d itself imposed meaningful constraints on decisionmaking. That is, if \u201cevidence-based\u201d closed off a significant universe of options, then it could indeed be constraining. But it does not.\r\n\r\nThe statute devotes several paragraphs to a definition of the term \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)\u2013(B).[\/footnote] ESSA presents four possible ways, with different de\u00adgrees of strenuousness, by which an entity may show that \u201can activity, strategy, or intervention\u201d is \u201cevidence-based.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe three most demanding ways require a grantee to \u201cdemonstrate[] a statistically significant effect on improving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes,\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i).[\/footnote] with different tiers of evidence required to make that showing: There must be either (1) \u201cstrong evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented experimental study\u201d; (2) \u201cmoderate evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented quasi-exper\u00adimental study\u201d; or (3) \u201cpromising evidence from at least 1 well-designed and well-implemented correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III).[\/footnote] These are the tiers of evidence that must apply to the school improvement plans and related state activities for the lowest-achieving schools and student subgroups.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth, less demanding tier of evidence. To be evidence based under this tier, an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention\u201d need not be statistically significant, but must merely \u201cdemonstrate[] a rationale based on high-quality research findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(I).[\/footnote] Such an \u201cactivity, strategy, or intervention,\u201d if se\u00adlected by an educational authority, must also \u201cinclude[] ongoing efforts to examine the effects of such activity, strategy, or intervention.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(ii)(II).[\/footnote] This fourth tier is applicable to the requirement for evidence in developing parent and family engagement plans; such plans may be based on evi\u00addence in one of the top three tiers, but need not be, as long as they are based on evidence that would satisfy this fourth tier.[footnote]Compare id. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(B) (defining \u201cevidence-based\u201d activities as only those that satisfy one of the top three tiers of evidence), with id. \u00a7\u00a06318(a)(2)(E) (imposing no such limitation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs Part II below will make clear, it is not difficult to find evidence to support a vast range of educational interventions under these definitions, even under the top three tiers that are applicable to school improvement plans. Tier three (\u201cpromising evidence\u201d) and tier four (a \u201crationale\u201d with a promise to assess it as implemented) are especially easy to meet. To be sure, the commitment that grantees make under tier four to engage in ongoing assessment of their activities could encourage them to make better decisions\u2014but the reality is that only those grantees who already want to engage in the process of continuous improvement are likely to take this opportunity seriously.[footnote]See West, supra note 31 (noting \u201c[t]hose six words [\u201c\u2018ongoing efforts to examine the effects\u2019 of the activity on important student outcomes\u201d], if taken seriously and imple\u00admented with care, hold the potential to create and provide resources to sustain a new model for decision-making within state agencies and school districts,\u201d but \u201c[t]he oppor\u00adtunity to use federal funds for evaluation purposes will only make a difference if state offi\u00adcials choose to exploit it.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to the extent ESSA\u2019s evidence requirements include con\u00adstraints, the constraints are not on determining what state, district, and school educational goals should be, but only on how to achieve those goals. Because ESSA as a whole is shot through with providing substan\u00adtive discretion to states, districts, and schools,[footnote]Black, Abandoning the Federal Role, supra note 13 (manuscript at 127\u201329).[\/footnote] the statute\u2019s evidence def\u00adinitions do little to limit policy choices.\r\n\r\n4. <em>Other, Broadly Permissive References to Evidence.<\/em> \u2014 Beyond the par\u00adent engagement plans and the school improvement plans in Title I, the other references to evidence in ESSA are all permissive rather than man\u00addatory. This permissiveness will not fundamentally transform practices or cabin discretion.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the references to evidence in three smaller formula grants: one to support at-risk youth;[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06431\u20136439 (Title I, Part D, Subpart 1).[\/footnote] one to support teachers and principals;[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06611\u20136614 (Title II, Part A).[\/footnote] and one for \u201cstudent support and academic enrich\u00adment.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07111\u20137122 (Title IV, Part A, Subpart 1).[\/footnote] States need not apply for these grants at all, but if they do, and if they want to engage in certain activities identified in the statute, they must simply agree to find evidence-based ways to do so.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06434(c)(20)(B) (providing that services and interventions for youth who have been in contact with both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems should be evi\u00addence based); id. \u00a7\u00a06611(c)(4)(B)(v)(I), (vii)(III) (permitting states to use funds under the teacher and principal grant to allow \u201ceffective teachers to lead evidence-based\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. pro\u00adfes\u00adsional development\u201d for their peers and to develop \u201cinduction and mentoring pro\u00adgrams\u201d for new teachers and principals that are evidence based); id. \u00a7\u00a06613(b)(3)(D), (E) (pro\u00adviding that school districts may use funds under the teacher and principal grant to \u201creduc[e] class size to a level that is evidence-based\u201d and to provide \u201chigh-quality, person\u00adalized pro\u00adfessional development that is evidence-based\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07114(b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (B)(iii), (C)(iii) (permitting states to use funds under the student support and academic enrich\u00adment grant to help school districts implement \u201cmental health awareness training programs,\u201d integrate \u201chealth and safety practices into school or athletic pro\u00adgrams,\u201d and deliver \u201cspe\u00adcialized or rigorous academic courses and cur\u00adricula through the use of technology\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07118(5)(A), (B)(ii)(II)(aa), (F)(ii) (providing that school districts may use their funds on evidence-based programs in \u201cdrug and violence preven\u00adtion activities,\u201d \u201cschool-based mental health services,\u201d and in \u201creduc[ing] exclusionary disci\u00adpline practices\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese provisions may do some work to promote evidence-based thinking, especially when the items on the list are popular interventions like class size reductions.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06613(b)(3)(D); see also Dan D. Goldhaber &amp; Dominic J. Brewer, What Gets Studied and Why: Examining the Incentives that Drive Education Research, <em>in<\/em> When Re\u00adsearch Matters, supra note 14, at 197, 197 (discussing the popularity of this policy).[\/footnote] But the reach of the work should not be over\u00adstated. The statute includes the caveat that evidence need be used only \u201cto the extent the State determines that such evidence is reasonably avail\u00adable.\u201d[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06434(c)(20)(B); id. \u00a7\u00a06611(c)(4)(B)(v)(I), (vii)(III), (xxi); id. \u00a7\u00a06613(b)(3)(D), (P); id. \u00a7\u00a07114(b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (iii), (C)(iii).[\/footnote] The statute also identifies many other potential activities for which these funds may be used without requiring that states tie those activities to evidence at all.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06434(c) (listing twenty aspects of a plan a state must describe if it wants cer\u00adtain funds for \u201cneglected, delinquent, and at-risk children and youth,\u201d only one of which mentions the use of evidence); id. \u00a7\u00a06611(c)(4)(B) (listing twenty-one allowable uses of funds for state activities under the teacher and principal grant, only three of which men\u00adtion the use of evidence); id. \u00a7\u00a06613(b)(3) (listing sixteen allowable uses of funds for school districts receiving subgrants under this grant, only four of which mention the use of evi\u00addence); id. \u00a7\u00a07114(b) (listing seventeen allowable uses of funds for state activities under the student support and academic enrichment grant, only three of which mention the use of evidence); id. \u00a7\u00a07118 (listing twenty-eight allowable uses of funds under this grant, only three of which mention the use of evidence).[\/footnote] And given the minimal requirements in the statutory definition of \u201cevidence-based\u201d itself,[footnote]See supra notes 63\u201370 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] all of these references to evidence could be satisfied with not much more than an articulated ra\u00adtionale based on some research found somewhere. These provisions may refer to evidence, then, but they are hardly constraining.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of references to evidence in ESSA\u2019s competitive grants. While certain competitive grants encourage applicants to embed evidence-based activities in their programs, the encouragement is not particularly strenuous. For example, some grants provide \u201cpriority points\u201d for applicants who can demonstrate that their proposed activities are sup\u00adported by evidence from the top three tiers, but they do not require ap\u00adplicants to make such a demonstration.[footnote]20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06642(e) (grants for \u201c[c]omprehensive literacy State development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06672(e) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(e) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07243(c) (grants for \u201cstate\u00adwide family engagement centers\u201d); id \u00a7\u00a07274(b) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(b) (grants for \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(f) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-ability learners and learning\u201d); see also id. \u00a7\u00a07231e(2)(A) (listing evi\u00addence-based projects as one of several ways applicants for grants to support magnet schools may establish priority).[\/footnote] Some further limit a portion (but not all) of any federal funds awarded to those activities that are gen\u00aderally \u201cevidence-based\u201d (including the bottom tier of evidence).[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a06672(a)(2), (5) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a06673(a)(6) (grants for \u201c[s]chool leader recruitment and support\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07242,\u00a07243(b)(6)(G) (grants for \u201cstatewide family engagement centers\u201d).[\/footnote] Some also require ongoing evaluation of the extent to which the grant pro\u00adgrams are successful.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07274(h), (i) (grants for \u201c[p]romise neighborhoods\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07275(f), (g) (grants for \u201c[f]ull-service community schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07294(h) (grants for \u201c[s]upporting high-abil\u00adity learners and learning\u201d).[\/footnote] One is designed to encourage broad efforts to \u201ccreate, develop, implement, replicate, or take to scale entrepreneurial, evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement and attain\u00adment for high-need students.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07261(a)(1)(A) (grants for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo embed incentives for evidence across numerous multimillion dollar grants is not nothing.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06603(b) (authorizing close to $500 million each year for a variety of competitive grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07246 (authorizing $10 million each year for another competi\u00adtive grant); id. \u00a7\u00a07251(a) (authorizing between $200 and $221 million each year for an\u00adother set of competitive grants).[\/footnote] But nor is it everything. There remain many competitive grants in ESSA that do not require any particular evidence-based decisionmaking to support an application.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06662 (grants for \u201cPresidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07221b(g) (grants to support \u201chigh-quality charter schools\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07281 (grants for \u201c[n]ational activities for school safety\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07292 (grants for \u201cassistance for arts education\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a07293 (grants for \u201c[r]eady to learn programming\u201d).[\/footnote] The eligible entities for some of the grants encouraging evidence-based thinking are not even state educational authorities, school districts, or schools,[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06672(f) (including institutions of higher education and nonprofits as eligible entities for \u201c[s]upporting effective educator development\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07261(b) (including nonprofits acting on their own as well as a governmental agency acting in partnership with a nonprofit, a business, \u201can educational service agency,\u201d or \u201can institu\u00adtion of higher education\u201d as eligible entities for \u201ceducation innovation and research\u201d grants); id. \u00a7\u00a07272(1) (including institutions of higher education as well as nonprofits working in partnership with certain other entities as eligible entities for \u201c[p]romise neigh\u00adborhood[]\u201d grants, and including a consortium of community-based organizations or nonprofit organizations as eligible entities for \u201cfull-service community school[]\u201d grants).[\/footnote] so the effect of these evidence requirements on the nation\u2019s core educational institutions is further diluted. And, of course, the nature of competitive grants is that not every eligible entity will apply, and certainly not every entity that ap\u00adplies will win one.\r\n\r\nThe permissive references to evidence throughout ESSA thus may do more to express a mood than to provide an actual set of transforma\u00adtive constraints.\r\n<h3>B. Opportunities to Find, Promote, and Use Evidence as Desired\u2014Or to Ignore It<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the lack of constraints imposed by ESSA\u2019s references to evidence, it is worth considering the ways in which the states and the fed\u00aderal government can continue to push their own policy prefer\u00adences within the bounds of the law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>State Choices.<\/em> \u2014 Because states are the primary recipients of fund\u00ading under ESSA\u2014most local money is allocated through subgrants[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a06312(a)(1) (authorizing subgrants to local school districts).[\/footnote]\u2014state authority to steer school districts and schools toward state priorities for education is significant.\r\n\r\nAs should be clear from the discussion of ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions above, there are major parts of the Act that simply require no evidence whatsoever.

It might suggest that some aspects of education are too compli\u00adcated to demand evidence for; that in some categories of action, federal\u00adism trumps evidence; or simply that political dealmaking reached the median voter here. Whatever the reason, it is clear that in vast swaths of their educational undertakings, states need not examine research but may simply make policy choices.\r\n\r\nWhen states do have to use research evidence, ESSA also provides numerous opportunities for states to require districts and schools to adopt whatever evidence-based interventions the state prioritizes.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a06311(d)(3)(B)(ii).[\/footnote] This type of activity illustrates what evaluation scholars call a \u201csanctioning role\u201d for evidence, when state or federal agencies deem particular inter\u00adventions \u201c\u2018research-based\u2019 and thus approved for use with state or federal funds.\u201d[footnote]See Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 75, 78.[\/footnote] Here, too, then, states are empowered to select the evidence they find most persuasive to support the interventions they want to sup\u00adport anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother way states can specify the evidence-based interventions they prefer is designing criteria for ESSA\u2019s school improvement subgrants to local educational agencies.[footnote]See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06303(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] Controlling the purse strings provides au\u00adthority to make policy choices without much constraint from the require\u00adment for evidence.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Federal Choices.<\/em> \u2014 There are numerous ways in which the Trump Administration can implement ESSA\u2019s evidence provisions while still push\u00ading its own agenda, whether through regulation, nonregulatory guid\u00adance, grant competitions, or the budget process.\r\n\r\nConsider first the role of regulation. Shortly before leaving office, the Obama Administration promulgated a final rule to implement the Act\u2019s accountability requirements.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

See, e.g., Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 78 (describing a study in which several districts chose programs from a list without \u201cparticularly support[ing] [those programs] solely as a way to maintain their federal funding\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother way an administration can use the regulatory process to put its stamp on evidence is to clarify the definition of that term. For example, in 2013, as part of the Obama Administration\u2019s effort to pro\u00admote evidence-based policymaking more generally,[footnote]See supra note 6 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the Department of Education revised its General Administrative Regulations to include for the first time a detailed definition of evidence that it could use in the competitive grant application process.[footnote]Compare Direct Grant Programs and Definitions that Apply to Department Regu\u00adlations, 78 Fed.

For example, in 2016, the Obama accountability rules placed an additional limit on how to estab\u00adlish that interventions in school improvement plans under ESSA would be evidence based: It would not be acceptable to pick an intervention that is justified only by a lower tier of evidence if an intervention justified by a higher tier of evidence would also be appropriate.[footnote]Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Stu\u00addent Succeeds Act\u2014Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

This ab\u00adsence further opens the door for the Trump Administration to push its own policy choices more generally, even if supported by weaker evidence.\r\n\r\nNonregulatory guidance provides one opportunity to do so. Several months before the Obama Administration issued the accountability regu\u00adlations in November 2016, it issued nonregulatory guidance on using evi\u00addence.[footnote]U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Educa\u00adtion Investments (2016) [hereinafter U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Using Evidence], http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/\r\npolicy\/elsec\/leg\/essa\/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/A2T5-8GL5].[\/footnote] That guidance contained detailed recommendations for how states, districts, and schools should identify evidence at each of ESSA\u2019s four tiers.[footnote]Id. at 8\u20139.[\/footnote] Most importantly, the guidance explains that, while the stat\u00adutory definition of evidence-based requires only \u201cat least one study,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted) (paraphrasing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07801(21)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2015)).[\/footnote] stakeholders in fact \u201cshould consider the entire body of relevant evi\u00addence\u201d and should not choose interventions that only one study supports if there are other equally strong studies that reach the opposite conclusion about the intervention.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs of October 2017, that guidance document is still on the Trump Department of Education\u2019s website,[footnote]See U.S. Dep\u2019t Educ., Using Evidence, supra note 113 (providing a permalink that captured the document as of October 20, 2017).[\/footnote] but rescinding that guidance docu\u00adment would be one way for the Trump Administration to put its mark on the interventions it wants states, districts, and schools to select.

The Trump Administration appears to be using grant awards to reject at least some evidence-based programs in the social policy space.

Each year, the President\u2019s budget will propose funding different programs and activities at different amounts, and different Pres\u00adidents prioritize different things.[footnote]See, e.g., Allen Schick, The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy, Process 101 (3d ed. 2007); Pasachoff, The President\u2019s Budget, supra note 29, at 2211\u201312.[\/footnote] Congress, too, can decide whether and to what extent to fund the President\u2019s priorities.[footnote]Schick, supra note 128, at 109.[\/footnote] A program that embeds evidence-based thinking may simply not be prioritized. At the same time, Congress can make clear, whether through formal appropria\u00adtions riders[footnote]Jason A. MacDonald, Limitation Riders and Congressional Influence over Bu\u00adreau\u00adcratic Policy Decisions, 104 Am. Pol. Sci.

The Limits of the Research<\/h2>\r\nEven if ESSA\u2019s language were tightened, however, challenges would remain, for no provision requiring evidence-based decisionmaking is likely to dramatically improve education in America. The hope that evidence will drive such a transformation stems from \u201cassum[ptions] that evidence is clear, unambiguous, and available; that decision makers use evidence in an instrumental fashion, weighing the merits of alternate courses of action and choosing the solutions that best fit the problem; and there\u00adfore that evidence leads directly to decisions.\u201d[footnote]Coburn et al., supra note 19, at 69.[\/footnote] As this Part demonstrates, however, these assumptions turn out to be wrong, in light of limits in the state of the research, difficulties in conducting this kind of social science research in the first place, and challenges in implementing what research findings exist.\r\n<h3>A. The Small and Contested Research Base<\/h3>\r\nAs two leading education funders and former federal officials wrote almost a decade into the No Child Left Behind era, \u201c[G]iven the amount of paper and breath expended on the various pedagogical \u2018wars,\u2019 one might think that by now there would be more definitive knowledge and agree\u00adment on what to do.\u201d[footnote]Frederic A.

Smith<em>, <\/em>The Role of Research in Education Re\u00adform from the Perspective of Federal Policymakers and Foundation Grantmakers, <em>in<\/em> The Role of Research in Educational Improvement, supra note 19, at 19, 32.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat having been said, there is no doubt that the quality and quan\u00adtity of research in education have exploded over the course of the last two decades. In large part, this development was prompted by incentives in federal law. Reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00adcation Act (ESEA) of 1965 and additional stand-alone legislation dating back to 1988 started to encourage a focus on finding and implementing effective programs.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin Michael Superfine, New Directions in School Funding and Governance: Moving from Politics to Evidence, 98 Ky. L.J. 653, 678\u201380 (2010) (describing this history); see also Michael J. Feuer, Lisa Towne &amp; Richard J. Shavelson, Scientific Culture and Educational Research, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 4, 4\u20136 (comparing this history to other fields).[\/footnote] This focus reached a high point in 2002, when Congress reauthorized the ESEA as NCLB, which required numerous in\u00adterventions relying on \u201cscientifically based research,\u201d[footnote]The term \u201cscientifically based research\u201d appeared 111 times in NCLB. See Kamina Aliya Pinder, Using Federal Law to Prescribe Pedagogy: Lessons Learned from the Scien\u00adtifically-Based Research Requirements of No Child Left Behind, 6 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 47, 59 (2008). NCLB\u2019s definition of \u201cscientific research\u201d was controversial, as it seemed to limit acceptable forms of research to randomized control trials. See, e.g., David C. Berliner, Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All, Educ. Researcher, Nov. 2002, at 18, 18 (critiquing NCLB\u2019s definition). ESSA\u2019s expansion of the phrase \u201cevidence-based\u201d to in\u00adclude four tiers of research instead of just the top tier is in part a response to these cri\u00adtiques. See West, supra note 31 (explaining the difference between ESSA\u2019s evidence re\u00adquirements and NCLB\u2019s \u201cscientifically based research\u201d).[\/footnote] and then subse\u00adquently passed the Education Sciences Reform Act, which expanded and institutionalized the federal infrastructure for funding and encouraging education research.[footnote]See Superfine, supra note 134, at 692 (calling the Education Sciences Reform Act \u201ca reasoned response to the inconsistent quality of educational research and the lack of a solid evidentiary base for making effective educational funding decisions,\u201d while also not\u00ading its \u201cfail[ure] to account for the complex and heavily contextualized nature of educa\u00adtion\u201d).

Head, Reconsidering Evidence-Based Policy: Key Issues and Challenges, 29 Pol\u2019y &amp; Soc\u2019y 77, 77, 81 (2010). The metaphor of research being used as a partisan weapon is common. See, e.g., Pamela Barnhouse Walters &amp; Annette Lareau, Education Research that Matters: Influence, Scientific Rigor, and Policymaking, <em>in<\/em> Education Re\u00adsearch on Trial, supra note 2, at 197, 214 (noting that research is used more as an \u201carse\u00adnal\u201d by those with policy goals already in place); Kenneth K.

After con\u00adsidering the appropriate extent of \u201c[p]olitical insulation\u201d of any federal educational research agency, the authors concluded that \u201c[i]t would be simply incompatible with the American tradition of democratic govern\u00adance to exclude political and social influences from decisions about re\u00adsearch priorities.\u201d[footnote]Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 10.[\/footnote] There is a real logic to this argument.[footnote]Cf. Pasachoff, The President\u2019s Budget, supra note 29, at 2269\u201370 (noting that funding decisions are \u201cvalue-laden decisions\u201d that have a proper place in government priority setting).[\/footnote] But it also comes with a cost. When the government promotes evidence-based deci\u00adsionmaking but does not seem neutral in so doing, it can be hard to see evidence itself as anything other than political.\r\n<h3>B. The Complexities of Education Research<\/h3>\r\nAnother set of issues further limits the likelihood that evidence-based policymaking will ultimately transform education in America: the com\u00adplexities inherent in conducting this kind of social science research.\r\n\r\nIn a twist on the familiar contrast between the hard sciences (\u201c[p]hys\u00adics, chemistry, geology, and so on\u201d) and the soft sciences (\u201cthe social sciences in general and education in particular\u201d), one education scholar instead contrasts the \u201c[h]ard-to-do science[s]\u201d (like social science in gen\u00aderal and education in particular) and the \u201c[e]asy-to-do science[s]\u201d (like physics, chemistry, and the rest).[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 18.[\/footnote] \u201cWe do our science under conditions that physical scientists find intolerable,\u201d wrote this education scholar, referring to messy, human, context-bound interactions.[footnote]Id.; see also Levin, supra note 140, at 4 (\u201c[K]nowledge about human behavior is in principle different from knowledge of the inanimate world\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Of course, even knowledge about the inanimate world has research challenges. See, e.g., Wendy E. Wagner, The Science Charade in Toxic Risk Regulation, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1613, 1619\u201322 (1995) (discussing \u201ctrans-science\u201d questions that can be hidden, intentionally or unintentionally, during the research process). These same challenges exist in education research. See, e.g., Simpson, supra note 158, at 463 (noting researchers\u2019 ability to \u201clegitimately directly ma\u00adnipulate effect size when they are looking to increase their chance of detecting a difference\u201d).[\/footnote] Or, as another tongue-in-cheek reflection on these challenges suggests, all social science knowledge can be generally summarized as follows: \u201c(1) Some do, some don\u2019t. (2) The differences aren\u2019t very great. (3) It\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d[footnote]Edward R. Tufte, Beautiful Evidence 138 (2006).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne challenge to education research is that it involves \u201ccomplex so\u00adcial systems such as classrooms and schools\u201d[footnote]Ginsburg &amp; Smith, supra note 140, at 6.[\/footnote] with \u201chumans\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. embed\u00added in complex and changing networks of social interaction.\u201d[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 7 (dis\u00adcussing features of education that complicate its study, including the volition and diversity of people and the variability of curriculum, instruction, and governance); Superfine, supra note 134, at 690\u201392 (discussing the \u201ccomplex and heavily contextualized nature of education\u201d).[\/footnote] Studies of interventions that seem to work in one con\u00adtext can be hard to repli\u00adcate in a wildly different context, given the number of often indetermin\u00adable and likely unmeasurable variables potentially at issue.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19 (describing \u201cthe ordinary events of life,\u201d from \u201ca sick child, a messy divorce, [or] a passionate love affair\u201d to \u201ca new principal, a new child in the classroom, [or] rain that keeps the children from a recess outside the school building,\u201d that \u201climit[] the generalizability of educational research findings\u201d); see also Ginsburg &amp; Smith, supra note 140, at 1 (noting that even randomized controlled trials with internal validity do not necessarily have external validity); Lawrence W.

Almost 14,000 school districts have different needs, populations, curricula, instructional practices, and governance structures.[footnote]Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Educ. Statistics, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., Digest of Education Statistics: Table 214.10.

For example:\r\n<blockquote>Any teaching behavior interacts with a number of student char\u00adacteristics, including IQ, socioeconomic status, motivation to learn, and a host of other factors. Simultaneously, student be\u00adhavior is interacting with teacher characteristics, such as the teacher\u2019s training in the subject taught, conceptions of learning, beliefs about assessment, and even the teacher\u2019s personal happi\u00adness with life. But it doesn\u2019t end there because other variables interact with those just mentioned\u2014the curriculum materials, the socioeconomic status of the community, peer effects in the school, youth employment in the area, and so forth. Moreover, we are not even sure in which directions the influences work, and many surely are reciprocal.[footnote]Berliner, supra note 135, at 19; see also Cohen et al., supra note 25, at 86\u201387 (dis\u00adcussing the difficulties of \u201cobservation and measurement of complex social and intellectu\u00adal processes\u201d involved in teaching).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIt is therefore difficult to isolate connections that might matter to a study\u2019s conclusions.\r\n\r\nA further challenge with conducting education research emerges from the difficulty of getting education decisionmakers to keep an intervention in place long enough to assess its value (even given the difficulties with assessment just discussed).

Once we bring that question to the fore, it becomes clear that debates about evidence can sometimes be a cover for an underlying substantive disagreement about goals. Framing decisions as evidence based presents a danger that values-based decisions will be masked as neutral.[footnote]See Maris A. Vinovskis, Missing in Practice? Development and Evaluation at the U.S. Department of Education, <em>in<\/em> Evidence Matters, supra note 25, at 120, 124\u201325 (des\u00adcribing the way that research can operate \u201cby shifting attention from moral commitment to analytical problems that rarely have clear-cut or simple solutions\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bruce K.

What if they erroneously concluded that vouchers stimulate academic achievement, and did something about this in terms of funding priorities? What if they falsely concluded that school desegregation does not affect minority achievement when it does, and acted accordingly? Incorrect causal conclusions have costs in terms of dollars, achievements, and dreams.[footnote]Cook, supra note 152, at 117.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nBut what if the choices made by \u201cpolicy elites\u201d are really about val\u00adues\u2014for example, to take the above policies, a belief that religion should play a greater role in public and private life, that \u201cgovernment schools\u201d stifle liberty,[footnote]Julie Bosman, Public Schools?

When President Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director explained the Administration\u2019s decision to elim\u00adi\u00adnate funding for afterschool programs and associated nutritional sup\u00adports by invoking a lack of evidence that these programs work to boost student achievement,[footnote]Julia Zorthian, White House: There\u2019s No Evidence After-School Programs Help Kids\u2019 Performance, Fortune (Mar. 16, 2017), http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/16\/donald-trump-after-\r\nschool-programs-performance-mick-mulvaney-budget\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/W4V2-M7GZ].[\/footnote] did he really mean that there is no evidence that they work? That he read the studies showing that they do and decided that the studies were flawed? Or was this decision part of a moral uni\u00adverse defining what role the government should play, as opposed to the family, the market, or the church, with the references to evidence merely acting as a cover?[footnote]See Gordon &amp; Haskins, supra note 223 (discussing the research on afterschool programs in light of the OMB director\u2019s statement that they do not work, and critiquing the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to cut these programs as a reflection of unacknowl\u00adedged values rather than actual reliance on evidence).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous when policy choices that are really rooted in values are framed as evidence based because debates about those policy choices end up taking place on a plane that is disconnected from reality. The Trump Administration is not going to be convinced to fund afterschool programs with a data dump of studies showing that the programs are successful. In\u00adstead, if the Administration changes its position on whether to fund a given program, it will be due to voters\u2019 moral outrage.[footnote]Cf. Michael Tonry, Making Peace, Not a Desert, 10 Criminology &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 637, 639 (2011) (\u201c[Contemporary crime-control] policies will be repudiated, or support for them weakened, only if enough of their proponents can be persuaded that they are unjust and cannot be morally justified.\u201d).[\/footnote] And that outrage is not going to be prompted by studies finding that the programs are success\u00adful\u2014if anything, such studies would be rejected as political.[footnote]See supra notes 161\u2013170 and accompanying text for discussion of responses to conflicting studies connected to ideological disagreement.[\/footnote] Appeals to values seem most likely to be successful to change the proposed policy.[footnote]See, e.g., Letter from David N. Cicilline &amp; Lou Barletta, Members of Cong., to Mick Mulvaney, Dir., Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget (Mar. 15, 2017), http:\/\/barletta.house.gov\/sites\/\r\nbarletta.house.gov\/files\/documents\/21st%20Century%20CLC%20OMB%20Letter.pdf [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/8UM7-FWBP] (asking President Trump to reinstate funding for after\u00adschool pro\u00adgrams based on appeals to values such as preventing turmoil for working families, promoting safety for kids, and allowing working parents to maintain jobs).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is also dangerous to frame policies that are really rooted in values as instead based on evidence because policies can take on a life of their own, sometimes ending up disconnected from, or even in opposition to, the values that originally prompted the policy.[footnote]Cf. Klingele, supra note 185, at 540\u201341 (\u201cAlthough most proponents of evidence-based correctional practices frame them as rehabilitative tools designed to reduce the use of incarceration and make correctional interventions more modest and humane, these tools are capable of doing the very opposite.\u201d).[\/footnote] Consider the rise of single-sex education over the last two decades. Early proponents included feminists who suggested that single-sex education could increase women\u2019s achievement.[footnote]See Rosemary Salomone, Rights and Wrongs in the Debate over Single-Sex Schooling, 93 B.U. L. Rev. 971, 976\u201377, 1027 (2013) (noting publications in the 1980s and 1990s that \u201creaffirmed the idea that American schools, overwhelmingly coed, were \u2018shortchanging\u2019 girls\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet they were soon joined by advocates peddling studies purporting to show differences in the way girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 brains learn; this development soon prompted schools to create single-sex classrooms to teach boys \u201cheroic behavior\u201d and allow them to run around while teach\u00ading girls \u201cgood character\u201d and encouraging them to sit while discussing their feelings.[footnote]See id. at 980\u201383.[\/footnote] Such policies entrench the very sex stereotypes that many of the original proponents of single-sex education intended to demolish.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when evidence is used ostensibly to justify a policy that ac\u00adtually stems from values, opponents of those values can use counterevi\u00addence to undercut the policy. For example, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education<\/em>, the Supreme Court famously (and controversially) relied in part on a study showing that black children preferred pink dolls to brown dolls to justify its ruling that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]347 U.S. 483, 494 &amp; n.11 (1954) (citing social science research to justify the prop\u00adosition that segregation \u201cwith the sanction of law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has a tendency to [retard] the educa\u00adtional and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the ben\u00adefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).[\/footnote] Segre\u00adgationists later used that same study to argue in favor of segregation, since the study showed that black children in segregated schools actually \u201cex\u00adhibited less negative reactions to the brown doll and showed less desire to play with the pink doll.\u201d[footnote]Joshua Dunn &amp; Martin West, Calculated Justice: Education Research and the Courts, <em>in<\/em> When Research Matters, supra note 14, at 155, 162\u201363.[\/footnote] So did the evidence show that it was better to maintain segregated schools? When values are in play, neither side is likely to convince the other side with a neutral appeal to evidence.[footnote]See, e.g., Lindblom &amp; Cohen, supra note 24, at 52 (connecting the perceived \u201cau\u00adthoritativeness\u201d of social science research for its users with the extent to which the research \u201csquares with their ideology or conforms to their general world view or epistemological position\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a debate among education scholars and practi\u00adtioners about what school reform should properly focus on: fixing the system as it exists, or reimagining the system entirely.[footnote]See, e.g., David Tyack &amp; Larry Cuban, Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform 1 (1995) (describing the tension in Americans\u2019 attitude toward school reform as one between \u201cutopian thinking\u201d and \u201ctinkering,\u201d each with both positive and neg\u00adative connotations).[\/footnote] Evidence is more likely to play a helpful role in the former than the latter.[footnote]See Head, supra note 163, at 84 (\u201cEvidence-based arguments about \u2018fine-tuning\u2019, based on careful research about effectiveness, might be more likely to gain traction in those areas that are away from the political heat.\u201d).[\/footnote] And tinkering can be valuable.[footnote]See, e.g., Tyack &amp; Cuban, supra note 243, at 10 (discussing \u201ca positive kind of tinkering, adapting knowledgeably to local needs and circumstances, preserving what is valuable and correcting what is not\u201d); cf. Paul Butler, The System Is Working the Way It Is Supposed to: The Limits of Criminal Justice Reform, 104 Geo. L.J. 1419, 1466 (2016) (ex\u00adplaining that in some circumstances, \u201cratchets\u201d\u2014those things that \u201csomewhat work some\u00adtimes\u201d\u2014can be useful).[\/footnote] But focusing too much on evidence to help us tinker can distract us from asking fundamental questions about the point of the whole endeavor.[footnote]See, e.g., Tyack &amp; Cuban, supra note 243, at 10\u201311 (arguing for \u201ca vision of a just democracy\u201d instead of the \u201cradically restricted\u201d debates over \u201ceducational and social goals\u201d that have been recently prevalent); cf. Butler, supra note 245, at 1466\u201368 (arguing that addressing \u201cratchets\u201d in criminal justice reform should not take the place of larger substan\u00ad\u00adtive changes).[\/footnote] At a moment when the direction of (and perhaps existence of) public education is at a crossroads,[footnote]Compare Nathan Diament, Opinion, The Power of School Choice, Wash. Times (Jan. 12, 2017), http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2017\/jan\/12\/the-power-of-school-choice\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/Q63P-6KHD] (arguing that \u201cDonald Trump and Betsy DeVos can improve K-12 education through choice\u201d), with Rebecca Mead, Betsy DeVos and the Plan to Break Public Schools, New Yorker (Dec. 14, 2016), http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/\r\ndaily-comment\/betsy-devos-and-the-plan-to-break-public-schools [http:\/\/perma.cc\/9MSS-QM9F] (arguing that the new Administration\u2019s \u201cideological embrace of choice\u201d ignores the idea of the \u201cpublic school as a public good\u201d and unsettles the \u201cfundamental premises that under\u00adlie our institutions of public education\u201d).[\/footnote] this latter conversa\u00adtion is critical. If the debate simmering beneath technocratic discussions about evidence is really between Black Lives Matter[footnote]See, e.g., Emily Deruy, How Black Lives Matter Activists Plan to Fix Schools, Atlantic (Aug. 5, 2016), http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/education\/archive\/2016\/08\/the-ambitious-education-plan-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement\/494711\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/AC99-KKC9].[\/footnote] and God\u2019s King\u00addom,[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin Wermund, Trump\u2019s Education Pick Says Reform Can \u2018Advance God\u2019s Kingdom,\u2019 Politico (Dec. 2, 2016), http:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2016\/12\/betsy-devos-education-trump-religion-232150 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/VA6R-4QML].[\/footnote] those technocratic discussions are not likely to accomplish much.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nESSA\u2019s calls for evidence-based policymaking have an intuitive appeal. Of course we should spend our limited public dollars on what works, and we should not spend our limited public dollars on what does not. The complexities outlined above do not indicate that we should disregard evidence or give up in despair on the research endeavor, believing that data exist only in the eye of the beholder or that we are each entitled to our own facts.[footnote]Cf. Majone, supra note 227, at 10\u201311 (\u201cEvidence is not synonymous with data or information\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Facts can be evaluated in terms of more or less objective canons, but evidence must be evaluated in accordance with a number of factors peculiar to a given situation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWe should, however, be more realistic about our expectations for evidence-based policymaking in education and other social policies. We must understand that the answer to the question of \u201cwhat works\u201d will al\u00adways be more complicated than a sound bite; research brooks no easy an\u00adswers, and implementation is messy. We must also understand that asking \u201cwhat works\u201d is itself a value-laden question. What works for what? For whom? To what end?[footnote]See Greenhalgh &amp; Russell, supra note 222, at 315 (\u201c[R]esearch evidence can and should inform policy judgments\u2014but this evidence does not in and of itself provide the answer to the ethical question of \u2018what to do\u2019 (and in particular, \u2018how to allocate resources\u2019).\u201d); Hess, Conclusion, supra note 25, at 253\u201354 (\u201cResearch has a vital role to play in demo\u00adcratic policy debate\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to dictate outcomes or to presume that public officials should be the handmaidens of researchers, but to ensure that public decisionmaking is informed by all the facts, insights, and analyses that the tools of science can provide.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe authors of the important 2002 National Research Council report on scientific research in education referenced above argued that the \u201ccompelling culture of democratic accountability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. demands evidence that public monies are wisely spent.\u201d[footnote]See Feuer et al., supra note 134, at 5; see also supra text accompanying note 169.[\/footnote] This is true. But the compelling culture of democratic accountability also demands vigorous debate about the underlying goals to which public monies are put. We ought to high\u00adlight this debate whenever calls for evidence-based policymaking imply that technocratic, value-free solutions are only a research study away.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the invocations of evidence in ESSA. It is good to encourage decisionmakers to canvas their needs and examine what research might help them meet those needs. But evidence require\u00adments do not provide a meaningful way to constrain decisionmaking in education, nor are they likely to provide the answers that will fix the sys\u00adtem once and for all. We should not let a focus on evidence distract us from the democratic debate at the core of education. In conversations about the right path forward for education policy\u2014and other policies that form the fabric of our democracy\u2014we ignore discussions of values at our peril.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
