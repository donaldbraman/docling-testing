## Strategies Used

### 1. **Sitemap Discovery** → 16 articles found ✅
   - **Method:** Parsed wp-sitemap-posts-post-1.xml
   - **Result:** Found 206 URLs, filtered to 93 potential articles
   - **Checked:** First 30 articles (limited for efficiency)

   - **Why it worked:** Wisconsin Law Review uses WordPress CMS with clean sitemap organization

### 2. **Browse Recent Issues** → Not needed (target exceeded)
   - **Status:** Skipped - Sitemap discovery was sufficient
   - **Note:** Would be effective as backup strategy

### 3. **Search Strategy** → Not attempted (target exceeded)
   - **Status:** Not needed
   - **Note:** Site has search but sitemap was more efficient

### 4. **RSS Feed** → Not attempted (target exceeded)
   - **Status:** Not needed

## Blockers Encountered

### Blocker 1: Initial Domain Connection Timeout
- **Issue:** Original URL (wisconsinlawreview.org) timed out
- **Resolution:** Discovered redirect to wlr.law.wisc.edu using curl follow-redirects
- **Impact:** 30 seconds additional discovery time
- **Lesson:** Always check for redirects on initial connection failure

### Blocker 2: Print Articles Have No HTML
- **Issue:** Print journal articles only provide PDFs (no HTML article pages)
- **Resolution:** Focused on WLR Forward and WLR Online articles which have both formats
- **Impact:** Lower conversion rate but sufficient volume
- **Lesson:** Law reviews often have separate digital/online editions with full HTML

### No Other Blockers
- ✅ No 403 Forbidden errors
- ✅ No 429 Rate Limiting encountered
- ✅ No authentication/paywall barriers
- ✅ No CAPTCHA challenges
- ✅ No download failures

## robots.txt Compliance

**Checked:** https://wlr.law.wisc.edu/robots.txt

**Findings:**
- User-agent: * (applies to all crawlers)
- Disallow: /wp-admin/ (respected - not accessed)
- Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php (not needed)
- Sitemap: https://wlr.law.wisc.edu/wp-sitemap.xml (used)
- **No Crawl-delay specified** (used conservative 2.5s anyway)

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Full compliance
- Used official sitemap
- Respected admin exclusions
- Implemented rate limiting
- Used appropriate User-Agent

---

## Rate Limiting Details

**Strategy:**
- 2.5 seconds between all requests
- Sequential downloads (no parallel requests)
- Total requests: ~48 (30 checks + 32 downloads)
- Total bandwidth: ~3.5 MB
- Peak rate: 0.4 requests/second
- Well below typical limits (1-2 req/sec)

**Result:** No throttling or blocking encountered

---

## Expansion Potential

### Remaining Articles
- **Sitemap Total:** 206 URLs
- **Checked:** 30 articles
- **Remaining:** 63 potential articles (after filtering)
- **Estimated Additional Pairs:** ~33 more (at 53% success rate)
- **Total Potential:** 49 pairs from Wisconsin Law Review

### Future Collection Strategy
1. Run discovery script on remaining 63 articles
2. Prioritize articles ≥5,000 words for highest quality data
3. Check recent WLR Forward articles (2023-2025) for newer content
4. Estimated time: 3-4 minutes for remaining articles

### Journal Series Available
- WLR Print: 2023-2025 issues (PDF-only, skip for now)
- WLR Forward: Current online articles (HTML+PDF)
- WLR Online: Historical online articles (HTML+PDF, many already collected)

## Recommendations for Next Round

### What Worked Well
1. **Start with sitemap discovery** - Most efficient for WordPress sites
2. **Filter URLs before checking** - Saved time by excluding obvious non-articles
3. **Verify before download** - Prevented wasted bandwidth
4. **Conservative rate limiting** - No blocks encountered
5. **Detailed logging** - Easy to debug and resume

### Optimizations for Future Collections
1. **Parallel checking (with rate limits)** - Could check 2-3 articles simultaneously
2. **Word count threshold** - Filter articles <3,000 words during discovery
3. **Date filtering** - Prioritize recent articles (2020+) for modern layouts
4. **Batch downloads** - Group downloads by year/issue for better organization

### Applicable to Other Journals
This strategy works well for:
- ✅ WordPress-based law reviews
- ✅ Journals with online/digital editions
- ✅ Open-access publications
- ✅ Sites with XML sitemaps

Less applicable for:
- ❌ PDF-only journals (need different strategy)
- ❌ Paywalled content (requires authentication)
- ❌ JavaScript-heavy sites (need browser automation)

## Technical Notes

### Scripts Created
**`scripts/data_collection/discover_wlr_articles.py`**
- Purpose: Sitemap parsing and article verification
- Dependencies: requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml
- Output: JSON file with verified article metadata
- Runtime: ~90 seconds for 30 articles

**`scripts/data_collection/download_wlr_pairs.py`**
- Purpose: Automated HTML+PDF download
- Dependencies: requests, beautifulsoup4
- Output: HTML/PDF files + detailed reports
- Runtime: ~50 seconds for 16 pairs

### Reusability
Both scripts are **parameterized** and can be adapted for other WordPress-based law reviews by changing:
- `BASE_URL` constant
- `SITEMAP_URL` pattern
- Output filename prefix

**Estimated effort to adapt:** 5-10 minutes per journal
