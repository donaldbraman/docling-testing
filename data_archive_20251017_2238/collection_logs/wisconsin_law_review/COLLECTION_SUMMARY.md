## Blockers Encountered

**None.** Collection was successful without any significant blockers.

**Minor Issues:**
- Some older article URLs from early sitemap entries returned 404 (expected for migrated content)
- Many articles in print issues lack HTML versions (expected behavior - print-only)

---

## Future Expansion Potential

The sitemap contained 206 total URLs with 93 potential article URLs. We checked 30 and found 16 pairs (53% success rate).

**Estimated Remaining:**
- Unchecked articles: 63
- Estimated additional pairs: 33 (at 53% rate)
- **Total potential:** 49 HTML-PDF pairs from Wisconsin Law Review

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Run discovery script on remaining 63 articles
2. Filter for articles ≥5,000 words for highest quality training data
3. Consider recent WLR Forward articles (2023-2025) for newer content

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Sitemap-first approach** - Most efficient discovery method
2. **Verification before download** - Prevented wasted bandwidth
3. **WordPress detection** - Identified site structure quickly
4. **Rate limiting** - No blocks or throttling encountered

### Unique Characteristics
- Wisconsin Law Review publishes both print (PDF-only) and online editions
- Online articles (WLR Forward) consistently include both HTML and PDF
- Print articles are PDF-only with no HTML versions
- Site uses WordPress with standard URL patterns

### Applicable to Other Journals
This strategy would work well for other WordPress-based law reviews with online/digital editions. Less applicable to journals that only publish PDF versions.
