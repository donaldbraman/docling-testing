"When  Freddie  Gray woke  up  on  April  12, 2015, he  surely  did  not know  that  he  would  soon  enter a coma  only  to  die  a week  later. That morning,  he  walked  to  breakfast  in  his  old  West  Baltimore  neighborhood with two of his best  friends. 1 The  restaurant  they wanted  to visit was closed,  however,  so  they left. 2 At some  point on the  way home, they encountered police officers on  bicycles. 3 After a  brief  chase,  Gray stopped voluntarily,  at which point officers  arrested him. 4 Video  footage shows  the  officers  savagely  shoving  Gray's face  into  the  sidewalk  and twisting his arms and legs. 5 Unable to stand  or walk,  Gray was dragged to the  back of a police  van where he would  spend the next forty minutes handcuffed,  shackled,  unbuckled,  and, while  conscious,  begging  for  his twenty-five-year-old  life  as  the  officers  drove  around  the  city  making several  stops. 6 Eventually,  Gray  emerged  unconscious  with  a  nearly severed  spinal  cord  and  a crushed  voice  box. 7 Paramedics  later  transferred  him  to  the  Maryland  Shock  Trauma  Center,  where  he  remained comatose  for a week  before dying. 8",cover_heinonline,2018 - The Paradox of Progressive Prosecution Notes.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The civil  rights community celebrated  this development,  which came on the heels  of officers  in other jurisdictions being  cleared  of any wrongdoing for killing black men. 1 3 Mosby was lauded  for wielding her  position  as  the  city's chief  prosecutor  to  insist  on  police  accountability. 1 4 Mosby  herself  seemed  to  have  anticipated  this  support. At  the  press conference  announcing  the  charges,  she  spoke  directly  to  the  protestors when she assured:  ""I  heard your  calls  for  'no justice,  no  peace!"" 15 But things did  not go  according to  plan. In  a rousing  press  conference  after the first three  of  the  officers  were  acquitted,  Mosby  announced  that she was professionally  compelled  to drop  the  charges  against  the  remaining three officers  despite the horrific injustice. 16 She decried  the trouble  and pain  ""mothers  and  fathers  all  across  this  country,  specifically  Freddie Gray's mother Gloria Darden,  or  Richard  Shipley,  Freddie  Gray's stepfather,  [go]  through  on  a  daily  basis  knowing  their  son's mere  decision to run  from  the  police  proved  to  be  a  lethal  one."""" Despite  the  acquittals,  she  described  Gray as  an  ""innocent  25-year-old  man  who  was  unreasonably  taken  into  custody  after fleeing  in  his  neighborhood,  which just happens  to be  a high crime  neighborhood.""""",cover_heinonline,2018 - The Paradox of Progressive Prosecution Notes.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Mosby's statements  seem  to  imply that  there  was  something  inherently unfair  about targeting Gray simply because  he was in a high-crime area. It is  deeply  ironic  for  Mosby  to make  this  argument. Just  a  few weeks  before  Gray's death,  Mosby instructed  the  Division  Chief of her office's Crime  Strategies  Unit  to target  the  exact  intersection  where  the officers  first  encountered  Gray North Ave.  and  Mount  St. with enhanced drug enforcement efforts. 19 Acting on this directive, the",cover_heinonline,2018 - The Paradox of Progressive Prosecution Notes.pdf,pdf_first_page

## TOWARD A RADICAL IMAGINATION OF LAW,cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In this Article, I  consider the contemporary law reform project of a  radical  social movement  seeking to  transform the state: specifically, that of the  Movement for Black Lives as articulated  in its policy platform ""A  Vision for Black Lives: Policy Demands  for Black Power,  Freedom, and  Justice."" The Movement for Black Lives is  the leading  example of a contemporary racial justice movement with an intersectional politics including feminist and anti-capitalist  commitments.  The  visions of such radical  social movements offer  an alternative  epistemology for understanding and addressing  structural  inequality. By studying not only the critiques  offered  by radical social movements,  but also  their visions for  transformative change,  the edges of law scholarship  can be expanded,  a deeper  set of critiques  and a longer  set of histories-of  colonialism and settler colonialism, the Atlantic slave  trade and mass incarceration-centered, and a bolder project of transformation  forwarded. These visions should  push legal scholars  toward a broader  frame  for understanding how law,  the market, and the state co-produce intersectional  structural  inequality, and toward agendas that  focus not on building  the power of  law and  the police, but on  building the power of marginalized communities and transforming the state. This shift would invigorate the social movement's literature  and bring new  energy to scholarship  on substantive areas of law, from criminal  and immigration law to property and contract law.",cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"To illustrate  the creative  potential of  studying radical  social  movements, this Article contrasts the  Vision  for  Black  Lives  with  the  Department of Justice's (DOJ) Ferguson and Baltimore reports. The  Vision and the DOJ reports offer alternate conceptualizations  of the problem of  policing  and the  appropriate  approach  to law",cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"reform. Reflective of liberal  law reform projects  on police,  the DOJ  reports  identify policing  as a  fundamental tool of law and  order  that  serves the collective interests  of society, and locate the problems  of  police in their  failure to adhere to constitutional law.  As  a corrective, the DOJ reports advocate for investing more  resources in police:  more  trainings, better  supervision, community  policing. In  contrast, the Vision identifies policing as a  historical  and violent force in  Black communities underpinning a system  of racial capitalism and limiting the possibilities  of Black life.  Law is  central to  the shape and legitimation of this racialized violence and inequality.  As such, policing  as we  now know it cannot  be fixed.  Thus, the  Vision's reimagination  of policing-rooted  in  Black  history  and Black  intellectual traditions-transforms  mainstream approaches to reform. In  forwarding a  decarceral agenda rooted in  an abolitionist  imagination, the  Vision  demands shrinking the large footprint of policing, surveillance, and incarceration and shifting resources into housing,  health care,  jobs, and  schools. The  Vision focuses on building  power in Black communities  and transforming  the relationship  between state, market, and society.  In  so  doing, the  movement  offers  transformative,  affirmative  visions for change designed to address the structures of inequality-something  legal scholarship has lacked for far too long.",cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2018 - Toward a Radical Imagination of Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

I  wanted  them  to  understand  that  contemporary  movements struggled with questions  similar to those in  the texts  we labored  over. That's how  an  organizer  found himself  surrounded by future  lawyers.

"Our  intellectual  distance  from  the texts  vanished,  and  our  lively conversation  ended with  a  question:  What  is  the  proper  role  of lawyers  within  the  movement?  After  a  short  pause,  Hayes  praised  the technical  chops  and  procedural  expertise  lawyers  bring  to  the  table. But  that  is  not  enough,  he  said.  ""Most  lawyers  see  a  problem  and think,  'How can  I fix  this  law?""' This  view  is  too  narrow:  it  obscures the stakes  and  concedes  to status  quo arrangements.  ""The  role  of the law is to protect the  state,""  Hayes reasoned. ""Lawyers  must work with movements  to  imagine  with  us  the  kind  of  state  we  want  to  live  in.

"Since  the Ferguson and Baltimore uprisings, legal scholarship has  undergone  a  profound  reckoning  with  police violence.  The emerging structural  account of police violence  recognizes that it is routine, legal,  takes many shapes,  and targets people based on  their race,  class,  and gender.  But  legal  scholarship remains fixated  on investing in the police to repair  and relegitimize their social  function without  paying sufficient  attention  to alternate frameworks  for reform. The  2020  uprisings sparked by  the  police killing of George Floyd mobilized  demands  rooted  in  prison  abolitionist organizing  that provide another  way forward. In contrast  to conventional reform,  the calls  to defund and  dismantle  the police confront  head-on the violence, scale, and power of the police,  and therefore aim to  redress police violence  by  diminishing the  scale,  scope,  and legitimacy of police function.  These  calls are an important aspect of a practical  agenda aimed  at  eliminating prisons  and police  and  building  modes  of collective care and social provision where  reform  is one  essential strategy.",cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf,pdf_first_page

"I was sitting in that room. It was  the first time that I had heard anyone  argue that reforming  police would not stop the violence-that the only way to decrease police  violence  was  to  decrease  the  number  of police.  For  at  least  a  decade, scholars  had  debated  approaches  to  decarceration, 3 but few  had  considered the possibility of  shrinking  the  police. Many  championed  the  reforms  Herzing dismissed.  But Herzing convinced  me  then that the  violence  and scale of police were  fundamentally  intertwined with  that of incarceration.

She spoke  with  a searing  clarity  about the  stakes: the  lives of millions of people defined  in one way or another by the  violence  of prisons  and police.

I  have  spent  several  years  struggling  with  Herzing's remarks  and the  turn toward  abolition. I  knew Herzing  was right  to argue  that the police reforms that occupied  the  field  of  scholarly  debate  had  not  curbed  police  violence.  But  to admit as  much out  loud felt like  failure.  And it  was  beyond my  imagination  to conjure  a  world  that did  not rely  on  prisons  and police  or to  believe  we  could muster the sustained mass political  struggle needed  to build that  world.,cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf,pdf_first_page
"But the  orientation  toward  transformation  of state  and society,  rather  than police reform,  provides a more honest assessment  than liberal  legal frameworks about what it  will take to  fight mass  criminalization  and the failures  of reform. The  scale,  power,  and  violence  of  police  and  prisons-rooted  in  histories  of enslavement  and conquest-have  become defining pieces  of architecture  within our  political  economy.  Ending  our  reliance  on  prisons  and  police  requires  a radical  and capacious  path  focused on transforming  structures  of our world and our relationships  to each other.",cover_heinonline,Akbar - 2020 - An Abolitionist Horizon for _Police_ Reform.pdf,pdf_first_page

"As courtroom disruption became a  national issue in  the  late 1960's, public attention focused primarily on the  conduct of the  criminal defense attorney and  his client. Professor Alschuler  examines  the  courtroom  misconduct of  prosecutors and trial judges both  as  it  relates to  disruptive behavior by defendants and  defense attorneys and  as  it poses a  threat in  its own right to  the  orderly administration of  justice.",cover_heinonline,Alschuler - 1971 - Courtroom Misconduct by Prosecutors and Trial Judges.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Debates over mass incarceration emphasize policing, bail, and sentencing reform, but give little attention to indigent defense. This omission seems surprising, given that interactions with government-provided counsel critically shape the experience of the vast majority of criminal defendants. This neglect in part reflects our lack of evidence-based knowledge regarding indigent defense, making it difficult to identify effective reforms.",cover_jstor,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf,pdf_first_page
"One approach that continues to gain support is holistic defense, in which public defenders work in interdisciplinary teams to address both the immediate case and the underlying life circumstances - such as drug addiction, mental illness, or family or housing instability - that contribute to client contact with the criminal justice system. Holistic defense contrasts with the traditional public defense model that emphasizes criminal representation and courtroom advocacy. Proponents contend holistic defense improves case outcomes and reduces recidivism by better addressing clients' underlying needs, while critics argue that diverting resources and attention from criminal advocacy weakens results. Although the holistic approach is widely embraced, there is no systematic evidence demonstrating the relative merits of the holistic approach.",cover_jstor,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article offers the first large-scale, rigorous evaluation of the impact of holistic defense on criminal justice outcomes. In the Bronx, New York City, a holistic defense provider (the Bronx Defenders) and a traditional defender (the Legal Aid Society) operate side-byside within the same court system, with case assignment determined quasi-randomly based on court shift timing. Using administrative data covering over half a million cases and a quasi-experimental research design, we estimate the causal effect of holistic defense on case outcomes and future offending. Holistic defense does not affect conviction rates, but it reduces the likelihood of a custodial sentence by 16 % and expected sentence length by 24 %. Over the ten-year study period, holistic defense in the Bronx resulted in nearly 1 . 1",cover_jstor,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf,pdf_first_page

"While holistic defense does not dramatically reduce recidivism, as some proponents have claimed, strengthening indigent defense apparently offers considerable potential to reduce incarceration without harming public safety. Accordingly, this promising model deserves future research - beyond the criminal justice system and in other jurisdictions - and a more prominent place in conversations about how to address mass incarceration.",cover_jstor,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf,pdf_first_page
"he vast majority of U.S. criminal defendants receive governmentprovided counsel, 1 so methods for organizing, staffing, and appointing indigent defense counsel have far-reaching effects on the criminal justice system. One recent promising development in indigent defense is the growing recognition that an indigent client may be best served by a team of professionals that addresses a range of the clients needs rather than simply a heroic solitary lawyer who represents a defendant solely at criminal trial. 2 This notion is embodied by the holistic defense model.

"According to its proponents, the key insight of holistic defense is that to be truly effective advocates for their clients, defenders must adopt a broader understanding of the scope of their work with their clients. Defenders must address both the enmeshed, or collateral, legal consequences of criminal justice involvement (such as loss of employment, public housing, custody of ones children, and immigration status), as well as underlying nonlegal issues that often play a role in driving clients into the criminal justice system in the first place. 3 To this end, holistic defender offices are staffed not only by criminal defense lawyers and related support staff (investigators and paralegals) but also by civil, family, and immigration lawyers as well as social workers and nonlawyer advocates, all working collectively and on an equal footing with criminal defense lawyers. This holistic model contrasts with the traditional public defense model, which focuses almost exclusively on criminal representation.",cover_jstor,Anderson et al. - 2019 - The Effects of Holistic Defense on Criminal Justice Outcomes.pdf,pdf_first_page

## ADMINISTERING CRIME,cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2004 - Administering Crime.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Although agencies are  the  dominant force  in  criminal law today, existing scholarship has largely failed to  analyze how these  bodies perform  as agencies. We  know  little about  how  the  institutional design of  these  agencies affects their output or  whether the  politics of regulation are  different when an  agency  is responsible for  the  regulation of  criminal justice issues as opposed  to  traditional regulatory areas.  This  Article takes  up that task  by evaluating the  agencies charged  with regulating one of the  most  important aspects of  criminal law:  sentencing. Many reformers turned to  agencies to  regulate sentencing because  they  did  not  trust the political process on its own  to  produce  rational sentencing policy in  a  tough-oncrime  culture. This Article explores what  kind of  model  works  for regulating criminal sentences if the  goal is to  create an  influential agency  that can  temper rash political impulses.  Drawing  from administrative law,  political science, and the actual experience of  state and federal commissions, the Article demonstrates thatcontrary to  conventional wisdom-the agency  model can  succeed.  But,  unlike other substantive areas where  an  independent agency  is seen  as  the  most  effective, an  insulated agency  model  is not a  viable answer  when the  agency  is responsible for regulating criminal sentencing. Instead, agencies responsible for sentencing are more efficacious when  they  are  politically enmeshed and  operate largely like  interest groups.

"Scholars have written volumes  about the separation of  powers, but they  have focused on  the administrative  state  and have  wholly  ignored  the  criminal state. Judges,  too,  have failed to  distinguish criminal from administrative  matters.  So, the conventional wisdom has been that whatever theory works  for  the administrative  state  should work for anything else,  including  criminal matters. Because most  scholars  and judges have  supported  a flexible or functional approach to  separation of  powers in  the regulatory sphere, they have  failed to see a problem  with  the functional  approach  in criminal cases.  Indeed,  the  Supreme Court has been  even  more  permissive  of the  blending of powers in  the criminal context than it has in cases  involving  nonpenal laws.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2005 - Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article  shows  why  the  existing  functional  approach  to  separation  of powers  in criminal matters cannot be squared with  constitutional theory or sound institutional  design. It explains that  there are  crucial differences between administrative  and criminal matters  when  it comes  to  the separation of  powers. Maintaining the separation of  powers in criminal matters has strong roots  in the Constitution's  text and  structure. Moreover, unlike the administrative law context,  where agencies must adhere to  the structural and  procedural protections of the Administrative  Procedure Act  and their decisions  are  subject  to judicial review and political oversight, the  government  faces  almost  no  institutional checks  when  it proceeds  in criminal matters.

"individual rights provisions of the Constitution,  but those act as poor safeguards against structural  abuses and inequities.  The current arrangement therefore  takes the  worst possible  approach to  separation of  powers  in the  criminal context. The protection  provided  by  the  separation of  powers is  weakened, but nothing takes its place.  As  a result,  the potential  for  government  abuse is,  perversely,  greater in criminal proceedings than in regulatory matters.  This Article  therefore advocates more  stringent enforcement of the separation of  powers in criminal cases,  where it is most needed. This approach would  lead to  different outcomes  in the Court's major separation of  powers cases  dealing  with criminal matters and would  result in a  rethinking of its  acceptance  of unreviewable  prosecutorial discretion  over charging and plea bargaining.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2005 - Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The  rise  of  the  administrative  state  put  a  spotlight  on  this  cost of  the separation  of  powers. New  Dealers  in  favor  of  a  more  efficient and  active federal  government  argued  for a  relaxation  of  the division  of powers  to  allow agencies to  combine government  functions in  order  to address  social  and economic  ills. 4 Instead  of relying  on  separated powers  as the primary means  of protection against  government  abuse, they  proposed  other  checks on  state power.  For example,  the Administrative  Procedure Act (APA) requirements of notice  and comment, 5 of  separation between  law  enforcers  and adjudicators, 6 and of  judicial  review 7 were  designed  to  perform  the  same  functions  as  the Constitution's  separation  of  powers  safeguards,  but  without  hamstringing  the government's ability to respond rapidly to the nation's problems.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2005 - Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Federal  prosecutors wield enormous power.  They  have the  authority to make charging decisions, enter  cooperation agreements, accept  pleas, and often dictate sentences or sentencing ranges.  There are currently no  effective  legal checks  in  place  to  police the  manner in which  prosecutors exercise  their discretion. As  a result,  in the  current era dominated by pleas instead of  trials, federal  prosecutors  are not merely law enforcers. They are the  final  adjudicators in  the  95%  of cases  that are not  tried before  a federal  judge  or jury.  In  a government whose hallmark  is supposed to be the separation  of  powers, federal prosecutors are a glaring  and dangerous exception.  They have the  authority  to take away liberty, yet  they are often  the  final  judges in their  own cases. One need not be  an  expert in separation-of-powers theory to know  that combining these powers in a single actor  can lead  to gross abuses. Indeed, the combination  of  law enforcement and  adjudicative  power  in a single  prosecutor  is the most significant design flaw  in  the  federal  criminal  system. Although  scholars  have  made persuasive cases  for greater external controls on prosecutors, these  calls for reform  are  unrealistic in  the  current political climate.  The  solution  must  be sought elsewhere.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2008 - Institutional Design and the Policing of Prosecutors Lessons from Administrative Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article looks  within  the prosecutor's  office  itself  to  identify a  viable corrective on prosecutorial  overreaching. In particular, by  heeding lessons of institutional  design  from  administrative  law,  this Article considers how  federal prosecutors' offices could  be  designed  to  curb  abuses  of power  through separation-of-functions  requirements and greater attention to  supervision. The problems posed  by  federal prosecutors' combination  of  adjudicative and enforcement functions are the  very  same  issues raised by  the  administrative state-and  the  solutions fit  equally well in  both  settings. In  both  instances, individuals  who  make investigative  and advocacy  decisions should be  separated",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2008 - Institutional Design and the Policing of Prosecutors Lessons from Administrative Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

## Insulating Agencies: Avoiding  Capture  Through Institutional Design,cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page
"So-called independent agencies are created for a  reason, and  often that reason is a  concern with  agency capture. Agency  designers hope  that a  more insulated agency  will better protect the  general public interest against interest group pressure. But  the  conventional approach to  independent agencies in  administrative law  largely ignores why agencies are  insulated. Instead, discussions about independent agencies in  administrative law have focused on three features that have  defined independent agencies: heads  who are removable for cause by the  President, an  exemption from  having to  submit regulations to  the  President's Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs for cost-benefit analysis, and  a  multimember  structure.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page
"But  these traditional characteristics of an independent agency  are  not the  only, or  necessarily even the  most  effective, ways in  which insulation from  interest groups and  partisan pressure can  be  achieved. In  fact, under modern conditions of political oversight, other design elements and  mechanisms  are often just as  important if the goal is to  create an  agency  that is best suited to  achieve a  long-term public-interest mission free from  capture. This is particularly true of agencies tasked with  protecting the  general public in the face  of one-sided and  intense political pressure. This  kind  of lopsided pressure can  be  seen  in  a  range of areas, from  criminal justice to  consumer protection.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The goal  of this Article is  to  move  the  conversation about  insulation beyond the  traditional hallmarks of independence and  identify overlooked elements  of agency  design, deemed ""equalizing factors, "" that are  particularly well-suited to  addressing the  problem  of  capture in the  context of asymmetrical political pressure. The  Article identifies five such  equalizing factors that have  received little or  no attention in  the  legal literature on independent agencies but  that are  critically important for  insulation against one-sided interest group dominance.

"According  to the  existing legal  literature and case law,  the  defining hallmark of  an independent agency  is  that it is  headed by someone who cannot  be  removed  at  will by the  President but  instead can  be removed only  for good cause.' This  one  design feature has  spawned countless law  review  articles  about  the  meaning of  separation of  powers,  the  nature of  the  unitary executive, and  the  constitutional pedigree of the  New  Deal  and the  explosion of  agencies with  this attribute. 2 The Supreme Court  and lower  courts have considered the  removal  question at  length, with  the  latest chapter coming last Term when the  Court  held  that it was unconstitutional for  Congress  to  place ""dual for-cause  limitations on  the removal"" of members  of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board (PCAOB) by vesting  the  removal power in  the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose members",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The obsessive focus  on removal  as  the  touchstone of  independence  is curious because  insulation from the  President is  often not  the  dominant  reason  why policy makers  seek  to  create independent agencies in  the  first place. Rather, the  goal  of  insulation is  frequently to  allow  an  agency  to  protect the diffuse interest of  the  general public or  a vulnerable segment  of  the  public that, because  of  collective action problems  or  resource limitations, is  often outgunned  in  the  political process by well-financed and  politically influential special interests. The insulated agency,  its designers hope,  will better resist short-term partisan pressures and instead place  more emphasis  on empirical facts that will serve  the  public interest in  the long  term.  Put  another way,  the creation of  an independent  agency is  often  motivated by a concern with agency  capture.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page

In  fact, under  modern conditions of  political oversight, other design elements and  mechanisms are  often just as  important to  an  agency's ability to  achieve its long-term mission relatively free from capture. This  is  particularly true of agencies tasked with  protecting the  interests of  politically powerless groups, including the  dispersed general public, where  the  political pressure to  rule for more powerful, organized interests will be  intense and  one-sided. 6",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page

banking agencies to guard  against  lending abuses 8 to  the Minerals Management  Service's lack  of  oversight of  offshore drilling that led  to  the British Petroleum  disaster9-make clear that addressing capture remains  an urgent need. The brightest prospect for  doing  so lies in  intelligent agency design  that moves beyond  the  simple focus  on  presidential removal  decisions and  other traditional features of  agency  independence.,cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The Article begins in  Part I  by identifying the  main reasons why policy makers seek  to  create  independent agencies  in  the  first place, highlighting that a  concern  with  agency  capture and lopsided partisan and interest group pressure has  been  a  driving force. Part II  then  explores the  traditional factors associated with  independent agencies.  Removal protection for  agency  heads is  the  touchstone, but  independent agencies are  also  typically characterized by their multimember structure and  the  fact that, unlike executive agencies, they  do  not have  to  submit  cost-benefit analyses of proposed  rules for review by the  President's Office  of  Information and Regulatory Affairs. Part II  explains the  relationship between  these  traditional characteristics and the  goal of  limiting capture and one-sided political pressure. Part III then  goes  beyond  the  conventional mechanisms to  address additional design  features that have largely gone under  the  radar of  administrative law scholarship. These features are  an  agency's funding  source; qualifications for appointment  and post-employment  restrictions for  agency officials; the  agency's relationship with  other federal agencies; the  agency's relationship with  state-level actors; and various political tools, including the  agency's ability to  generate politically powerful  information, its ability to  recruit political benefactors, and  the potential for public advocates to  become part of  the agency  structure. Part III argues  that  these  factors, deemed  ""equalizing factors,"" are more  robust checks  against agency capture under  asymmetrical political conditions than the  use  of traditional factors alone.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2010 - Insulating Agencies Avoiding Capture through Institutional Design.pdf,pdf_first_page
"To illustrate the  limits of  the  traditional factors and  the  promise  of the equalizing factors, Part IV focuses on consumer-protection agencies, where capture is a  significant threat because the  public interest is  pitted against onesided powerful  interest group  pressure. The creation this year  of the  Bureau of Consumer  Financial Protection (CFPB)-the  most  important  federal agency  created in  decades  and one  charged with  the  Herculean  task of  regulating the  financial services industry to  protect consumers-provides an  ideal case  study  for  considering the  importance of  institutional design.

"Thank you  very  much  for  having  me.  It's wonderful  to be here and in particular to be talking about Frank Zimring's  book.1 I first met Frank  shortly after I became  a  law professor.  I  don't know  if you'll remember  this,  Frank, but  it's in  my  mind  quite clearly. I was in awe.  It was  a panel at Columbia Law  School, I hadn't been in teaching for very long,  and I was  going to be on a panel  with him. I was explaining  the thesis of my paper,  which was an argument that fiscal changes in the states were  going to bring about bigger sentencing changes,  and analyzing why they wouldn't happen at the federal level because they weren't suffering from the  same kind of cost constraints  and the politics  were different. 2 I gave my presentation, and then, when it was Frank's turn,  he  said  that I was  practicing  social  science  without  a  license.  So,  Frank, I remain  an  unlicensed  social  science  driver, but I have  nevertheless  been  asked  to  take the  wheel  again  to comment  on both  your  book  and,  I  hope,  mine.  Thankfully  for me, you do all the hard  social science work in your draft and end up  backing  up  observations  that I make  in  my  own  book,  in which I use more  political  economy  and some  of the politics  and existing  research  and  data  that's out  there  on  mass  incarceration. But we reach many of the same conclusions,  and even come to many of the same proposed policies. So if a lawyer like me and a social  scientist like you end up  in the  same place,  we're either",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page

"To set the stage for my remarks I want to start with the central point that Frank  emphasizes  in the draft of the book  that I suspect  will  remain  the  same.  And  I highly recommend  it,  because  even  in draft  version  it's absolutely  fantastic.  One  of the things  he  emphasizes  is  that,  for  all  the  talk  around  criminal justice reform in the United States and the emphasis that there's bipartisan movement to get things done, all the data and trends instead point  to  us continuing  to  live  with  mass  incarceration and  excessive  criminalization  in  the United  States for the foreseeable future. 3  Frank explains in the book why there is so much momentum  for  mass  incarceration, and  reminds  us just  how modest the reforms  we've seen so far have been. 4",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page
"I'm  kind of a glass-is-half-empty kind of person,  and Frank's book  gives  me reason  to  be that way  when it comes to criminal justice reform. Although more than half the states have lowered their incarceration rates, which  is good, sixteen  states report an increase  in  the  number  of  prisoners  in 2016 as  compared  to 2007.5 Moreover,  if we look at the states that have lowered their prison  populations,  that decrease  is  actually pretty small when you compare it to  the prison buildup that took place before that. There  was  an increase  of seventy-seven  percent  between 1972 and 1981, but the  decrease,  from 2007 to 2016, was only about seven  percent. 6 So  that's an  eleven-to-one  differential. So  the glass is actually eleven-twelfths empty. The overall decrease was really driven by outliers  like  California,  which was responsible for  reducing  the number  of prisoners-and  I'm getting  a  lot  of these  stats  from  Frank's draft-by  almost  44,000  people. 7 The other forty-nine states combined reduced it only by 38,000.8 This is just to give you an outline about how this is not a story of largescale change  happening everywhere.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page

"I teach  and  write  about  criminal  law  and  administrative law,  as  Maria  [Ponomarenko]  pointed  out,  and  I  have  always been struck by the contrast between the two areas. In one space where I teach  and  talk  about  things,  we  value  expertise,  we value data,  we do cost-benefit  analysis, we  make our policymakers  explain why they're doing what they're doing,  and they face judicial review  to  make sure they're not  being arbitrary and capricious,  and then in the other space,  in criminal  law, we just let policymakers  go with their gut.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page
"You  know  the expression  when  you  are  in  law  school  that bad facts make bad law.  Criminal law is basically  writ large just one  example  of that.  We  get policies  that  are the  result of bad facts that are on the news,  or on social media, 9  and they may feel emotionally  satisfying at the time  to segments of our electorate, who think that these policies  are applying to the absolute  worst kinds of crimes that they are reading and hearing about. But, in fact,  these  policies  often  make  us  less  safe  in the  long  term because  of  how  difficult  they  make  it  for  people  to  successfully reenter after they've served  their terms of confinement,  because of the hurdles we have set up. 10",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page
"I think the way  out of this is to  recognize  that we  need  to make criminal justice  administration look  more  like  the  rest of administrative law.  And I think Frank agrees.  So, this is from  a draft,  but Frank  points  out  that a  truly sophisticated  administrative  law of crime  can lead to a parsimonious  and humane penal system. 11 Excessive punishment is evidence  of,  among other things,  bad management.1 2 I hope  this stays in,  Frank, because I agree  with it,  and I think this key about bad management  and bad policies is really central for us to take a close look at because I think that for  far too  long the  rhetoric-the bill  of goods  that have been  sold to  us-is that  these  are  the  policies  we  need  to",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page

I  am  going to highlight just a  few  resources  from my book to  give you a  sense  of what I am talking about.  The opening chapter explains  a dynamic that we  have in criminal  law  in  the  United  States  which  is  that we lump  together people  of really different levels  of culpability and we treat them all as if they are the worst possible offense in that category.1 4  And there are lots of examples  of this, but  in the interests of time I'll just give you a  couple.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page
"I'll start with one that I think people have an intuitive sense wouldn't be like this-the category of sex offender.  I think when the average  person  thinks  about  that term  of sex  offender  they are probably thinking of people who commit violent acts of rape, people  who  molest  children.  But if you look  at the  actual  laws that define  who qualifies  for being  a sex  offender  you  find they sweep  more  broadly  than  that.  There  was  a  Human  Rights Watch [report], for example,  that found five of the states require you to go on  a sex  offender  registry if you visited  a prostitute. 15 Thirteen  states  will  put  you  on  the  registry  if you  urinated  in public.' 6 Twenty-nine  states  require  registration  for  teenagers who have consensual  sex with another teenager.' 7",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2019 - Prisoners of Politics Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration The 2019 Minnesota Law Review Sympos.pdf,pdf_first_page

"CHARGED: THE NEW MOVEMENT TO TRANSFORM AMERICAN PROSECUTION  AND  END  MASS  INCARCERATION. By Emily Bazelon. New York:  Random  House.  2019.  Pp. xxxi,  409.  Cloth,  $24.99;  paper,  $17.99.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In her excellent book, Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution  and End Mass Incarceration, Emily Bazelon'  uses  the stories of  two  individuals  to  showcase  the  enormous  power  prosecutors  have  in  a criminal  case.  The  use  of these  narratives  makes  the  book  both  a  gripping read and a valuable  primer for understanding how important local  prosecutors  are  to the way punishment  operates  in America.  Showing  the authority prosecutors  have over  most aspects  of punishment  in America  is  the book's central  descriptive  contribution.  But  the  book  has  a  normative  agenda  as well. Bazelon argues that those seeking to  dismantle  mass  incarceration should  recognize  that the  power  of  prosecutors  can  be  an effective lever  of reform.  She argues that by electing  prosecutors concerned  about mass  incarceration, we  can start to shift course  away  from tough-on-crime  rhetoric that in  reality does  a poor job keeping  people  safe  and move  toward policies  that actually  work.  I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  Bazelon's descriptive  claim  that prosecutors are critical actors-probably the most important actor,  if we had to  choose  just  one-in  administering  criminal justice  policy  in  America.  I also  agree  that we  would  do  well  as  voters  to  select  prosecutors  who  understand what really works  to  fight  crime  and therefore  know that mass  incarceration is  not  the answer.  Electing  prosecutors  committed  to  decarceration is  an  improvement  over  the  status quo,  and  it  should be  a  vital part  of any reform agenda.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

"To  the  extent  Bazelon  and I  diverge,  it is  only  about  how  optimistic we should  be  about  this  movement  transforming  the  landscape. 2 Bazelon believes  that ""[t]he  movement  to  elect  a  new  kind of  prosecutor  is  the  most promising  means  of reform . .. on  the political  landscape"" (p.  296).  Bazelon could well  be right, but for that to happen, these progressive  prosecutors will have  to  successfully achieve  key institutional  reforms. Critically,  that  includes  imposing  real  checks  on prosecutors  themselves  (reform-minded or otherwise).  Indeed,  a  key  metric  for  identifying  whether  a  prosecutor  is,  in fact,  a real reformer,  as  opposed to  someone  who  is just seeking  a convenient label  as  a  progressive,  is  whether  or not  they  are  actively  pursuing reforms that limit the leverage  they have in  criminal cases,  such as  seeking  the  elimination  of  mandatory  minimum  sentences, promoting  open-file discovery laws,  pursuing the  end  of  cash bail  and the  dramatic curtailment  of pretrial detention,  accepting limits  on their use of state-prison  resources,  pushing for judicial  discretion  in sentencing,  advocating  for  robust second  looks  of  sentences  by  actors  other  than  prosecutors,  and  downsizing  their offices. For these  prosecutors to  achieve  real  reform, they will  need  not  only to  advocate for  these  positions but also  to  help  achieve  their realization-and that is  no small  task given  the  entrenched  opposition  to  all  of these  ideas,  including from prosecutors within their own  offices.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  Review  will  proceed  in three parts.  In Part I,  I  will  explain  why  Bazelon  is  right to focus  on prosecutors as key  actors under the current regime. While  scholars  have  documented the enormous  role prosecutors play  in virtually  every aspect of criminal law's administration and how  that leads  to the mass  incarceration we  currently have in America, 3 Bazelon's  book stands out for  its  ability to  make  this connection  vivid  and comprehensible  to an  average  reader with  no  legal  training or  deep  policy  expertise.  The  two  central stories  are gripping,  and you  cannot help  but want to  learn more  about the law and policies  that shape these tales.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  Part  II,  I  will  explain why  I  have  less optimism  than  Bazelon  does about using  prosecutor  elections  as  ""a shortcut  to  addressing a  lot  of  dysfunction""  (p.  xxx). I  think electing  reform-minded  prosecutors  is  a valuable step,  and I  do  not mean to  shortchange what some  of the people  in these  positions have already  accomplished. Many newly elected  progressive  prosecutors have already achieved laudable results and have done so in environments where  change was  not feasible  through other means.  But even with their gains,  it is  important  to  note that we  are a  long way  from  curbing",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

Put another way,  the unfortunate  truth is that simply changing who serves  as district  attorney  is  not  an  easy  shortcut  to  reducing  prison  and  jail populations by significant  amounts. 4",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"That  said,  Bazelon  and the  voters  and  activists  who  have  helped  elect progressive  prosecutors  are  right  that this  movement  has  the potential  to be transformative.  But bigger  changes  will happen  only  if these prosecutors  do more  than  seek  to  exercise  the  vast  discretion  of their  offices  more  wisely than their predecessors.  They need to  advocate  for institutional  changes,  including  changes  that  limit  the  leverage  prosecutors  have  over  defendants. Part  III thus identifies key  institutional reforms  that are  necessary to achieve more fundamental  change.  At their core,  these ideas  require placing  significant  checks  on  the powers  prosecutors  exercise  instead  of trying  to  change the type of people who  occupy those roles and how they exercise their broad discretion. Part  III  will  provide  a  summary  of what  some  of  those  checks should  look  like.  In  addition to  providing  a  list  of  needed  reforms,  this summary  can  serve  as  a  checklist  to  evaluate  prosecutors  who  claim  to  be progressive.  If  they  are  not  putting  their  full  support  behind  these  institutional changes,  one should question just how progressive they are.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Even  if prosecutors  pursue  all  these  reforms,  we  should  recognize  that they cannot dismantle mass  incarceration  on their own.  Real  change is going to  require  changes  in  police  departments,  the judiciary,  the  legislature,  and governors' offices. Most  fundamentally, transforming punishment in America  will  require  the  public  to  change  its  understanding  of the most  effective policies  for  crime  control. 5 Prosecutors have  long  lobbied  for the  get-tough approach as the way to address crime, 6 so this new breed of prosecutor needs to  take  the  lead in  explaining  why punishment  is  not  the  answer  to  deeper social problems that lead to crime  and violence.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

## I. THE POWER OF PROSECUTORS,cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Bazelon's book tells the  stories  of two  individuals facing  criminal  charges  and shows  how the fate of these  individuals lies  with their prosecutors.  In one case,  an overzealous Memphis  prosecutor,  Amy Weirich,  fails to disclose exculpatory evidence  in  violation  of Brady v.  Maryland to  obtain  a murder conviction  in a high-profile case against  a teenage girl named  Noura Jackson (p.  186). Weirich  is  representative  of  the  win-at-all-costs,  tough-on-crime prosecutor that we have seen in counties  across America.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Bazelon  contrasts  Weirich  with  Eric  Gonzalez,  the  district  attorney  in Brooklyn,  whom  she  portrays  as  a  prototypical  example  of a  new  breed  of progressive  prosecutor.  Gonzalez's  office  allows  the  other  central  character in  the book,  Kevin, 7 to  participate  in  a  diversion  program  that  would  allow dismissal  of charges  upon  successful  completion,  instead  of pursuing  more serious  charges against  Kevin  for  possessing  an unlicensed,  loaded  gun, which would  have  landed  him  in  prison  for  at  least  three  and  a  half years (pp. xxiv,  30).  Gonzalez,  in  Bazelon's telling,  represents  a  different  kind  of prosecutor  who  recognizes  that  incarceration  does  little  to  benefit  society, and instead  increases  the risk that  someone  will  commit more crimes  when they are released.",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Through the  stories  of Noura's and  Kevin's cases,  Bazelon  vividly  shows how prosecutors  hold  the  keys to  someone's liberty.  They make  the critical decisions about what to  charge, whether  to seek pretrial  detention,  and what sentence  to  pursue.  Bazelon  demonstrates  that courts largely remain  on the sidelines  for these  determinations  because  of the  deference  they give prosecutors.  Although  judges could  release  pretrial  defendants  on bail  even  when prosecutors  ask that they be detained,  ""[i]n  practice,  judges  almost never  defy the prosecution  by setting  low bail  when a crime  involves  sex or violence"" (p. 37).  That is because most state judges are  elected,  and they do not want to be deemed  responsible if someone  released  pretrial commits  a crime that attracts  media  attention.  And  as  Bazelon  notes,  ""[a] judge  who lets  out  a  defendant  over  the objections  of a prosecutor  is  especially  vulnerable""  (p. 37). So  judges  normally  agree  to  whatever  bail  amount  a  prosecutor  requests (p. 39).  Courts  typically  let prosecutors  use  evidence  obtained  by  the police even when  there  are  serious  doubts  that  evidence  was  legally  obtained  because judges tend to believe  the police's  version  of events  (p. 29).  They fail  to enforce prosecutors'  constitutional  obligation  to  turn  over  exculpatory  evidence by finding most violations harmless (p.  105).",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

"With this  kind of power,  it is  easy to  see why Bazelon  believes  ""prosecutors  also  hold  the  key  to  change""  (p. xxvii).  In  her  view,  prosecutors  ""can protect  against  convicting  the  innocent.  They  can  guard  against  racial  bias. They can curtail  mass incarceration""  (p. xxvii). Because if prosecutors  reform their  pretrial-detention  requests,  charging  policies,  and  sentencing  recommendations,  criminal  justice  could  look  very  different.  This  has  been  the spark behind  the remarkably  successful  movement  to  transform  district  attorney elections  and place  reformers  in posts traditionally  held by tough-oncrime  prosecutors. 9 These  traditional prosecutors  were often unresponsive to concerns  that  they  were  putting  too  many  young  men, and  particularly young men  of color,  in  prison,  while  at  the  same  time  failing  to  prosecute cases  of police abuse  and violence  against citizens  (pp. 77-78).",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Many of the prosecutors  elected  on a  progressive platform  have reduced incarceration  in  their  jurisdictions.  For  example,  Larry  Krasner  reduced  the jail  population  in Philadelphia  by 30  percent in  his first year  in office. 10 Kim Foxx has  sought to lower  the  population  in  the  Cook  County jail by having her prosecutors  recommend  I-Bonds, which allow a  person to be  released  on their  own recognizance  pending  trial,  in cases  where  there  is  no  prior violent  criminal  history,  the  current  offense  is  a  misdemeanor  or  low-level  felony,  and  there  are  no  other  risk factors  suggesting  a  danger  to  the  community  or  a  failure  to  appear  for court.""",cover_heinonline,Barkow - 2020 - Can Prosecutors End Mass Incarceration 2020 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This Symposium  comes  at a critical juncture for America's prosecutors. One  important question-""Is there room  for a  new  kind of prosecutor?""has already been answered. Self-styled ""progressive prosecutors"" are flourishing  in jurisdictions across the country.  The question remains whether the  progressive  prosecutor movement  will  have  a  lasting  impact and,  if so, what that impact will be.  One  way this question will  be answered  is through the  movement's  influence  on the many  prosecutors  who  are  open  to  reform but unlikely  to adopt the ""progressive"" label  or accompanying  rhetoric.",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Expanding the Reach of Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Essay explores this  theme  by discussing, first, the rise of progressive  prosecution  and,  second,  how  this  movement's  initial  success can stimulate the long-overdue development of  a  generally applicable, normative  theory of the prosecutor's role.  It suggests  a conceptualization  of the  American prosecutor as a caretaker for the criminal justice  system,  who should  default  to  lenience when  that  system  becomes so congested and punitive that it cannot  deliver on its constitutional ideals.",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Expanding the Reach of Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

District  attorney  races  offer  a  rare  bargain  in  the  money-fueled  arms race  of  American  politics. District attorney elections  are characterized  by low voter interest. 3 Candidates  regularly run unopposed. 4 In some jurisdictions it is difficult to find anyone  willing to take the job. This plays to two strengths of  progressive  reformers: (1) a  passionate voter  base and  (2)  access  to campaign financing  from  wealthy  donors  like George Soros.'

"Apart from  the political  advantages  noted  in  the  preceding  paragraph, there  are  structural  reasons  reformers  target district attorneys,  as  opposed to judges,  police,  or  legislators.  District  attorneys  have  no boss.  They  answer solely to the  voters.  This  means that  District Attorneys  do  not need to clear their  policies  with  other  officials. They  can  act  unilaterally. By  contrast, conservative  and progressive legislators must often compromise to pass laws. Trial courts,  in  turn,  are  checked  by  appellate courts,  which  themselves require  compromise  in order to generate  a controlling  opinion.  Police  chiefs, another  powerful  source of reform,  are similar  to  district  attorneys  with respect to  local  independence.

## Theories  of Prosecution,cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"For decades,  legal  commentators  sounded the  alarm  about the tremendous  power wielded by prosecutors. Scholars went so  far as to identify  uncurbed  prosecutorial discretion  as  the primary  source  of  the criminal justice  system's many  flaws. Over  the  past  two  years, however,  the conversation  shifted.  With  the emergence of  a new wave of  ""progressive prosecutors,"" scholars  increasingly  hail  broad prosecutorial discretion  as  a promising mechanism for  criminal justice reform.",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The abrupt  shift  from decrying to embracing  prosecutorial power highlights a curious void at the  center of criminal  justice thought. There is no widely accepted  normative  theory of  the prosecutorial role. As  a result, prosecutors are viewed  as the criminal  justice system's free agents, deploying the  powers of  their  offices as they see  fit to serve constituents,  public  safety,  or, most broadly, the cause ofjustice.",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article uses the rapidly  shifting views about  prosecutors  to explore normative theories of  prosecution: What should  prosecutors be doing? It highlights  the emptiness of  the current ""do  justice""  model and  proposes an alternative ""servant-of-the-law"" theory of prosecutorial  behavior that could  place real constraints  on prosecutorial  excess.  It also explores ways in which a servant-of-thelaw model could, perhaps  counterintuitively, contribute  much-needed theoretical  grounding  to the progressive  prosecution  movement.",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Scholars  view  prosecutors as ""the most powerful  officials  in the criminal justice system,""' and blame  them  for ""[m]uch  of what is  wrong with American criminal justice."" 2 But there is  typically something  missing  from  the accounts. An  abundant literature highlights  the failings  of the nation's prosecutors. 3  Yet when  it comes  to setting out principles to govern  how prosecutors should act, the commentary offers  only platitudes. 4 A  1935  Supreme  Court opinion  famously reminds prosecutors  that it is  their special duty to  ensure  ""that  justice  shall  be done."" 5 After  that, the  consensus crumbles. Despite  all  the  attention paid  to prosecutors  in recent years,  the  primary guidance  on the prosecutorial function remains  a timeworn Rorschach test. 6",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Commentators  traditionally viewed the absence of concrete rules governing prosecutorial  discretion as a blight on the criminal justice landscape, contributing to overly punitive and often racist criminal  justice outcomes. 7 Yet in recent years, with  the  ascension  of unapologetically  ""progressive  prosecutors,""  commentary on  prosecutorial  power  developed  a  new  dimension. 8 In  2017,  for  example, newly  elected Orlando District Attorney Aramis Ayala announced that her office would  no  longer  seek  the  death  penalty.'  Over  one  hundred  prominent  law professors and  public  officials signed  an open  letter  of  support. Efforts  to override Ayala's decision, they wrote, threatened prosecutors' ""extremely  broad discretion  to  decide  when,  and  how,  to  prosecute""  and  ""compromise[d] the prosecutorial  independence  upon which the criminal justice system  depends."" 0 Around the same time,  Baltimore's chief  prosecutor,  Marilyn Mosby, became  a ""proxy for a nation reeling  with outrage and disbelief' when she swiftly  initiated ultimately  unsuccessful  criminal  charges  against  six police  officers  involved  in the  death  of Freddie  Gray.""  In  a  ""clip that  would  echo  across  the  country,"" Mosby  explained  to  supporters,  ""I have  heard  your  calls  for  'no  justice,  no",cover_heinonline,Bellin - 2020 - Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Courts  throughout the  country have long  recognized  that prosecutors are  vested with  broad  discretionary powers. United States v.  Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.1965); Moses v. Kennedy, 219 F.  Supp.  762 (D.D.C.1963);Pugach v.  Klein,, 193 F.Supp.  630 (D.D.C. 1961); Williams  v.  Cave, 138 Kan. 586,  27 P.2d  272 (S.Ct.  1933); Hassan  v. Magistrates Court, 20  Misc.  509,  191  N.Y.S.2d 238  (S.Ct.1959). Prosecutorial discretion is  deeply  imbedded in  our  history and was rooted  in  the  common law of England long  before  the  birth of  this nation. See LaFave, The  Prosecutor's Discretion in  The United States, 18 Am.J. Comp.L. 532 (1970).",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In New  Jersey, every  prosecutor is  charged  by statute with  the  duty  ""to  use  all reasonable and lawful  diligence for  the  detection, arrest, indictment and conviction of offenders against the  law.""  N.J.S.A.2A: 158-5.  Nevertheless, our  courts have explicitly recognized  that prosecution of  criminal cases  is  not  a ministerial function and that a ""county  prosecutor within  the  orbit of  his  discretion inevitably has  various choices of action  and even of inaction."" State v. Winne, 12 N.J. 152,  174 (1953).  It  is  thus incumbent upon  prosecutorial. authorities to exercise  discretion based upon  their ""judgment  and conscience . . . in  accordance with  established principles of  law."" State v. LaVien, 44  N.J.  323,  327 (1965).",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Despite  the  almost  universal acceptance of  the  settled principle that prosecutors possess  broad discretionary powers,  the  boundaries of  such authority are  vague and remain  largely undefined. No one  would dispute the  fact that the  exercise of  discretion implies  ""conscientious judgment, not  arbitrary action"" and  that a prosecutor's range  of choices, not  unlike a judge's, depends  upon the  ""particular circumstances of  the  case."" State v.  Shiren, 9 N.J.  445,  452 (1952). See  also Abrams, Internal Policy: Guiding the Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion, 19 U.C.L.A.  L.  Rev.1 (1971); Miller, Prosecution: The Decision  To  Charge a Suspect  With a Crime, Chap. 20  (1970).  So too,  it is axiomatic that discretion must be exercised ""fairly, wisely, and  with  skill and reason."" State v.  LeVien,  supra, at  327.  Clearly, a prosecutor is  duty-bound  to  perform  his statutory responsibilities in  ""good faith"" and  personal gain  or  favoritism are  to  play  no part in  decision-making. State v. Winne,  supra at  162, 163.  But  there is  little agreement among  legal  authorities with respect  to the  nature  and extent  of a prosecutor's discretionary powers  beyond these  few broad  generalizations. Equally  disturbing is  the paucity of  written material relating to  this important subject of  concern.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Decision-making  occurs at every stage  of a  criminal  prosecution. A county prosecutor has ""an obligation to  detect and  arrest as  well  as  to  obtain indictments and prosecute  them."" Id. at 174. He  is  statutorily required  ""to  investigate suspicious situations and determine  the  facts in  the  process of  detecting and  arresting, especially when he receives information that makes it reasonably probable that the  law  has  been violated."" Ibid. Most  problems relating to prosecutorial discretion concern the alternative courses of action left  to a  prosecutor  after  investigation has been completed. It is  at  this stage  of  the  proceedings when a  prosecutor is  confronted with the  decision as  to whether  he  must  seek  an  indictment and,  if so,  whether  he  must  then determine the  nature of  the  offense to  be charged.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Examination  of  cases  and other sources leads  to  the  conclusion that a  prosecutor is  vested  with  broad  discretionary powers  in  determining whether  to  prosecute once an investigation has been  completed.  See, e.g.,  A.B.A. Project on Standards, ""The Prosecution Function  and The Defense Function,""  §3.4  (Tent.Draft 1971).  Before consideration of  the  factors which might  be useful in channeling this discretion, it would be  well  to  discuss the  limitations which bind  a  prosecutor's choice  of  action.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"As  with  all  discretionary powers,  those  of  a prosecutor are  subject to  possible abuse.  The discretion  ot  to  prosecute is  therefore limited at  the  extreme  where  it becomes no longer  a  proper  exercise of  authority, but rather a  criminal abuse  of  public office, e.g., misconduct. As previously noted, the  language of  N.J.S.A.2A: 158-5 would appear  to  mandate prosecution in  every  possible instance. However, the  experience of other jurisdictions with  similarly worded acts discloses that the  exercise of  discretion is not  automatically precluded. See e.g., Comment; 42 So.Cal. L.  Rev.  519 (1969). In  any event, our  statute was construed to  permit  a reasoned  decision to  refuse to  prosecute under  limited circumstances in State v.  Winne,  supra.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"There,  a county  prosecutor was indicted for  misconduct  in office, specifically nonfeasance. He  was charged  in 16 counts with  having  knowledge of  the  operation of disorderly houses  where gambling  operations were maintained. It  was alleged  that he unlawfully and willfully neglected  to  perform  his  duty  to  use all proper  and lawful means to  detect, arrest, indict, and convict those responsible, despite the  fact  that he had sufficient men  and resources to  do so.  In  the  final three counts of  the  indictment, the  defendant was charged  with  unlawfully and  willfully failing to  use  lawful  means at his  disposal to  detect, arrest and prosecute certain police officials about  whom  he had received reports of  corruption. Id. at  162, 163.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Our Supreme Court  squarely  confronted the  issue  whether  a corrupt agreement had to  be alleged and  proven  to  support a charge  of  nonfeasance and,  if not, whether  a quasi-judicial officer, such  as  a county  prosecutor, could  be liable for nonfeasance  for failure to  perform  discretionary acts. The Court  concluded  that nonfeasance  required mens rea but  not  a corrupt motive. In  other words,  nonfeasance was alleged where it was said  that the  defendant  ""willfully or  corruptly"" refused to  fulfill his duties. It was not  necessary  that some motive  of  personal gain  or  favoritism be shown.  It was enough that the  refusal was willful and  for no valid reason, e.g., in  bad faith. The Court  agreed that  the  prosecutor was  a quasi-judicial officer endowed  with discretion, but  found that a standard of  good faith would not  unduly  obstruct him in  the  performance of  his office. Rather,  the Court  noted that  the  publichad a right  to expect  care, skill, diligence, reason  and  judgment  by  a prosecutor.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The indictment in Winne set  forth a continuous course  of  inaction in  the  face  of flagrant and wide-spread gambling  operations. No  acceptable reason appeared  why  the defendant had not  investigated further whether  the  law was being  violated and,  if so, by whom.  In  fact, the  conduct  of  the  defendant appeared  to  be  wrongful  not  because he exercised discretion but  because  he never  considered the  matter at  all. Unaffected by the  Court's decision is  the  principle that  inaction is  not  unlawful  where it is  the product  of  a sound,  conscientious exercise of  discretion. See Note, Nonfeasance: A Threat to  the  Prosecutor's Discretion, 30 Ind. L. Rev.  74  (1955).",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The idea  that a prosecutor must adhere  to  a standard of  good faith in  exercising the  powers of  his  office and must use all  lawful  and reasonable diligence to  detect, arrest, prosecute  and  convict  violators was  thought  by  some  to have effectively destroyed prosecutorial discretion not  to  prosecute where evidence  of  guilt was clear. See e.g., Ferguson, Formulation of Enforcement  Policy: An  Anatomy  of the Prosecutor's Discretion Prior to  Accusation, Rutgers L.  Rev.  507 (1957); Note,  30 Ind. L. Rev. 74 (1955). Many  have suggested  that a prosecutor must  always  proceed  where probable cause  exists to  believe a conviction can be  obtained. A careful reading of  the Court's decision in Winne,  supra, reveals that such  fears are  groundless.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In Winne the  Court  quoted  extensively from the  Supreme Court of  Missouri's decision in State ex rel. McKittrick v. Wallach, 353 Mo. 312, 182 N.W.2d 313,  318-19 (S.Ct. 1944), as  to  the  nature of  the  prosecutor's discretion. The language  of  that court goes  far to  negate  that a prosecutor cannot  properly refuse to  prosecute where  guilt is clear. Yet more explicit language  appears  later in Winne where our Supreme  Court observed  that:",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"""There are  undoubtedly  many  instances when  a refusal in  good faith to  prosecute after due investigation would lack  the  element of  'willfulness but  where he willfully refuses to  act, i.e., without just cause  or  excuse, he is  guilty of  breach  of  duty  rendering him liable  to indictment. The  distinction between the exercise of discretion in  good faith and a willful failure to  act  is to  be  judged by his  conduct  in  the  light of  all the  facts and circumstances. A county  prosecutor within  the  orbit of  his  discretion inevitably has various  choices  of  action  and even of  inaction. This discretion applies as  much  to  the  seeking of  indictments from the  grand  jury as it  does from prosecuting or recommending a nolle prosequi after the  indictment has  been found, but  he  must at  all times  act in good faith and exercise all  reasonable and lawful  diligence in every  phase  of  his work."" Id. at  174.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Clearly, the  Court  did  not  intend to  divest a prosecutor of  the  choice  to  prosecute or not  to  prosecute in  a given set  of  circumstances. Neither the  statutory duty  nor  the standard of  good faith were thought to  serve  as  barriers to  such  a decision. Only  where no reasonable justification appears  for  a prosecutor's continued  failure to  act in  the face  of  information as to  serious violations does  the  possibility of  criminal sanctions arise. Suffice it to  say  that an  honest  prosecutor who bases  a  decision not  to  prosecute on relevant and appropriate factors has little to fear  in the way  of  justifying his conduct  under  a good faith standard.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Recent  cases  support the  view  that a  prosecutor may refuse to  present a  matter to a grand  jury  even when there exists probable cause  to  believe that a criminal offense has  been committed.  While  these  decisions concern a  prosecutor's discretion in determining which of  several  charges  should be brought  against an offender, their applicability to  the  issue whether  a  prosecutor may refuse to  prosecute at  all admits  of no doubt.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In State v.  Hampton, 61  N.J.  250 (1972),  our  Supreme Court  faced  the  problem whether  a certain set  of  facts warranted  prosecution for kidnapping with  its attendant thirty year  minimum  sentence. In  that case, the  evidence  showed that the  defendant had forced  the  victim to  drive  him around  town for over  an hour  at  gun point and so frightened her  that she  attempted to  flee  and was thereafter shot. The Court  held  that the  kidnapping charge  could  be brought and the  conviction was upheld. However, it made  abundantly  clear  that  the prosecutor  had  not only the power, but the responsibility not to prosecute  on  such serious  charges  where the facts, though technically sufficient, do  not  warrant prosecution. The Court  stated:",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"""Ordinarily the  decision as to  whether  the  asportation of  a  victim is  sufficient to  indicate commission of  the  separate and distinct crime  of  kidnapping in  addition to  the  basic crime  undertaken by a  defendant  to warrant prosecution  as  such, rests  with the discretion of  the  prosecutor in  the  first instance. As Judge  Gaulkin said  in State v.  Johnson, supra, 'the severe  penalty commanded  by the  statute for  kidnapping  imposes upon the  prosecutor a moral obligation not  to  seek  an indictment therefore unless  the  crime fairly appears  and  warrants the  heavy  punishment.' "" Id. at  275.",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Similarly, in State v.  States, 44 N.J.  285 (1965),  the  defendant claimed  that his conduct  in pushing  a police  officer should  have been prosecuted  under a statute making assault on a police officer a high  misdemeanor and,  therefore, the  Municipal Court  was without jurisdiction to  convict him of  simple  assault and  battery. The Court rejected the  defendant's theory  in  language  which recognizes  that a prosecutor may make decisions which are  not  strictly a  function of  the  probability of  conviction. More specifically, the  Court  noted:",cover_heinonline,Bellin_2020_Theories of Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"""It  might also  be that  the  attack on  the  officer was  of  such inconsequential character that  the  prosecuting authority would not  feel  justified in  charging  the  more serious offense. Relevant practical factors as well  as consideration of  fair play,  and the reasonable expectations of  the  Legislature and the  public relating to  control of  the  conduct  proscribed, are  permitted to  influence the  discretion of  the  proper  authority as to the course  to  be followed.""

Most commentators  favor more external regulation  by  legislatures,  judges, or bar  authorities.  Neither  across-the-board  legislation  nor  ex post review of individual  cases has proven to be effective,  however.

Leaders could do  more to  develop  office  cultures,  norms,  and ideals that value more than maximizing conviction statistics. Hierarchical  office structures and internal procedural and substantive office  policies could promote deliberation, give  fair  notice,  and increase  consistency.  Hiring, training, promotion, and tenure practices could  better shape  prosecutors and their behavior.

"Few of these  forces  meaningfully  constrain  prosecutors. They follow  no Administrative  Procedure Act,  nor do  they operate  in  the  sunshine  of public  disclosure. While  in  theory  the  separation  of powers should  check  prosecutors,  in  practice  it  does not. 3 Legislatures  keep giving  prosecutors  more  power, not  less, by  expanding  overlapping criminal statutes and  giving  prosecutors  more  plea-bargaining tools. 4 Judges  largely  avoid  interfering  with  prosecutorial  decisions. They reason that juries will  ultimately check charges,  even  though few  cases make  it  to jury trials  in  a world  of guilty  pleas. Governors  and  Presidents exercise  little  or no control  over line prosecutors' decisions.",cover_heinonline,Bibas - 2008 - Prosecutorial Regulation versus Prosecutorial Accountability.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  theory,  prosecutors  are  beholden  to  the  public  interest  or justice. These  concepts,  however,  are  so  diffuse  and  elastic  that they  do not constrain prosecutors  much,  certainly not in  the way  that an identifiable  client would.  As  I  have  argued  elsewhere,  prosecution  is  a lowvisibility  process  about which  the  public  has poor information  and  little right to participate. 5 District  attorneys' electoral  contests are  rarely measured assessments of a prosecutor's overall  performance. At best, campaign  issues  boil  down to  boasts  about  conviction  rates, a  few high-profile  cases,  and  maybe  a  scandal. The  advantages  of incumbency  and  name  recognition  are  also  huge. Moreover,  a  district  attorney's subordinates  are  unelected  and  often  operate  with  remarkably little oversight.",cover_heinonline,Bibas - 2008 - Prosecutorial Regulation versus Prosecutorial Accountability.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The resulting  dangers can be  enormous. While prosecutorial  discretion  is  ""at the  heart of the  State's criminal justice  system,""  prosecutors' ""power to be lenient  [also] is  the  power to  discriminate."" 6 Prosecutors  have  great  leeway  to abuse  their powers  and  indulge their  selfinterests, biases,  or  arbitrariness. As  I  have  argued  elsewhere,  prosecutors  have  personal  and  sometimes  financial  incentives  to  lighten",cover_heinonline,Bibas - 2008 - Prosecutorial Regulation versus Prosecutorial Accountability.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Ferguson has come  to  symbolize  a  widespread sense  that there  is  a crisis in American criminal  justice. This Article describes  various articulations  of what the problems  are and  poses the question of  whether law is capable of  fixing these problems. I  consider  the question theoretically by looking at claims that critical race theorists have made  about law and race. Using Supreme Court cases as examples, I  demonstrate how  some of the  ""problems"" described in the  U.S. Justice Department's  Ferguson report,  like police violence and widespread arrests  of  African-Americans for petty offenses, are not only legal, but integral features of  policing and punishment in the  United States. They  are how the system  is supposed to work.  The  conservatives on  the  Court are  aware, and intend, that the expansive  powers  they grant the  police  will  be  exercised  primarily against  African-American men.  I  then  consider the  question of reform using  empirical analysis  of one  of the  most popular legal  remedies: ""pattern  or practice"" investigations by  the  U.S.  Department of Justice. Some  reforms are stopgap measures that provide limited help but  fail to bring about the  transformation  demanded by  the  strongest articulations of the crisis.  In fact, in some ways,  reform efforts  impede transformation. I  conclude by  imagining the  wholesale transformation necessary to fix the kinds of  problems articulated by  the Movement  for Black Lives.",cover_heinonline,Butler - 2019 - The system is working the way it is supposed to the limits of criminal justice reform.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Well,  if  one  really wishes  to  know  how justice is administered in a  country, one  does not question the policemen, the  lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the  middle class. One goes to  the unprotected-those,  precisely, who  need the  law's protection the  most!-and listens to  their testimony. Ask any Mexican,  any Puerto Rican, any  black man,  any poor person-ask the wretched how  they fare in  the halls of justice, and then  you  will  know, not whether or not the  country is just, but whether or not  it  has any  love for justice,  or any concept  of it.",cover_heinonline,Butler - 2019 - The system is working the way it is supposed to the limits of criminal justice reform.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Ferguson  police  charged  a  man  named  ""Michael"" with  ""Making a  False Declaration"" because  he  told  them  his  name  was  ""Mike."" Michael  had  been playing  basketball  in  a  public  park  and  went  to  his  car  to  cool  off. The  police approached him and, for no  apparent reason,  accused  him of being a  pedophile. They  requested  his  consent  to  search  his  car  and  Michael,  citing  his  constitutional  rights,  declined.  At  that  point,  Michael  was  arrested,  reportedly  at  gunpoint.  In  addition  to  ""making  a  false  declaration,""  the  police  charged  Michael with  seven  other  minor offenses,  including  not wearing  a  seat belt.

"I  will  argue  that  despite  his  careful  and  important  account,  Pasquale's ""black  box society""  frame lends itself to  a misdiagnosis of the  discrimination problem likely to  lie in algorithmic  decisionmaking.  This misdiagnosis  leads to  the wrong prescription-namely,  an often-quixotic  search for algorithmic transparency. 8 Furthermore,  the  transparency that  Pasquale's argument can be  read  to  support  is  the  wrong  sort: a  transparency in  the  design of  the algorithm.  (I  should  make clear  that Pasquale  himself is  more nuanced,  calling for a  discussion  of the kinds of transparency we  should demand;  he asks: ""How much  does the black box firm have to reveal?  To whom must it reveal it?  And  how  fast . . . ?"" (p.  142).)  Even  a  transparent,  facially  neutral  algorithm  can  still produce  discriminatory  results. 9 What we need instead  is  a transparency  of inputs and  results, which  allows  us to see that the algorithm is",cover_heinonline,Chander - 2016 - The Racist Algorithm 2017 Survey of Books Related to the Law Reviews.pdf,pdf_first_page

"generating discriminatory impact. If  we  know  that  the results  of  an algorithm  are  systematically  discriminatory,  then we  know  enough to  seek  to redesign  the  algorithm or to  distrust its  results.  The  distinction  is similar  to the  evidentiary  difference  between  demonstrating  disparate  treatment  and demonstrating  disparate  impact. 0 My central  claim  is  this: if we  believe  that the  real-world facts,  on which  algorithms are  trained and  operate, are  deeply suffused  with  invidious  discrimination,  then  our  prescription  to  the  problem of racist  or sexist""  algorithms  is algorithmic  affirmative action. Thus,  the problem is  not the  black  box, which  is  often  more  neutral  than the  human decisionmaker  it replaces,  but  the real  world  on which  it operates.

"This Article theorizes and reimagines the place of courts in the contemporary  struggle  for the abolition  of  racialized punitive systems of legal control and exploitation. In the spring  and summer of  2020, the killings of  George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many other Black and Indigenous people sparked continuous protests against racist police  violence and  other  forms of  oppression.  Meanwhile, abolitionist organizers and scholars have  long  critiqued the prison-industrial complex, or the constellation  of  corporations,  media entities, governmental actors, and racist and capitalist ideologies that have driven mass incarceration.  But between the police and the prison cell sits the criminal  court. Criminal  courts  are the legal  pathway  from an arrest  to a  prison  sentence, with myriad  systems of  control  in between, including ones  branded as  ""off-ramps.""  We  cannot understand the present  crisis  without understanding  how the criminal  courts not only function  to  legitimate  police and  funnel people into carceral  spaces but also contribute  their  own unique  forms of  violence, social  control, and exploitation. These mechanisms reveal the machinations  of  mass criminalization and  the injustices  operating  between the  police encounter and the prison cell.  Our central  argument is that courts with  a  focus  here  on criminal trial courts and the group of actors within  them function  as  an  unjust  social institution.  We  should therefore work toward  abolishing  criminal  courts and replacing  them with other institutions that  do not inherently  legitimate  police,  rely on jails  and prisons,  or  operate  as  tools  of  racial and  economic oppression.",cover_heinonline,Clair and Woog - 2022 - Courts and the Abolition Movement.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Drawing on  legal scholarship and empirical social scientific research, Part  I describes injustices  perpetrated  by criminal  courts, detailing  their  role  in  the  present crisis of mass  criminalization through legal doctrine,  racialized  social control and violence,  and economic exploitation. Part  II describes the  contemporary  abolition movement,  briefly laying out its genesis and three guiding  principles typically considered  in  relation to policing and prisons: (1) power shifting,  (2)  defunding and reinvesting, and (3)  transformation.  Part III  explores how  these principles could operate in  relation to  the courts, drawing  on analysis  of  existing  grassroots  efforts and  offering new possibilities.  In the short  term, non-reformist  reforms could  make criminal  courts a venue  to unmask, and therefore aid in dismantling, police  and prisons.  Such  reforms  could complement  the  broader abolition  movement  and reduce  the  churn  of people  through  the criminal  legal  system.  Ultimately, the goal  is to abolish  criminal  courts as sites of coercion, violence,  and exploitation and to replace them with  other social institutions, such  as  community-based restorative justice  and peacemaking programs,  while  investing  in  the  robust provision  of  social,  political, and  economic resources  in marginalized communities.",cover_heinonline,Clair and Woog - 2022 - Courts and the Abolition Movement.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The American criminal justice system is a system of pleas. Few who know it well think it is working. And yet, identifying plausible strategies for law reform proves challenging, given the widely held scholarly assumption that plea bargaining operates 'beyond the shadow of the law.' That assumption holds true with respect to substantive and constitutional criminal law-the two most studied bodies of law in the criminal justice system-neither of  which  significantly  regulates  prosecutorial  power.  The assumption is misguided, however, insofar as it fails to account for a third body of law-the subconstitutional law of criminal procedure-that regulates and often establishes the very mechanisms by which prosecutorial plea bargaining power is both generated and deployed.",cover_jstor,Crespo - 2018 - The hidden law of plea bargaining.pdf,pdf_first_page
"These hidden regulatory levers are neither theoretical nor abstract. Rather, they exist in strikingly varied forms across our pluralist criminal justice system. This Article excavates these unexamined legal frameworks, conceptualizes  their  regulatory  potential,  highlights  their  heterogeneity across  jurisdictions,  and  exposes  the  institutional  actors  most  frequently responsible for their content. In so doing, it opens up not only new scholarly terrain but also new potential pathways to criminal justice reform.",cover_jstor,Crespo - 2018 - The hidden law of plea bargaining.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Plea bargaining, we are told, is lawless. It 'evolved in the unregulated interstices of our criminal justice system.' 1 And it continues to be driven not by law but by power-the vast, unregulated power of prosecutors. 2  As plea bargaining  scholars  have  long  recounted,  prosecutors'  ability  to  threaten inflated sentences, combined with their power to trade those sentences away for pleas of guilt, allows them to control 'who goes to prison and for how long.' 3 As for law, it has abandoned, on this account, its most basic function: channeling prosecutorial power through regulatory constraints. 4 Substantive criminal law, after all, now penalizes so much conduct, so severely, and so",cover_jstor,Crespo - 2018 - The hidden law of plea bargaining.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Take, for example, charge bargaining, the primary mechanism by which prosecutors  control  defendants'  sentencing  exposure,  and  with  it  the  socalled  trial  penalties  defendants  face  if  they  dare  refuse  a  prosecutor's invitation  to  plead  guilty.  Long  criticized  as  an  illicit  form  of  coercion, charge bargaining presents a conundrum under the traditional scholarly account: Given the breadth and depth of substantive criminal law, charge bargaining is routinely diagnosed as a major driver of plea bargaining's pathology; 11 but  given  prosecutors'  constitutional  authority-indeed,  their responsibility-to select the charges a defendant will face, it is also seen as  an  inevitable  feature  of  criminal  law's  administration. 12 If  one  looks beyond substantive and constitutional criminal law, however, charge bargaining's power dynamics become far more complex, for the essential particulars of  the  practice-ranging from the number of charges the prosecutor can file,  to  their  severity,  to  their  relationship  to  the  defendant's  sentencing exposure,  to  the  ease  with  which  they  can  be  traded  away-all  directly impact just how much leverage the prosecutor truly has. And crucially, those particulars are in turn dictated by the subconstitutional procedural law of the states-an interlocking set of legal frameworks that comprises the law of joinder and severance, the law of preclusion, the law of cumulative sentencing,  the  law  of  pretrial  charge  review,  the  law  of  dismissal  and amendment, and the law of lesser offenses. 13",cover_jstor,Crespo - 2018 - The hidden law of plea bargaining.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Prosecutors  are  the  most  powerful  officials  in  the  criminal justice system. At least ninety  percent  of all  criminal  cases  are  prosecuted  on the  state level,  and in  all but five jurisdictions, the  chief prosecutor  (also known  as the district  attorney)  is  an elected  official. Most district  attorneys  run unopposed  and serve for decades. However,  in recent  years, a number of incumbent district attorneys have been challenged and defeated by individuals who pledged to use their power  and discretion to reduce the  incarceration  rate  and eliminate  unwarranted  racial disparities  in the criminal justice  system.  These  so-called ""progressive  prosecutors""  have enjoyed  some modest  successes, but  many have  faced challenges-from within  and  outside  of their  offices. This Article  discusses  some  of these successes  and challenges  and  proposes guidelines  to assist newly-elected district  attorneys  who  are committed  to criminal justice reform.",cover_heinonline,Davis - 2019 - Reimagining Prosecution A Growing Progressive Movement.pdf,pdf_first_page

Can  progressive  prosecutors  make  significant progress  towards the  goals  of eliminating mass incarceration  and unwarranted racial disparities?  What are the factors  that impact their ability to affect  change  and  how can those factors be managed?",cover_heinonline,Davis - 2019 - Reimagining Prosecution A Growing Progressive Movement.pdf,pdf_first_page
Part  I  briefly  describes  and  discusses  how  prosecutors  contribute to  mass incarceration  and racial disparities  in the criminal justice system. Part II  discusses the recent movement  of elected progressive  prosecutors with  a  focus  on  three  prosecutor  offices  that  have  implemented  policies  to  reduce  the  jail  and  prison  population. Part  III  examines  some of  the  internal  and  external  challenges  faced  by  prosecutors  who  have implemented  progressive  policies. Part IV  discusses  factors  that  affect a  prosecutor's  ability  to  implement  reforms  and  proposes  guidelines for  elected  prosecutors  who  are  committed to  transforming  the  existing model of prosecution.,cover_heinonline,Davis - 2019 - Reimagining Prosecution A Growing Progressive Movement.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Despite  over  two decades of  reform,  fundamental  failures persist in the justice system's response  to  domestic  violence. 2 Society  now  widely  accepts elimination of  intrafamily abuse  as  a  crucial goal, and  it has  been  illegal in  most states since  the late  nineteenth century. 3 But the  problem remains one of epidemic  proportions. As  documented in Part I of  this  Article, battering by husbands, ex-husbands, or  lovers is  the  single largest cause  of  injury to  women 4 in the  United States, 5 and accounts  for  approximately thirty percent  of  all murders of  women. 6  Physical aggression occurs  in  at  least one out of  four marriages, and comparable  rates exist among  couples  who  are  living together, engaged,  or  dating.'

"Police officers in the United  States have killed over 1000 civilians each  year since  2013. The constitutional landscape  that  regulates  these  encounters defaults to the  judgments of  the reasonable police officer at  the time of  a civilian encounter based  on the officer's  assessment  of  whether threats to their  safety or the safety of  others requires  deadly  force. As many of  these killings have begun to  occur under similar circumstances, scholars have  renewed a contentious debate on  whether police disproportionately  use deadly force against  African Americans and  other  nonwhite civilians  and whether such killings reflect racial bias.  We  analyze data on 3933 killings to examine this intersection of  race  and reasonableness  in  police killings. First, we describe  the objective circumstances and interactions  of  police killings and map those event characteristics  to  the elements of  reasonableness  articulated  in case law. Second,  we assess whether inherently vague constitutional  regulation  of lethal  force is applied  differently by  officers depending on the civilian's  race, giving rise to  a disproportionate rate of deaths among racial  and ethnic minority groups.  We  then  assess the prospects  for  remediation  of  racialized police killings  by testing  the effects of  an existing evidence-based training curricula designed to  reduce police  use  of deadly  force towards  persons experiencing  mental illness.",cover_heinonline,Fagan and Campbell - 2020 - Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings Symposium Beyond Bad Apples Exploring the Legal Determi.pdf,pdf_first_page
"We  find  that, across several  circumstances of police  killings  and their objective  reasonableness, Black suspects are more  than twice  as likely  to  be killed by police than are  persons of other racial  or ethnic groups; even  when there are  no other obvious circumstances  during  the encounter  that would  make the use of  deadly  force reasonable.  Police  killings ofLatinx civilians  are  higher compared to  whites  and other racial or ethnic groups in  some but not  all circumstances.  We find no  evidence that enhanced  police training  focused on mental health  crises  can reduce  the incidence  offatal  police shootings  ofpersons in  mental  health crisis or racial and ethnic disparities generally in  police",cover_heinonline,Fagan and Campbell - 2020 - Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings Symposium Beyond Bad Apples Exploring the Legal Determi.pdf,pdf_first_page

"killings. Our  findings suggest  that the standards in constitutional case law  fail to  anticipate  the  circumstances of  fatal police shootings  and are therefore seemingly irrelevant  in  preventing racial  disparities in  police fatal police shootings. In light of this constitutional landscape, we argue that the ineffectiveness  of enhanced police training  to  reduce  shootings  overall  and racial  disparity within these  shootings may reflect the  absence of  race-specific components in  their  curricula. We suggest that the addition  of training components  that specifically address the  role of  race in officers 'perceptions  of risk and  their  decision-making in potentially dangerous interactions  with citizens  may remediate  both the incidence ofpolice shootings and their apparent racial and ethnic disparity.",cover_heinonline,Fagan and Campbell - 2020 - Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings Symposium Beyond Bad Apples Exploring the Legal Determi.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Of all the agencies of executive  government, those that police-that  employ force and  engage  in  surveillance-are the  most  threatening to the  liberties  of  the American people. Yet,  they are the least regulated.  Two  core  requisites of  American constitutionalism  are democratic accountability and adherence to the rule of law. Democratic  accountability  ensures that  policy choices are vetted in the public arena and have popular  support; the rule of law requires that those choices be constitutional  as well.  Legislative enactments governing  policing are few and far between. Although police departments  have internal  rules, these rules are rarely  made public or publicly debated. When  it comes to regulating  policing, we rely primarily  on ex post judicial review,  which  at best  ensures policing practices are  constitutional (though it often  fails on this score), and does  nothing to assure  democratic  accountability or sound policymaking.",cover_heinonline,Friedman and Ponomarenko - 2015 - Democratic Policing.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  Article  argues that it  is fundamentally  unacceptable  for policing to  remain aloof  from the  ordinary  processes of democratic  governance.  All police  practicessuch as use of drones or other surveillance equipment; SWAT,  Tasers, and other means of force;  checkpoint stops, administrative  inspections, and other  warrantless searches  and  seizures-should  be legislatively  authorized, subject  to  public rulemaking, or adopted and evaluated through  some  alternative  process that permits democratic input. In addition to spelling out the ways in which  the ordinary processes of governance can be  utilized  to  regulate policing, this Article fills  in substantial gaps in the existing literature  by  analyzing why  this has not  been  the case in the past,  and explaining how, within the existing  framework of administrative and constitutional  law, courts can motivate change. It also directs attention to the manifold questions that require  resolution in order  to move policing to a more democratically  accountable  footing.",cover_heinonline,Friedman and Ponomarenko - 2015 - Democratic Policing.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The progressive  prosecution  movement is one of  the most recent  efforts to reform the United States criminal justice system.  In this  Article, I analyze two assumptions that appear  to  be  guiding this movement.  The first is that prosecutors  have unilateral power to change the system.  The  second  is that those who bear  the biggest  burden  of  our current  system black Americans would be the primary  beneficiaries  of the decarceration proposals  advanced by  progressive prosecutors. I  argue  that  each  of  these  assumptions  is misguided. A  successful criminal  justice reform movement  must recognize the  contingent power of prosecutors and actively  seek  to  advance  racial justice  on  top  of  its  decarceration efforts. To  avoid  exacerbating the problems they  intend to  correct, reformists must  reexamine the principles underlying  the movement and the aims they expect to achieve.",cover_heinonline,Fryer - 2020 - Race_ Reform_ _ Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Whatever  else  one might think about  prosecutors, it is generally believed  that they hold the power to right the  wrongs  of our criminal justice system.  For  example,  while  discussing  a  political  action  committee  (PAC) created  to  help reform-minded  prosecutors  win elections,  the  activist  Shaun King commented:  ""No position in America,  no single individual has a bigger impact  on  the  criminal  justice  system-including  police  brutality,  but  the whole  crisis of  mass incarceration in  general-than  your  local district attorney . . . . They  are  the gatekeepers of  America's justice system."" Similarly, Danielle Sered, the executive director of the alternative-toincarceration program  Common  Justice, 2 noted: ""[m]ass incarceration is made  or broken  by a  bunch  of assistant  D.A.s  and  their supervisors  and the decisions  they  make  between  10:00  a.m.  and noon."" 3 And,  of  course,  one cannot  forget President  Obama's recommendation to those  dissatisfied with our  criminal  justice  system:  ""If you  are  really  concerned  about  how  the criminal justice  system treats  African-Americans,  the  best  way  to protest  is to  vote  .... Do  what  they  just  did  in  Philadelphia  and  Boston,  and  elect state's attorneys  and  district  attorneys  who  are  looking  at  issues  in  a new light.

"problems  of our  criminal  justice  system-such  as  mass  incarceration  and racial injustice-get prosecutors on your side. Since ""[t]he American prosecutor  rules  the  criminal  justice  system, exercising almost  limitless discretion and  virtually  absolute  power,"" 5 prosecutors  should  be  able  to unilaterally  correct its wrongs.  Or, as Professor Angela J.  Davis puts it: ""just as the power  and  discretion of  prosecutors have contributed to  mass incarceration  and  racial  disparities  in  the  criminal justice  system,  that  same power  and  discretion  may  be  used  to  institute  reforms  to  correct  these injustices.""6  Thus,  if we  are  really concerned  with  how the  criminal justice system treats  black people,  the  message  of what we  should do is  abundantly clear:  vote for the right prosecutors.",cover_heinonline,Fryer - 2020 - Race_ Reform_ _ Progressive Prosecution Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"If these  responses  to  the  oppressive  aspects  of our  system  of criminal justice strike  you as  too  simple  to be true, you  are right-they are  too simple to  be true.  Our penal  society  is shaped  by longstanding  stereotypes  of black criminality, 7 a  complex  relationship  between  racial  capitalism  and  carceral punishment,'  and  a general  desire  to  promote white  supremacy. 9 Thus, although  the recent movement  of ""progressive  prosecution""  is lauded  as the solution to  the flaws  of our system,  we  may be skeptical  about the potential reach of these prosecutors  who are  viewing issues in  a new  light.  This is not to  say  that  the  movement  isn't promising.  Yet  endorsements  encouraging those ""concerned  about  how  the  criminal  justice system  treats  AfricanAmericans"" 1 0 to  focus  their  energy  on  electing  prosecutors  should  be  met with  caution. The  first  thing  to  note  is  that  these  proposals  often  rely  on exaggerated  claims  about prosecutors' power  and naive  statements  about the potential  to limit such  power.

## The  Place  of the Prosecutor in Abolitionist  Praxis,cover_heinonline,Godsoe - 2022 - The Place of the Prosecutor in Abolitionist Praxis.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Progressive prosecutors have been widely hailed as the solution to mass incarceration.  This Article argues,  to the contrary,  that the legal  arm of law  enforcement  can  never be the  full answer  to its problems. While  scholars  critique police  and call  to  defund  and  dismantle  them, they  overlook prosecutors. Building  on the work  of abolitionist organizers  to theorize  and critique  progressive prosecutors,  the  Article asks  two  key questions  that  scholars  have  left  unanswered:  1)  Should the  system be  changed  from within?  and 2)  Can  the system  be  changed  from within? In  other words,  can reformers prosecute,  and can prosecutors  transform? I  answer the first question with cautious  optimism, concluding  that  prosecutors' institutional  power  and ethical mandate  to  ""do justice"" can be repurposed to start reversing decades  of  building  the carceral  state.  As to whether prosecutors  can  transform  the  system,  I  conclude  they  cannot. Transformation  entails  ceding power  to communities,  divesting  criminal  system resources,  and  investing  in  societal  supports that  actually  keep people  safe. Prosecutors'  essential  function  to  convict  and  punish  people cannot meaningfully  achieve  the dismantling of the carceral  state or the buildup  of alternatives. Three  pitfalls  in particular  impede them: exceptionalism,  net-widening,  and the hero complex.",cover_heinonline,Godsoe - 2022 - The Place of the Prosecutor in Abolitionist Praxis.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This inquiry is particularly timely as  the progressive  prosecutor  movement grows  and some of the first  wave  of them  face reelection. Despite  their rhetoric and reforms,  progressive  prosecutors  are not  shrinking  their  own  footprint. None  are  decreasing  their  budgets;  indeed,  most  are  asking for  more resources  to  ""help""  people. This Article  demonstrates  that these prosecutors  are not the magic  bullet. They are  at best  a half-measure  to  achieve  real  change,  and  at worst,  a  ""reformist reform""  which  risks  reentrenching  and  relegitimating  the  criminal  system  under  new  cover. I conclude by gesturing to the limits of all lawyers in fixing the carceral  monster they largely created and calling for greater  attention to grassroots,  bottom-up change.",cover_heinonline,Godsoe - 2022 - The Place of the Prosecutor in Abolitionist Praxis.pdf,pdf_first_page

"When  I  came to  the  United  States Attorney's Office in 1983, it became  apparent that this was an  office with  a  proud  tradition. The office expressed pride in  its past in  various ways:  for example, new assistants were  provided Emory Buckner's biography 1  and  the  office's walls were  arrayed with  photographs of former  United States Attorneys and  criminal division chiefs. Senior lawyers in  the  office served as  a  link to  its past. But  because  lawyers generally left the office within a  few  years after fulfilling their three-year commitment, there were  not many of these  ""senior"" lawyers around and, with  the exception of one, they were  really not very  senior. Bill Tendy was,  of course, the  exception. He was  the one  prosecutor who had  served in that office in  the decades  of the  50s, 60s  and  70s.  He was,  thus, the bridge to, and  symbol  of, the  office's past. He was the  embodiment of the  office's great tradition, of which  new prosecutors strived to  be worthy.",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The precise nature of  the  office's great tradition was somewhat elusive, however.  To be  sure, the  office had  its rituals -for example, on  his or  her first morning  in  the  office, the  young  and, at least in  my case, disoriented lawyer  was ""sworn in""  by the  United States Attorney and  congratulated by  his or  her new colleagues. But  these rituals, as  well as  the  various training sessions on complaints, grand jury practice, evidence, sentencing, and  the  like, tended to  look  forward,  not backward.  Even  so, one  would  eventually infer that, even though  the  personnel of the  office might  have  changed  over time, as did  the  identity of  investigators and  judges, and in  some ways the criminal law  and  procedure itself, there was  something essential that the  office was committed to  achieving and  preserving.",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"for judgment. It  was important  hat its acts appear to  be  well  motivated, that it's lawyers' word be  trusted. All  of this and  more was captured by the  concept that prosecutors in  the  office had  a  ""duty to do  justice.""",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  some  sense, Southern District prosecutors felt that they  owned the  concept. It certainly set us  apart from  the  defense lawyers with whom  we interacted. But, in  some ways,  at  least in  the  early 1980s, we felt, no  doubt arrogantly, that it distinguished us  from  other prosecutors, perhaps even  other federal prosecutors, as  well.  We felt as  if we defined the  term -which  of course we didn't -or  at least gave it new,  or  special, meaning.  In  fulfilling this duty, we preserved the office's great tradition (or, in failing to  fulfill it, we risked tarnishing the  office's reputation).",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The source of the  duty  was  never identified, however.  Thus, what might  be accepted by many as  an  article of faith might  be viewed skeptically by  some.  Nor, for that matter, was  the duty  ever precisely defined. The  concept was  protean as  well as  vague.  It  assumed  different meanings  in  different contexts, meanings  that one  could  only infer. One incarnation related to  our  exercise of discretion -how to  decide, for example, whether to  charge a  guilty individual or  defer prosecution, or  what  terms  of a  plea  bargain should be  acceptable. In  this context, ""doing justice"" meant  seeking to  achieve a ""just,"" and  not  necessarily the  most  harsh, result. In  the  trial context, the concept seemed  to  mean something else, however.  It  had  something to  do  with fidelity tothe fairness of the process -the  idea that, if the trial was a  fair one,  then even  when the  jury acquitted a  defendant whom  we were  convinced was guilty, justice was done.  Sometimes the  concept was implicit in  the  way a  senior lawyer worked  through a  hard question with  a  new  prosecutor: What,  she  might ask, was  the right  hing to  do? For  those who were  believers, doing justice was an animating principle; it was  the  office's life blood, often silent, unseen, taken  for granted.",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Some lawyers outside the  office took  an  interest in  seeing that its traditions were preserved. These included federal district judges who  were  former federal prosecutors. They reminded prosecutors of  their duty  to  do  justice, sometimes  when they  expressed concern about the  prosecutor's conduct, but often (perhaps to  the  consternation of defense counsel) when they  credited the  prosecutor's representations or  assumed  (absent an  indication to  the  contrary) that the prosecutor was complying  with  his  or  her  procedural obligations and  acting in good  faith. At  times, although their purpose in  doing so was not  necessarily quite so  disinterested, defense lawyers who",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"were  alumni of the  office also reminded prosecutors of their duty  to seek justice. More than  other defense lawyers, they  might be willing to  proceed on the  basis of  oral understandings, oreven  tacit ones.",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"These  interactions showed why it was important for the  office to preserve its reputation. They  provided evidence of how new prosecutors, who were  not known personally to  judges and  defense lawyers, nevertheless received the  benefit of the  office's reputation, and how they  were  able to  work  more easily and  effectively as  a  result. Indeed, even when prosecutors erred or  overreached, they  often benefitted from  serving in  an  office that was identified with the  tradition of  doing justice. For  example, excesses in  jury argument were often perceived to  be  good-faith, youthful indiscretions (which  they were), rather than acts of intentional wrongdoing, as  they  might have appeared.",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"At  the  same  time, however, lawyers outside the  office sometimes expressed skepticism about  whether  its traditions were being  adequately maintained. Indeed, in the  eyes  of a  former prosecutor from any  generation, it was almost axiomatic that the  office began  to  go downhill on  the  very day  that the particular lawyer left it for private practice. Of  course, there were  good  reasons for someone  viewing the  office with  detachment (or, as  in  the  case  of a  defense lawyer, from  the  other side) to  be  skeptical. As important as  the  concept of ""doing justice"" may have  been, there have  always  been  cross-cutting themes  in  the prosecutor's office. Most  significantly, there was a  tradition of machismo,  of the prosecutor as  aggressive trial lawyer facing  down the  lawbreaking adversary. As  Jerry Lynch  has  noted, this was a tradition which  Bill Tendy,  the  quintessential tough-talking prosecutor, embodied  more than anyone. 2",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The office's challenge was,  thus, to  reconcile the  ideal of  ""doing justice"" with  the  image  of the  strong prosecutor-to conceptualize ""doing justice"" in  muscular, and unsentimental, terms, so that a prosecutor could  ""do  justice"" without appearing weak.  For a  young Bill Tendy,  this may have  been  easy.  No  one  would  have  thought him  weak.  Besides, ""doing justice"" would  have  been  conceptualized in  narrower terms  in  his  formative, pre-Miranda years, requiring prosecutors to  tell the  truth and  keep  their word, but  allowing them to  be  less concerned about procedural niceties. For  a  contemporary assistant, however, it may be  more difficult to  reconcile the  professional ideal with  the  public image  of the prosecutor. There  is  therefore  a greater need to give  content to the  federal prosecutor's",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Is the  professional ethos of  public prosecutors different from  that of  other  lawyers? If so,  to  what extent are  public  prosecutors therefore obligated to  conduct  themselves  differently from other lawyers?  There  are  no  universally accepted answers  to  these questions. Even though  lawyers  have  undertaken the  task of  representing  public entities in  the  prosecution of  criminal charges  for many years, the  ethical implications of  this task  remain  contested. Now familiar, and  well  over  a  decade  old, are  the  battles over  how prosecutors  exercise  their investigative authority -in particular, whether  ethical rules should  restrain prosecutors when they  seek  to issue grand  jury subpoenas  to  criminal defense  lawyers 3  or  when they seek  to  question defendants and  other represented persons, or permit  investigators to  do so,  without the  knowledge and  permission  of  the  person's lawyer. 4",cover_heinonline,Green - 1998 - Why Should Prosecutors Seek Justice The Changing Role of the Federal Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"A  new  and  recognizable group of reform-minded prosecutors has assumed the mantle ofprogressive  prosecution. The term is hard  to define in part  because its adherents embrace a diverse set of  policies and  priorities. In comparing the contemporary  movement with Progressive  Era prosecutors, this  Article has two related  goals. First, it seeks to better  define progressive prosecution. Second,  it uses  a historical  comparison to  draw some  lessons for the  current  movement.  Both groups of  prosecutors  were elected on  a  wave of  popular  support. Unlike today's  mainstream prosecutors  who tend to campaign  and  labor  in relative obscurity, these two sets  of  prosecutors  received a good  deal of  popular attention  and support. The Progressive  Era reformers introduced  the  notion  promoted by  current progressive  prosecutors  that  crime is a social  phenomenon, which community  services  are  better  equipped  to  address  than prisons.  The Progressive  Era  movement also sought  to implement  professional  norms and practices to promote the values of  fairness and  proportionality. Contemporary  progressive prosecutors inherit this legacy  but tend not to emphasize these  professional  values. The Article  concludes that  the professional  values championed  during the Progressive  Era  are critical, in conjunction with new programs and  policies,  to  ensure that as innovation",cover_heinonline,Green and Roiphe - 2020 - When Prosecutors Politick Progressive Law Enforcers Then and Now Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Progressive  prosecutors differ from  their more  traditional counterparts  primarily in the way  in which they make decisions. They tend to  bind their  discretion by  announcing  categorical  policies rather  than making  fact-based  decisions case by  case. This Article catalogs the unusual degree of  pushback  progressive  prosecutors have  encountered  from  the public,  legislatures, courts, police,  and their own  subordinate  prosecutors.  Drawing  on fiduciary theory,  it explains this reaction as a response to progressive  prosecutors'  abdication  of their  fiduciary role. As a  public fiduciary, prosecutors are  entrusted with  protecting the  public's abstract  interest  in justice, and an integral  part of this role is exercising discretion in  individual  cases based on a broad array of relevant considerations.  This ad hoc discretionary  decision-making  process assures  the public that  prosecutors are  drawing  on  their  expertise  to  pursue justice in  a  basic  sense  rather than coopting the process  for the benefit of some subset of the public. The Article concludes  by  suggesting ways  in  which  progressive  prosecutors can pursue  their conception of  justice while still adhering  to  the  fiduciary role.",cover_heinonline,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Since 2016, candidates labeled  as  ""progressive  prosecutors""  have  achieved increasing  success  at the  polls.' They  are brought together,  and supported, by notfor-profit  organizations  such  as  Fair and Just Prosecution 2 and the  Association  of Prosecuting  Attorneys. 3 Elected  as  reformers,  these  prosecutors  have  generally responded  to  over-incarceration  and  racial  injustice  in  the  criminal  process  by adopting policies  to reduce the number of prosecutions of low-level  criminal cases, decrease  the number of defendants jailed before  trial, and hold police  accountable for  overreach. 4 Many  progressive  prosecutors  have  faced  pushback from judges, other public officials,  police,  the media,  constituents,  and subordinate prosecutors. This Article  draws a  distinction between  progressive  criminal justice  goals  and the process by which contemporary progressive  prosecutors seek  to obtain these  goals, arguing that the goals  are certainly legitimate  and may  be laudable, but the process of  implementing  them  is  often  both  inconsistent  with  the  prosecutor's role  and likely to  invite challenges.",cover_heinonline,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Progressive prosecutors tend to be more closely  identified with a political movement than their more traditional colleagues  and predecessors. 6 Traditionally, prosecutors,  like  judges,  convey that  they  are  non-ideological. Indeed,  the  role  has sometimes been  characterized  as  quasi-judicial. Often, traditional prosecutors have  given  the  impression  that, like  judges,  they  make  decisions  that are  dictated by  the  law  and  facts  without regard to  political  or policy  preferences. Although they have  at times decided not to enforce  certain laws  that they regard as outmoded or trivial,  and have adopted internal policies  to ensure that similar cases  are treated",cover_heinonline,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page

"In  several  respects,  progressive  prosecutors tend  to  resemble  other  political actors-that  is,  other  elected executive-branch  officials  or  legislators-more  than judges.  They  often draw  support from left-leaning  political  action committees  and further  support  from a  national progressive  constituency. 1 0 Once  elected,  progressive  prosecutors  have  adopted  and  announced  policies  directed  at reducing  incarceration  or  promoting  racial  equity  in  criminal  law  enforcement."" Often,  these policies  involve declining  to prosecute categories  of low-level crimes, declining  to employ sentencing enhancements,  or declining to seek pretrial incarceration in certain  types  of cases. 1 2 Where  traditional  prosecutors  purported  to  make  individual discretionary  decisions  based  on  considerations  internal  to  criminal  law  enforcement,  such  as  whether  a prosecution  would promote  deterrence  or  retribution  or would  be  disproportionately  harsh  given  the nature  of the  criminal  conduct,  progressive  prosecutors'  categorical  policies  appear  more  political because  they  are based  on  explicit  public-policy  judgments  external  to  the  individual  facts  of the case.13  Further,  these  prosecutors' categorical  declination  policies  invite political controversy  because  they  appear  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  political  judgments underlying  the  criminal laws-namely,  a judgment  by  legislators  that  the laws  in question  should  at  least  sometimes  be  enforced. 14 Finally,  in  announcing  broad policies-not  simply  announcing  individual  indictments  and  convictions-progressive  prosecutors  often  appear  more  like other  political  actors  in  the sense  that they seem to be making law, not just enforcing it in  individual cases.",cover_heinonline,Green and Roiphe - 2023 - A Fiduciary Theory of Progressive Prosecution Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecution.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The approach that progressive prosecutors  take in adopting and publicizing categorical  policies  aligned  with progressive  goals  is not  primarily  an ideological  departure  from  the  traditional  approach  because  traditional  prosecutors  could  share progressive  prosecutors' ideological preferences.  It  is primarily  a difference  in  the process by which the office makes  and announces  decisions.

"As  the most powerful actors in our criminal  legal system, prosecutors have been and remain one of the principal  drivers of  mass incarceration. This was  and  is  by design. Prosecutorial  power  derives from our constitutional  structure-prosecutors  are given almost unfettered discretion  to determine  who  to charge, what to charge, and, often,  what the sentence will be.  Within  that structure, the prosecutor's  duty  is  to  ensure that justice  is done. Yet, in exercising  their  outsized  power,  some prosecutors  have  fully embraced  a  secondary, adversarial role  as a  partisan advocate at the significant  cost of  seeking  justice.",cover_heinonline,Hasbrouck - 2021 - The Just Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The  necessary  reforms  of our carceral system  must  begin  with  the prosecutor.  Our  adversarial system of justice  so  compellingly  turns prosecutors  away  from doing  justice to maximizing convictions that it can seem impossible to be  both a good  person and a good prosecutor. When even progressive  prosecutors can be  turned into win-seekers rather than neutral  agents  of justice,  Blackness  is  punished.  Black  people  are disproportionally  arrested, charged, convicted,  and sentenced  for longer than the  population  overall. Rejecting adversarialism  is therefore  essential, but that alone will not be enough-in order to  act in the interest of  justice, a  prosecutor must  consciously  replace  adversarialism as  a  guiding ideology.",cover_heinonline,Hasbrouck - 2021 - The Just Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article imagines  prosecutors  as solely just actors in  our criminal legal system.  The prosecutor's function  as a minister of  justice remains underexamined  and  undertheorized. So, what is a  just  prosecutor?  My thesis is  that  abolition  constitutionalism,  critical originalism,  and the  liberation justice of hip-hop  and  the  Movement for  Black  Lives  can  be  used  in constructing  a  prosecutor  that  improves the ideology and  administration  of justice  in the United States.  Abolition  constitutionalism demands  that prosecutors  advance  civil liberties, equal protection,  and  due  process  rights",cover_heinonline,Hasbrouck - 2021 - The Just Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"for  criminal defendants  throughout the entire  criminal process.  For example,  prosecutors should  provide  Brady  exculpatory  material  to defendants  prior  to entering  any  plea  agreements  andjoin  a  prisoner's postconviction motion when they are  actually innocent of the underlying  crime. Critical  originalism confirms that the  criminalization  of the  use of drugs was driven by racial  considerations  and  requires that  prosecutors  leverage statutes, such as the Speedy Trial  Act,  to create robust  diversion  programs for non-violent drug  offenders. And prosecutors  that understand  liberation justice appreciate  that  our system  was  designed to  target and imprison Black and  Brown people. Because of  this  profound  unfairness,  prosecutors must become movement lawyers who  work to dismantle white supremacy through  decriminalization of drug offenses,  prosecutorial  nullification, expungement  motions,  and the  elimination of cash bail.  There is  much common  ground in  these seemingly  disparate threads of theory,  where justice is painted-not  in  definitional  words, but in  concrete actions-for prosecutors.",cover_heinonline,Hasbrouck - 2021 - The Just Prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Abstract. In misdemeanor  cases,  pretrial  detention poses  a particular problem because  it may induce innocent defendants to  plead guilty  in order to  exit jail, potentially  creating widespread  error  in  case  adjudication.  While  practitioners  have  long  recognized this possibility, empirical  evidence on  the  downstream  impacts  of  pretrial  detention  on misdemeanor defendants and their cases  remains limited. This Article uses  detailed data on hundreds of thousands of misdemeanor cases resolved  in Harris County, Texas-the thirdlargest  county  in the United  States-to  measure the effects  of pretrial detention  on  case outcomes  and future crime.  We find that detained defendants  are 25% more likely  than similarly situated releasees  to plead guilty,  are 43% more likely  to be  sentenced  to jail, and receive  jail sentences  that are  more  than twice  as  long  on  average.  Furthermore, those detained pretrial are more likely  to  commit future crimes, which  suggests  that detention may have  a criminogenic  effect.  These  differences  persist even after fully  controlling  for the initial bail amount, offense, demographic information, and criminal history characteristics.  Use  of more  limited sets  of  controls,  as  in  prior research,  overstates  the adverse impacts of detention. A quasi-experimental analysis  based on case timing confirms that these  differences likely reflect  the  causal  effect of  detention.  These  results  raise important constitutional  questions and suggest  that Harris  County  could  save millions  of dollars  per  year,  increase  public  safety,  and  reduce  wrongful  convictions with  better pretrial release policy.",cover_heinonline,Heaton et al. - 2017 - The Downstream Consequences of Misdemeanor Pretrial Detention.pdf,pdf_first_page

"ABSTRACT:  The conventional  academic wisdom is that  prosecutor  elections are little  more than empty  exercises.  Using a  new,  national  survey  of local prosecutor  elections-the  first of its kind-this  Article offers a  more complete account  of the legal and empirical  landscape.  It  confirms that  incumbents are rarely contested and almost always win. But it  moves  beyond extant work to consider  the  nature of local political conflict,  including how  often  local prosecutors face  any  contestation  or any degree  of  competition.  It also demonstrates  a significant  difference in  the degree  of  incumbent entrenchment based on time  in  office.  Most importantly, it  reveals a  stark divide between rural  and urban  prosecution. Urban  areas are more likely to hold a contested election than rural  areas.  Rural  areas,  in which very few  lawyers live, rarely hold contested elections and sometimes  are not able  to field  even  a  single candidate  for  a  prosecutor election.  The  results suggest  that the  nascent movement  to  use prosecutor  elections as a source of criminal  justice reform may have success, at least in  the short term. But elections are, as of now, not a  likely  source of reform in  rural  areas-the  very  areas where incarceration rates continue to rise.",cover_heinonline,Hessick and Morse - 2019 - Picking Prosecutors.pdf,pdf_first_page

Despite  its size, the  ""carceral  state  has  been  a  largely  invisible  feature""  of American politics:  Much  of the rise  of mass  incarceration  over the  last five decades  has happened without significant public  debate.2  This  is  in  part because  there  is no  single,  national  criminal justice  system,  but  rather  a patchwork  of local systems.

"This Article challenges  the narrative  that the progressive  prosecutor  movement can meaningfully transform the criminal legal system and  argues that the myopic focus on prosecutors  as the  solution to  all that ails this system further diminishes the critical,  and chronically  under-resourced,  role of  the public defender.",cover_heinonline,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In presenting this claim, we  do  not question the  sincerity of many  self-styled progressive  prosecutors'  desires to  ""make a difference"" in the criminal  legal system or whether these prosecutors  have in  fact modified norms and  practices  positively  in some jurisdictions. But  in  our view,  the record reveals mostly  modest changes and substantial,  multidirectional  resistance to  anything more. And  this record should not  be  a  surprise, as prosecutors are executive  branch officers with a job description  primarily  of charging  and  punishing  crime in  an adversarial system. The  progressive prosecutor movement  nevertheless  has  become another way for prosecutor  offices  to  expand their mission, deepen their resources, and  accrue  power to  do  'justice.""",cover_heinonline,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf,pdf_first_page
"We  emphasize a  different path to  meaningful change: well-resourced, highly functioning public defense  systems.  We  do  not claim that public defenders are a panacea or a  comparable solution to  abolition. But we  explore how  a greater commitment to public defense  more meaningfully can change the  lives of people and communities impacted by our criminal legal system  by empowering the professionals with the  role and training, the professional  incentives, and the  institutional  values  to  pursue material and sustainable change. In  our  view, truly progressive prosecutors would  cede  more  resources and power to  the  defense rather  than expand the mission and  power of  prosecutors.",cover_heinonline,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This  Article  critiques  the  ""progressive  prosecutor""  movement  as  a  vehicle  for serious change  in  the  criminal  legal system  and  argues that  fully  resourcing defenders  is a far better strategy.' The progressive prosecutor movement has  generated  significant  political, professional,  media,  and  academic attention  in  recent years  with hyperbolic  claims that progressive  prosecutors  will ""end mass  incarceration  and restore  fairness to the criminal  system 'without  changing a  single law.""' In the movement's most ambitious form, progressive prosecutors are cast as having the  power  to  transform  the  criminal  legal system  into  a  true  justice  system. 3 Embracing this  trend,  several prosecutors  in recent  years  have branded themselves explicitly in their political identities  as  some form of progressive  prosecutor. 4",cover_heinonline,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  sharing  our critique,  we  start  by  acknowledging  the  obvious:  as  progressive academics and  former  public  defenders, we  would  rather  have  a  progressiveminded prosecutor than a traditional  ""law and order"" prosecutor  or, especially,  one of the  many  available  models  of regressive  prosecutors  who  still  circulate.'

"1. No  universal definition exists for a  ""progressive prosecutor."" See Benjamin Levin, Imagining the Progressive  Prosecutor, 105  MINN.  L.  REV. 1415,  1416-18  (2021)  (observing  that  ""'progressive  prosecutor' means  many different  things to  many different  people""). For our purposes, progressive  prosecutor  does not mean simply  a prosecutor  whose politics are  progressive.  We  understand progressive  prosecutor  to  mean a prosecutor who  claims  to  seek  progressive  reform  of the  criminal  legal  system  from  within  the  power  structures  of  that system.",cover_heinonline,Holland and Zeidman - 2023 - Progressive Prosecutors or Zealous Defenders_ from Coast-to-Coast Symposium Reform-Minded Prosecuti.pdf,pdf_first_page

## RACIAL EQUITY IN ALGORITHMIC CRIMINAL JUSTICE,cover_jstor,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Algorithmic  tools  for  predicting  violence  and  criminality  are increasingly  deployed  in  policing,  bail,  and  sentencing.  Scholarly attention  to  date  has  focused  on  these  tools'  procedural  due  process implications. This Article considers their interaction with the enduring racial  dimensions  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  I  consider  two alternative  lenses  for  evaluating  the  racial  effects  of  algorithmic criminal justice: constitutional doctrine and emerging technical standards  of  'algorithmic  fairness.'  I  argue  first  that  constitutional doctrine is poorly suited to the task. It often fails to capture the full spectrum of racial issues that can arise in the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice. Emerging technical standards of algorithmic fairness are at least attentive to the specifics of the relevant technology. But the technical literature has failed to grapple with how, or whether, various technical conceptions of fairness track policy-significant consequences. Drawing on the technical literature, I propose a reformulated metric for  considering  racial  equity  concerns  in  algorithmic  design:  Rather than  asking  about  abstract  definitions  of  fairness,  a  criminal  justice algorithm should be evaluated in terms of its long-term, dynamic effects on  racial stratification.  The  metric  of  nondiscrimination  for  an",cover_jstor,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

"From the cotton gin to the camera phone, new technologies have scrambled, invigorated, and refashioned the terms on which the state coerces. Today, we are in the throes of another major reconfiguration. Police,  courts,  and  parole  boards  across  the  country  are  turning  to sophisticated  algorithmic  instruments  to  guide  decisions  about  the where, whom,  and  when  of  law  enforcement. 1 New  predictive algorithms trawl immense quantities of data, exploit massive computational power, and leverage new machine-learning technologies to generate predictions no human could conjure. These tools are likely to have enduring effects on the criminal justice system. Yet law remains far behind in thinking through the difficult questions that arise when machine learning substitutes for human discretion.",cover_jstor,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"My aim in this Article is to isolate one important design margin for  evaluating  algorithmic  criminal  justice:  the  effect  of  algorithmic criminal  justice  tools  on racial  equity .  I  use  this  capacious  term  to capture the complex ways in which the state's use of a technology can implicate normative and legal concerns related to racial dynamics. The Article  considers  a  number  of  ways  in  which  legal  scholars  and computer scientists have theorized how criminal justice interacts with racial  patterning  in  practice.  It  analyzes  the  utility  of  each  lens  for evaluating new algorithmic technologies. A primary lesson concerns the parameter  that best captures racial equity concerns in an algorithmic  setting:  I  suggest  that  the  leading  metrics  advanced  by computer scientists are not sufficient, and propose an alternative. A secondary  lesson  relates  to  the  fit  between  problems  of  race  in  the algorithmic context on the one hand, and legal or technical conceptions of equality on the other. Reflection on technological change, that is, casts light on the approaching desuetude of equal protection doctrine.",cover_jstor,Huq - 2019 - Racial equity in algorithmic criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

These powers have been granted to our law-enforcement agencies because it seems necessary that such a power to prosecute be lodged somewhere. This authority has been granted by people who really wanted the right thing done-wanted crime eliminated -but also wanted the best in our American traditions preserved.,cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Because of this immense power to strike at citizens, not with mere individual strength, but with all the force of government itself, the post of Federal District Attorney from the very beginning has been safeguarded by presidential appointment, requiring confirmation of the Senate of the United States.

"It would probably be within the range of that exaggeration permitted in Washington to say that assembled in this room is one of the most powerful peace-time forces known to our country. The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous. He can have citizens investigated and, if he is that kind of person, he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations. Or the prosecutor may choose a more subtle course and simply have a citizen's friends interviewed. The prosecutor can order arrests, present cases to the grand jury in secret session, and on the basis of his one-sided presentation of the facts, can cause the citizen to be indicted and held for trial. He may dismiss the case before trial, in which case the defense never has a chance to be heard. Or he may go on with a public trial. If he obtains a conviction, the prosecutor can still make recommendations as to sentence, as to whether the prisoner should get probation or a suspended sentence, and after he is put away, as to whether he is a fit subject for parole. While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"rare instance in which the local District Attorney should be superseded in the handling of litigation, except where he requests help of Washington. It is also clear that with his knowledge of local sentiment and opinion, his contact with and intimate knowledge of the views of the court, and his acquaintance with the feelings of the group from which jurors are drawn, it is an unusual case in which his judgment should be overruled.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Experience, however, has demonstrated that some measure of centralized control is necessary. In the absence of it different district attorneys were striving for different interpretations or applications of an Act, or were pursuing different conceptions of policy. Also, to put it mildly, there were differences in the degree of diligence and zeal in different districts. To promote uniformity of policy and action, to establish some standards of performance, and to make available specialized help, some degree of centralized administration was found necessary.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"you can also afford to be just. Although the government technically loses its case, it has really won if justice has been done. The lawyer in public office is justified in seeking to leave behind him a good record. But he must remember that his most alert and severe, but just, judges will be the members of his own profession, and that lawyers rest their good opinion of each other not merely on results accomplished but on the quality of the performance. Reputation has been called ""the shadow cast by one's daily life."" Any prosecutor who risks his day-to-day professional name for fair dealing to build up statistics of success has a perverted sense of practical values, as well as defects of character. Whether one seeks promotion to a judgeship, as many prosecutors rightly do, or whether he returns to private practice, he can have no better asset than to have his profession recognize that his attitude toward those who feel his power has been dispassionate, reasonable and just.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Our problem, of course, is to balance these opposing considerations. I desire to avoid any lessening of the prestige and influence of the district attorneys in their districts. At the same time we must proceed in all districts with that uniformity of policy which is necessary to the prestige of federal law.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The federal prosecutor has now been prohibited from engaging in political activities. I am convinced that a goodfaith acceptance of the spirit and letter of that doctrine will relieve many district attorneys from the embarrassment of what have heretofore been regarded as legitimate expectations of political service. There can also be no doubt that to be closely identified with th intrigue, the money raising, and the machinery of a particular party or faction may present a prosecuting officer with embarrassing alignments and associations. I think the Hatch Act should be utilized by federal pros cutors as a protection against demand",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"on their time and their p participate in the operation chinery of practical politics. searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm-in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of. abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In times of fear or hysteria political, racial, religious, social, and economic groups, often from the best of motives, cry for the scalps of individuals or groups because they do not like their views. Particularly do we need to be dispassionate and courageous in those cases which deal with so-called ""subversive activities."" They are dangerous to civil liberty because the prosecutor has no definite standards to determine what constitutes a ""subversive activity,"" such as we have for murder or larceny. Activities which seem benevolent and helpful to wage earners, persons on relief, or those who are disadvantaged in the struggle for existence may be regarded as ""subversive"" by those whose property interests might be burdened or affected thereby. Those who are in office are apt to regard as ""subversive"" the activities of any of thosewho would bring about a change of administration. Some of ouir soundest constitutional doctrines were once punished as subversive. We must not forget that it was not so long ago that",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"There is a most important reason why the prosecutor should have, as nearly as possible, a detached and impartial view of all groups in his community. Law enforcement is not automatic. It isn't blind. One of the greatest difficulties of the position of prosecutor is that he must pick his cases, because no prosecutor can even investigate all of the cases in which he receives complaints. If the Department of Justice were to make even a pretense of reaching every probable violation of federal law, ten times its present staff would be inadequate. We know that no local police force can strictly enforce the traffic laws, or it would arrest half the driving population on any given morning. What every prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases, it follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted. With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"both the term ""Rep term ""Democrat"" w sinister meaning to radical tendencies that were ""subversive"" of the order of things then dominant. In the enforcement of laws which protect our national integrity and existence, we should prosecute any and every act of violation, but only overt acts, not the expression of opinion, or activities such as the holding of meetings, petitioning of Congress, or dissemination of news or opinions. Only by extreme care can we protect the spirit as well as the letter of our civil liberties, and to do so is a responsibility of the federal prosecutor. entirely. The same variation of attitudes towards other law-enforcement problems exists. The federal government could not enforce one kind of law in one place and another kind elsewhere. It could hardly adopt strict standards for loose states or loose standards for strict states without doing violence to local sentiment. In spite of the temptation to divert our power to local conditions where they have become offensive to our sense of decency, the only long-term policy that will save federal justice from being discredited by entanglements with local politics is that it confine itself to strict and impartial enforcement of federal law, letting the chips fall in the community where they may. Just as there should be no permitting of local considerations to stop federal enforcement, so there should be no striving to enlarge our power over local affairs and no use of federal prosecutions to exert an indirect influence that would be unlawful if exerted directly.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The qualities of a good prosecutor are as elusive and as impossible to define as those which mark a gentleman. And those who need to be told would not understand it anyway. A sensitiveness to fair play and sportsmanship is perhaps the best protection against the abuse of power, and the citizen's safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with humility.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Another delicate task is to distinguish between the federal and the local in law-enforcement activities. We must bear in mind that we are concerned only with the prosecution of acts which the Congress has made federal offenses. Those acts we should prosecute regardless of local sentiment, regardless of whether it exposes lax local enforcement, regardless of whether it makes or breaks local politicians.",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page
"But outside of federal law each locality has the right under our system of government to fix its own standards of law enforcement and of morals. And the moral climate of the United States is as varied as its physical climate. For example, some states legalize and permit gambling, some states prohibit it legislatively and protect it administratively, and some try to prohibit it",cover_jstor,Jackson - 1940 - The federal prosecutor.pdf,pdf_first_page

"ABSTRACT. Proportionality, accepted as a general principle of  constitutional law by many countries,  requires that government intrusions  on freedoms  be justified,  that greater intrusions  have  stronger justifications,  and  that punishments  reflect  the  relative  severity  of the  offense.  Proportionality  as  a  doctrine  developed  by  courts,  as  in  Canada, has  provided  a  stable methodological  framework,  promoting structured,  transparent  decisions  even  about closely contested  constitutional  values.  Other benefits  of proportionality  include  its  potential  to  bring constitutional  law closer to constitutional justice,  to provide  a common  discourse about rights for all branches  of government,  and to help identify the kinds of failures  in democratic  process warranting heightened judicial  scrutiny. Earlier U.S.  debates  over  ""balancing"" were  not informed by recent comparative  experience with structured proportionality  doctrine and its benefits.",cover_heinonline,Jackson - 2014 - Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Many  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law  include  some  elements  of what  is  elsewhere  called proportionality  analysis.  I argue  here for greater  use  of  proportionality  principles  and doctrine;  I also  argue  that  proportionality  review  is  not  the  answer  to  all  constitutional  rights  questions. Free  speech  can benefit  from categorical  presumptions,  but in their application  and design proportionality  may be  relevant.  The  Fourth Amendment,  which  secures  a  ""right""  against  ""unreasonable  searches  and  seizures,""  is  replete with  categorical  rules  protecting  police  conduct from judicial  review; more  case-by-case  analysis  of the  ""unreasonableness"" or  disproportionality  of police conduct would better protect rights and the rule of  law.  ""Disparate impact"" equality  claims might be  better  addressed  through  more proportionate  review standards;  Eighth  Amendment review  of  prison sentences  would benefit from  more use  of  proportionality  principles.  Recognizing  proportionality's advantages,  and  limits,  would  better  enable  U.S.  constitutional  law to  at once protect rights and facilitate effective  democratic self-governance.",cover_heinonline,Jackson - 2014 - Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality.pdf,pdf_first_page

"""Proportionality""  is  today accepted  as  a general  principle  of law  by  constitutional  courts and  international  tribunals  around  the world.' ""Proportionality review,""  a  structured form of doctrine, now flows  across  national  lines,  a seemingly  common  methodology  for  evaluating  many  constitutional  and  human rights  claims. 2 The  United  States  is  often  viewed  as  an  outlier in  this  transnational  embrace  of proportionality  in  constitutional  law. 3 Yet some areas  of  U.S. constitutional law embrace proportionality as a principle, as in  Eighth Amendment  case  law, 4 or  contain  other  elements  of the  structured  ""proportionality  review""  widely  used  in  foreign  constitutional  jurisprudence,'  including the  inquiry into  ""narrow tailoring"" or ""less  restrictive  alternatives"" found  in U.S. strict scrutiny. 6",cover_heinonline,Jackson - 2014 - Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Justice  Stephen Breyer has  suggested that there are  other areas  in which the appropriate  standard  of judicial  review  would  involve  examining  the  proportionality  of government  regulation.'

"1. In 2004, Canadian  scholar  David  Beatty asserted  that proportionality  review  was  the  ""ultimate""  rule of law  for  resolving constitutional  questions  about rights;  as  a positive  matter, it was  the  dominant method  of constitutional  interpretation  in  the world,  and as a normative matter,  it  was  superior to  such  other methods  as  originalism or  textualism. DAVID M. BEATTY, THE ULTIMATE RULE  OF LAW 159-88 (2004). In 2005, U.S. legal  scholar David Law  identified  proportionality  as  a  ""generic""  component  of constitutional  adjudication  around  the world.  David S.  Law, Generic Constitutional  Law, 89 MINN. L. REV. 652  (2005). On  the  role of  proportionality in  international  law and  administrative law, see, for  example,  HCJ 2056/04 Beit Sourik Vill.

## ARRESTS AS REGULATION,cover_heinonline,Jain - 2015 - Arrests as Regulation.pdf,pdf_first_page
"For some arrested individuals,  the most  important consequences of  their  arrest  arise  outside the criminal  justice  system.  Arrests  alone-regardless of  whether they result in conviction-can  lead to a  range of  consequences,  including deportation, eviction, license  suspension, custody disruption, or adverse employment  actions. But  even as courts,  scholars,  and others  have  drawn  needed attention to  the civil consequences of  criminal  convictions,  they have paid  relatively little  attention  to  the consequences  of  arrests  in their  own right. This Article aims to  fill  that  gap  by providing an account of  how arrests  are  systemically used outside the criminal  justice system.  Noncriminal  justice actors who  rely on  arrests-such as immigration  enforcement officials, public housing authorities,  employers,  licensing authorities, and  child  protective service  providers, among others-routinely  receive and use arrest information  for their own  objectives. They do so not because arrests  are the best regulatory tools but  because  they regard arrests as proxies  for information they value,  and  because arrests  are often  easy and inexpensive  to  access.  But  when  noncriminal  justice  actors  rely  on  arrests, they  set  off a complicated  and  poorly  understood  web  of interactions with  the criminal  justice system.  Regulatory bodies and others that make decisions based on  arrests  can coordinate  and  pool resources with prosecutors  and  police  officers, achieving  a level of  enforcement that neither  could  achieve  alone, or  they  can make decisions  that undermine important  aspects of  the criminal justice  process. This Article maps different  regulatory interactions based on  arrests and illustrates the need  for  greater  oversight over how arrests  are  used  and  disseminated outside the criminal justice system.",cover_heinonline,Jain - 2015 - Arrests as Regulation.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Arrests  are  more  than  the  point  of entry  into  the  criminal justice  system. They  also drive a host of other decisions.  A  number of actors outside the criminal  justice  system,  such  as  immigration  enforcement  officials,  public  housing authorities,  public  benefits  administrators,  employers,  licensing  authorities,  social  services providers,  and education  officials,  among others, routinely  receive and  review arrest information.

"On January 26, 2014,  Sharnalle Mitchell was sitting on her  couch with her one-year-old daughter on her lap  and her four-year-old son to her  side. Armed government agents entered her home, put her in metal restraints, took her from her  children, and brought her to the Montgomery  City Jail. Jail staff told Sharnalle that she owed the city money for old traffic tickets. The City had privatized the collection of  her debts to a  for-profit ""probation company,"" which had sought a  warrant for her arrest. I happened to be  sitting in the courtroom on the morning that Sharnalle was brought to court, along with dozens of other people who had been jailed because  they owed the  city money.

## UNCONSTITUTIONAL  POLICE PRETEXTS,cover_heinonline,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  Article  unearths the pernicious  effects  of pretextual  policing  on civil  rights and democratic principles. The  Fourth  Amendment's  pretext doctrine has faced widespread  criticism  for enabling  police to  shield the  real reasons  for  searches  and  seizures  from  constitutional  scrutiny.  In  its  ruling on Whren v. United  States, the Supreme  Court established that police  actions, not their motivations, are the relevant factor in determining the constitutionality of  searches and seizures. As a result, police can  use ostensibly legal  justifications  as  a  cover  for  unconstitutional  conduct.  This Article  breaks new  ground by arguing  that pretextual  policing  extends beyond searches  and  seizures.  It  reveals  a  broader  alarming  phenomenon  in which police  use  existing  laws as  a  pretext  to  avoid  accountability  and  expand  the state's carceral  power.",cover_heinonline,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Drawing on  surveys  of police  departments  and judicial  decisions,  this Article traces  how  the  police  deploy  pretext  in new  and  different contexts  to justify  actions  that would  otherwise  be  unconstitutional. It  proffers  case studies  from three  distinct  law  enforcement  practices  to  illustrate  this trend. The  first  study  exposes  that  police  pretextually  claim  crime victim  status under  laws  that  protect  the  confidentiality of victims'  identities  to  shield themselves  from public  accountability  for misconduct.  The second case study reveals police  exploiting juvenile privacy  laws to extend  privacy  protections to officers,  thereby  evading accountability and curtailing  minors' due process rights.  A  third  case  study  shows  how  the  police  abuse  their  authority  by manipulating criminal  statutes  intended  to protect pregnant  people by instead criminalizing  their conduct.",cover_heinonline,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article  thus  brings to  light  new  constitutional concerns with pretextual policing and  calls for  a  reexamination of  its constitutionality beyond  the  Fourth  Amendment.  It  highlights  how  the  expansion  of pretext imperils civil rights and democratic principles, including separation of powers.  By exploiting the constitutional  irrelevance  of pretextual  motivations, police undermine  free  speech,  access  to  information,  and due process  rights that  empower  individuals  to  scrutinize  and  hold  state  actors accountable. Ultimately,  this Article raises  the  stakes of an already  controversial  doctrine",cover_heinonline,LRTPKXR9_Chandrasekher_2016_The effect of police slowdowns on crime.pdf,pdf_first_page

Harris-the  former San  Francisco  District Attorney and California Attorney General-received  significant  support and media attention  that  characterized  her  as  a  ""progressive  prosecutor."" 2 In  a moment  of increasing  public  enthusiasm  for criminal  justice  reform, Harris's rise was frequently framed in terms of her support for a more",cover_heinonline,Levin - 2020 - Imagining the Progressive Prosecutor Essay.pdf,pdf_first_page

My  reading of the debate  over  Harris's record  reveals  less  a  dispute about what she did  in her time  as a  California prosecutor,  or what  she promised to do if elected president, than it does fundamental disagreements  (or, at the very least, troubling sloppiness)  about what constitutes a  ""progressive prosecutor.""

"This  Article  makes  two  contributions to  the fields  of policing and criminal  legal  scholarship.  First, it sounds a cautionary  note about  the use of  individual  prosecutions  to remedy  police brutality. It  argues  that the calls for ways to ease the path to more police  prosecutions from legal  scholars, reformers, and advocates who,  at the same time,  advocate  for a dramatic reduction of the criminal  legal system's  footprint, are deeply problematic. It shows that  police  prosecutions  legitimize the criminal  legal system while at the same time displaying the same racism and ineffectiveness that have been shown to pervade  our  prison-backed  criminal  machinery.",cover_heinonline,Levine - 2020 - Police Prosecutions and Punitive Instincts.pdf,pdf_first_page

"playing themselves  out predictably against  police officers. The  Article argues  that  we should  take the  recent  swell  of  prison  abolitionist scholarship  to  heart  when we  look at  police  prosecutions  and  adds to  that literature  by  exploring  this  controversial set  of  defendants  that  are considered  a third  rail, even among most abolitionists.",cover_heinonline,Levine - 2020 - Police Prosecutions and Punitive Instincts.pdf,pdf_first_page

By allowing  law enforcement to claim that brutality  is an aberration, solvable through use  of the  very  system  that encourages brutality  in the  first  place, we re-inscribe  the  failures  of  policing  and  ignore the  everyday systemic and destructive violence perpetrated  by police on communities of color.  In  order to  achieve racial  justice and real  police reform, we  must reduce our reliance on the police, rather than looking to the criminal  legal  system to solve this crisis.",cover_heinonline,Levine - 2020 - Police Prosecutions and Punitive Instincts.pdf,pdf_first_page

"* Mary A. Lynch,  Kate Stoneman  Chair in Law and Democracy,  Albany Law  School. In 1993,  Professor Lynch founded a postconviction clinic in which Albany Law students and she  represented incarcerated survivors of intimate partner and family  violence  who fought back against their abusers. It is not surprising  given  intersectional burdens that  almost  all of  their incarcerated clients  were Black,  Hispanic,  or  Native  Women.  One  of their clients, intimate partner survivor,  Charline Brundidge,  was  the first New  York  State  recipient of gubernatorial  clemency  for  killing  her abusive  partner.  For  the  past  twenty years,  Lynch has  directed  the  Domestic Violence  Prosecution  Hybrid  (DVPH)  Clinic  at Albany  Law  in which  students  work  on domestic  violence and  sexual assault  cases. Lynch  has  been engaged  with anti-violence  work and coordinated community  response  to  intimate partner violence throughout this  time.",cover_heinonline,Lynch - 2020 - Building an Anti-Racist Prosecutorial System Observations from Teaching a Domestic Violence Prosecu.pdf,pdf_first_page

This article,  and the symposium  of which  it is a  part, occurs  at a very challenging  moment-in the midst of a global pandemic  and after a turbulent election  year  culminating  in  the  January 6, 2021  violent storming  of  the  United  States Capitol 1 by  white supremacists  and",cover_heinonline,Lynch - 2020 - Building an Anti-Racist Prosecutorial System Observations from Teaching a Domestic Violence Prosecu.pdf,pdf_first_page

"2. For  a  helpful  working  definition  of  misogyny,  which  I  use  in  gender  scholarship, please see  KATE MANNE,  DOWN GIRL: THE LOGIC OF MISOGYNY  1  (2017).  Manne rejects (as distracting and unhelpful to those who are subject to it)  the dominant but ""naive conception of  misogyny,""  which  focuses  on  individuals  who  hate  ""women qua women,""  or  ""simply because  they  are  women."" Id. at  18-19,  32-33.  Instead,  she  points  out  ""[m]isogyny  may pursue its targets not in the spirit of hating women but,  rather,  of loving justice."" Id. at  1820; see also Mary A.

3. This  truthful  statement does not mean that  every  single  insurrectionist  or rioter was there because of racism or misogyny.  It does not mean that every participant was white or  male. It means  that the emotions  that  carried people  to try to  overturn  the  government at  a  transitional  moment  were  formed  out of  racist  and  misogynistic  thinking.

"A B  S  T  R A C T. Bail  reform is gaining momentum  nationwide.  Reformers  aspire to  untether pretrial detention  from wealth  (the  ability to post money bail)  and condition it instead on statistical risk,  particularly the  risk that a defendant will commit crime if he remains at liberty pending trial. The bail reform movement holds tremendous promise, but it also forces the criminal justice system to confront a difficult question: what statistical risk that a person will commit future crime justifies short-term  detention -if any does? What about lesser restraints on liberty,  like GPS monitoring? Although the turn to actuarial  risk assessment  in the pretrial context has  raised  concern in some quarters,  the debate  so far has largely ignored this foundational question.",cover_heinonline,Mayson - 2017 - Dangerous Defendants.pdf,pdf_first_page
"One way of thinking  about  what level  of crime  risk justifies  restraint  is  to ask whether  the answer is different for defendants than for anyone else. It is generally assumed  that defendants are a special  case,  exempt by virtue of pending charges  from otherwise applicable protections  against preventive  interference.  This Article  challenges  that assumption.  It argues  that,  for purposes  of restraint  for  general  dangerousness,  there  is no clear  constitutional,  moral,  or practical  basis  for distinguishing defendants  from non-defendants  who are equally dangerous. There is thus no basis to conclude  that the risk standard  for such restraint  should  be different  for defendants  than  for anyone else.",cover_heinonline,Mayson - 2017 - Dangerous Defendants.pdf,pdf_first_page

## Prison Abolition and  Grounded  Justice,cover_heinonline,McLeod - 2015 - Prison Abolition and Grounded Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  Article  introduces  to  legal  scholarship  the  first  sustained  discussion  of  prison abolition and what I will call a ""prison abolitionist  ethic.""  Prisons and punitive policing produce  tremendous brutality, violence, racial stratification,  ideological  rigidity, despair, and waste. Meanwhile,  incarceration  and  prison-backed  policing neither  redress  nor repair  the  very  sorts  of harms  they  are  supposed  to  address-interpersonal  violence, addiction,  mental  illness,  and  sexual  abuse,  among  others. Yet despite  persistent  and increasing  recognition  of the deep problems  that attend  U.S. incarceration  and prisonbacked  policing, criminal  law  scholarship  has  largely failed  to  consider  how the  goals of criminal  law-principally  deterrence,  incapacitation,  rehabilitation,  and  retributive justice-might  be  pursued  by  means  entirely  apart  from  criminal  law  enforcement. Abandoning prison-backed punishment  and punitive policing remains generally unfathomable. This  Article  argues  that the  general  reluctance  to engage  seriously  an abolitionist framework represents  a failure  of  moral, legal, and political  imagination. If abolition  is understood to entail simply the  immediate  tearing down  of  all prison walls, then it is  easy to  dismiss  abolition  as  unthinkable. But  if  abolition  consists  instead  of an aspirational  ethic  and a  framework of  gradual decarceration,  which entails a positive substitution  of other  regulatory  forms  for  criminal  regulation,  then  the  inattention  to abolition in criminal law scholarship  and reformist discourse  comes into focus as a more troubling  absence.  Although violent  crime prevention  and proportional punishment of wrongdoing purportedly justify imprisonment, this Article illuminates  how the ends of criminal  law  might  be  accomplished  in  large  measure  through institutions  aside  from criminal law administration.  More specifically, this Article explores  a form  of  grounded preventive  justice neglected  in  existing  scholarly, legal, and  policy accounts.  Grounded preventive justice offers  a positive  substitutive  account of abolition  that aims to displace criminal  law  enforcement  through  meaningful justice  reinvestment  to  strengthen  the social arm of the state and improve human welfare. This positive  substitutive  abolitionist framework would operate  by expanding social  projects to  prevent the need  for carceral responses,  decriminalizing  less  serious  infractions,  improving  the design  of spaces  and products  to  reduce  opportunities for  offending,  redeveloping  and  ""greening""  urban spaces,  proliferating  restorative  forms  of redress,  and  creating  both  safe  harbors  for individuals  at  risk of or fleeing violence  and  alternative  livelihoods  for persons  subject to  criminal law  enforcement. By  exploring prison  abolition  and grounded  preventive justice  in tandem, this Article offers a positive ethical, legal, and institutional framework for conceptualizing  abolition, crime prevention,  and grounded justice together.",cover_heinonline,McLeod - 2015 - Prison Abolition and Grounded Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

"What  is  the  role  of the  public  prosecutor in  criminal procedure?  Such a topic  is  obviously broad  in  its scope and each of  us  may have  a  specific topic in  mind which we believe should be covered.  It  will  be attempted  here,  however, to take  in chronological order  from complaint  through  appeal, certain topics that can  at  least ""paint"" some sort of  completed  picture, if  certain trial procedures are  avoided,  involving the  introduction and  exclusion of  certain evidence. These  subjects cannot be treated generally, and although  opinion  may  vary,  there  are usually only  two views,  the  right and the  wrong,  both  of  which are  more or  less uniform  among  the  various  state and federal courts.",cover_heinonline,Nedrud - 1964 - The Role of the Prosecutor in Criminal Procedure Symposium - American Papers for the International C.pdf,pdf_first_page

"A  large  percentage of  criminal prosecutions begin  with  the arrest of  the  individual without a warrant by some law  enforcement officer during  the investigation. The other  great  bulk of  criminal cases  begin  on the  complaint  of the  victim  or  a police officer and warrant  issued  thereon. The prosecutor has little control over  the  processing of the criminal case which begins  with  an arrest by the  law enforcement officer. He  may refuse to approve,  either by direct right of the  statute or by the  indirect pressure, to  countenance a complaint  by the  magistrate. In  the  latter case the  magistrate will  usually go along with  whatever  the  prosecutor wants,  whether  there be statutory authority or  not. However, in  some states, the  prosecutor does not first approve or necessarily even know  that a complaint is  being  issued and is  called in  after the  fact.' There  are  some cases  which are  started directly with  indictment by the  grand jury, which  we will take up  in  the  next  section.",cover_heinonline,Nedrud - 1964 - The Role of the Prosecutor in Criminal Procedure Symposium - American Papers for the International C.pdf,pdf_first_page

All else  being equal,  prosecution  in  the  federal  forum entails  a significantly  higher  likelihood  of conviction,  and  a higher  penalty.  But why do  such disparities exist?  Conventional  explanations  point  to  differences  among  sovereigns' legal  rules,  resources, and dockets.  These understandings,  while  valid,  neglect to  account  for  a less  tangible  source of federal  criminal  power:  legitimacy.  ""Legitimacy""  refers  to  the  concept,  refined  through  decades of empirical  research,  that  citizens  comply with  the law,  and  defer  to  and  cooperate with  legal authority,  when  they  perceive  both  the  laws  and  the  authorities  to  be  fair.  A  legitimacy-based exploration  of the federal  criminal justice  system  significantly  enriches our understanding  of the sources  of  federal  criminal enforcement  power.  Distilling those  sources, moreover, reveals surprising and counterintuitive implications:  to  emulate  the  sources  of federal legitimacy  in local systems,  we need more localized criminal justice.",cover_heinonline,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf,pdf_first_page

"In  litigation,  forum  matters.  Nowhere  is  that  more  true  than  in  criminal litigation,  where the choice  of court in which to prosecute -state or federal -is perhaps  the single most significant factor  influencing  a case's outcome.  All else being  equal, a  defendant  prosecuted in  federal court  is  more likely  to  be convicted,  and to receive  a  longer sentence  of  imprisonment,  than if  prosecuted for  the  same  conduct  in  state  court.'  The  disparity has  received  particular attention  in  the  area  of so-called  ""street  crimes"" -the drug,  gun,  and  violent offenses  that make up the bulk of urban criminal felony dockets -because  these are  the  sorts  of crimes  that  many  argue  have  historically  been  (and  should continue  to  be)  left  largely  to  the states. 2 For  all  the  focus  on the  merits  and equities  of  federal  prosecution of  street  crime, though,  there  has  been  no concerted  exploration  of the antecedent  question:  why do  the  disparities  exist in the first place?",cover_heinonline,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The  question  is  important  because  interpretations of forum  disparities inform  our  understanding of  the sources  of  federal  criminal  enforcement power.

The  historical  claim is, however,  debatable.  The  federal  government's involvement  in violent  crime  began  around the  time  of the New  Deal,  precisely as  the  federal  government  began to  intervene  in many other areas  previously considered  the proper province  of state  and local  officials but which, today,  are  readily accepted  as  proper  subjects  of federal  control. See Daniel  Richman, The Past,  Present,  and Future of Violent  Crime Federalism, 34  CRIME &amp; JUST.  377, 387 (2006) (noting  that the notorious  kidnapping of Charles  Lindbergh's son in 1932 began  ""a wave of congressional  enactments  targeting  criminal  behavior  that had  hitherto  been  the exclusive province of  state  and local enforcers"").  Nevertheless,  federal  involvement in street crime  did increase  significantly  beginning in the 1960s, see id. at 382,  390-400, and  it is  this relatively more recent policy shift that has generated  criticism.",cover_heinonline,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf,pdf_first_page

The work primarily of social psychologists, criminologists and  criminal law  theorists,  this  frameworkbroadly-termed,  ""legitimacy""-posits  that a system perceived  as providing fair process  and just laws  promotes  compliance  with  the  law  and respect  for  and deference  to  law  enforcement  authorities. 4 The  impressive  body of empirical and theoretical  work on legitimacy  has not yet been  mined for  its  potential  to explain  forum disparities  in criminal adjudication.",cover_heinonline,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  Article  undertakes  that effort.  It offers  a  fresh  look  at  the  causes  of forum disparities  in street  crimes,  an alternative  framework  for  understanding them, and  a  new  agenda  for  inquiry. These  disparities manifest  not  just differences  in  legal  rules  and resource  allocations  but  also  how actors  within the respective criminal justice systems-primarily witnesses, juries, and judges -perceive the  system's legitimacy.  Exploring  forum disparities  through the  lens  of legitimacy  enriches  our  understanding  of the  sources  of federal criminal power. And the policymaking implications are surprising and counterintuitive:  by distilling the sources  of  federal  legitimacy,  we see the need for more localized criminal justice.",cover_heinonline,Ouziel - 2013 - Legitimacy and Federal Criminal Enforcement Power.pdf,pdf_first_page

## THE COURT AND OVERCRIMINALIZATION,cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  both Bond v.  United Statesi and  Yates  v.  United States, 2 the  Supreme Court  reversed  federal  criminal  convictions.  Neither  defendant's  conduct  was constitutionally  protected;  there  were  no procedural  irregularities  in  either  trial, no  vagueness  or  overbreadth  issues,  and  no  police  misconduct.  Instead,  each case  involved  prosecuting  a  small-time  individual with  a  big-time  statute: In Bond, the  federal  government  used the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention  Implementation  Act  of  19983  against  a  ""jilted wife."" 4 In Yates, it unleashed  the  Sar banes-Oxley  Act  of  20025  on  a  mischievous fisherman. 6 Both  proceedings raised  concerns  about  overcriminalization that implicitly  drove  the  Court's analysis in  a new  direction.",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Here,  overcriminalization means  overlapping statutes,  excessive punishments,  and  harsh  ""enforcement  of petty  violations."" 7 Dissenting  in Yates, Justice  Kagan  chastised  the  plurality  for  allowing  concerns  with  overcriminalization  to  override  accepted  statutory  interpretation  techniques: she  argued  that judges  should  channel  their  frustration  with  an  overly  punitive  legislature  towards  ""lectures .... law review articles,  and ... dicta,""  instead  of letting it corrupt  their  legal  reasoning. 8 She  was  right,  in  part: this Essay  suggests  that Bond's majority,  along  with Yates's plurality  and concurrence,  envisioned-or at  least  practiced-a  more  active  judicial  role  in  curbing  overcriminalization.

"struction,  which  might be called  the  overcriminalization  canon  (more precisely, an  anti-overcriminalization  canon),  and which might be justified on due process grounds.",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The  overcriminalization canon  is  triggered  when  the  government  prosecutes  an individual  for a  single  act (or course  of conduct)  under a criminal  statute  whose  main  purpose  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  defendant's  conduct,  yet which  contains  broadly  worded  provisions  with  words  that,  read  literally, encompass  it. The  canon  applies  when  the government  is  demanding  years  of incarceration  for  a  far-from-deadly criminal  act:  either  it is  piling  on,  adding  a federal  charge  when  traditionally  a  state  one  would  suffice,  or  it is  criminalizing  what  would normally  be  a  civil  infraction. The  canon  effects  a  broadening of the usual  statutory  analysis,  allowing the  defendant to overcome  text that appears  unambiguous  on its face, and imposes  some  sort of heightened  burden  on the  government,  requiring  it to  prove  that Congress  really  meant to  criminalize the  conduct  at issue  through the  particular  statute. 9",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"More  specifically,  the  apparent  doctrine  forming  the  overcriminalization canon  has two  components.  The  Court  begins  by  identifying  two  disconnects: that  between  a  statute's narrow-sounding  title  and extremely  broad language  in specific  provisions,  and  that between  the  common,  man-on-the-street  meaning of a  phrase  and the  government's proposed  reading  of it. The  Court then  uses these disconnects  to find ambiguity  in a key term,  even if the term is defined by the  statute  (as  in Bond) 1 0 or  the  term  is  frequently  used  and  interpreted  as a legal  term  of  art (as in Yates). 11",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Whether an  overcriminalization  canon would serve  as  a legitimate  countermajoritarian  check  on  a  retributive  Congress  or  an  instance  of judicial  overreach  is  a difficult  issue.  However, this  Essay concludes  by  suggesting  that  due process  values  might justify  it:  this  argument  would  require  reconsidering  the fairness  of criminal  law's ignorance-of-the-law-is-no-excuse maxim in  light of the  mind-boggling  volume  of  federal  administrative  regulations  and  legislation.  12",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The statute explicitly  encompasses both  the  chemicals  at  issue-toxic chemicals-and the defendant's use of them-intending to  hann another. 2 1 Yet for Chief Justice  Roberts  (here,  writing for  the Court),  the  ""exceptional  convergence""  of three  factors required  reversal  of the  conviction. 22 These factors  were (1) the  statute's definition  of ""chemical  weapon,""  which  went  beyond  the normal  meaning  of  the  phrase; 2 3 (2)  ""the  context  from  which  the  statute  arose,"" specifically  the  disconnect  between  the  defendant's harassment  that  happened to  use  chemicals  and  the  concerns  about  terrorists  employing  chemicals  in  a targeted  fashion  that  motivated  the  statute's  enactment; 24 and  (3)  federalism concerns,  because  adopting  the  government's reading  might  have  ""fundamentally  upset the  Constitution's balance  between national  and local power ' 25 given  the  ""purely  local  crimes""  at issue. 26 The  first  two-detailed  below-were the  important  factors  because  they justified  invoking  the  third:  the  Court  used the  first two  to  find  ambiguity  in the  statute's text,  and  once  the  Court had the wiggle  room  that  ambiguity  often  provides,  it  could  invoke  federalism's  clear statement  requirement""insist[ing]  on  a  clear  indication  that  Congress  meant to  reach  purely  local  crimes,  before  interpreting  the  statute's  expansive  lan-",cover_heinonline,P35HYYZ6_Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Abstract. This  Essay  argues  that  racial  reckoning  in  policing  should  include  a  racial reckoning  in the use of criminal records. Arrests alone-regardless  of  whether they result in  convictions-create  criminal  records.  Yet  because  the  literature on  criminal  records most  often focuses on  prisoner reentry and  on the consequences  of criminal  conviction, it is easy  to overlook the connections between policing decisions and collateral consequences.  This Essay  employs the  sociological  framework  of marking to show how criminal records  entrench  racial inequality  stemming  from  policing. The  marking framework  recognizes  that the government  creates  a  negative  credential  every  time it creates  a  record  of arrest  as  well  as  conviction.  Such  records,  in  turn,  trigger  cascading consequences  for  employment,  housing,  immigration,  and  a  host  of  other  areas.  The credentialing  process  matters because  it  enables and  conceals  race-based  discrimination, and  because  a  focus  on the  formal  sentence  often  renders  this discrimination  invisible. This  Essay  considers  how  adopting a  credentialing  framework  offers a  way to surface, and  ultimately to address,  how  race-based policing  leaves lasting marks  on over-policed communities.",cover_heinonline,PLX42UF4_Jain_Mark_of_Policing.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This  Essay considers  how a moment  of racial reckoning  in policing could include  a  focus  on  criminal  records.  In  the  summer  of  2020,  the  killings  of George  Floyd  and  Breonna  Taylor-coming  on  the heels  of  numerous  other documented  incidents  of police  violence  against  racial minorities-triggered  a historic  social  movement  in  the United  States. 1 One  important  insight  from this movement  is that the most visible forms of police violence  represent  only the tip of the iceberg. Police violence is  neither unpredictable  nor episodic.  It is the  product  of  a  legal  system  that  gives  the  police  enormous  control  over communities of color.",cover_heinonline,PLX42UF4_Jain_Mark_of_Policing.pdf,pdf_first_page

There is a large and growing literature  focusing on ""collateral consequences,""  but  courts  have  tended  not  to  connect  these  consequences  to arrest  practices. 2 That  may  be  because collateral  consequences tend  to  be associated with  conviction or  with  the  reentry  of  former  prisoners.

"This  Essay employs  the sociological concept  of marking to recognize  how policing  decisions entrench racial  inequality. 4  A marking framework treats an arrest  or  conviction as  a  form  of  public  credentialing. The  credentialing process  matters  because  it  translates  a  particular  experience  into  a  formally recognized status.  For  example, an  individual  could  receive  a  world-class education  through  her  public  library,  but without  the  credential  of a  degree, she  would  struggle  to  formalize  that  knowledge  and  demonstrate  its  value. Similarly, a  criminal  record  formalizes  the  experience  of  being  arrested.  It translates  a  single  police  officer's  decision  to  arrest  into  a  marker  that  has lasting social meaning.",cover_heinonline,PLX42UF4_Jain_Mark_of_Policing.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Framing a criminal record as  a negative  credential  offers a way to visualize more  expansive  legal  interventions  than  focusing  on convictions  alone.  The key  questions  under  a  marking  framework  relate  to  why,  when,  and  how negative  credentials  are  made  and  used.  The  credentialing  framework  also reveals  that not all credentials have the same social  meaning.

"In  both Bond v.  United Statesi and  Yates  v.  United States, 2 the  Supreme Court  reversed  federal  criminal  convictions.  Neither  defendant's  conduct  was constitutionally  protected;  there  were  no procedural  irregularities  in  either  trial, no  vagueness  or  overbreadth  issues,  and  no  police  misconduct.  Instead,  each case  involved  prosecuting  a  small-time  individual with  a  big-time  statute: In Bond, the  federal  government  used the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention  Implementation  Act  of  19983  against  a  ""jilted wife."" 4 In Yates, it unleashed  the  Sar banes-Oxley  Act  of  20025  on  a  mischievous fisherman. 6 Both  proceedings raised  concerns  about  overcriminalization that implicitly  drove  the  Court's analysis in  a new  direction.",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page

"struction,  which  might be called  the  overcriminalization  canon  (more precisely, an  anti-overcriminalization  canon),  and which might be justified on due process grounds.",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The  overcriminalization canon  is  triggered  when  the  government  prosecutes  an individual  for a  single  act (or course  of conduct)  under a criminal  statute  whose  main  purpose  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  defendant's  conduct,  yet which  contains  broadly  worded  provisions  with  words  that,  read  literally, encompass  it. The  canon  applies  when  the government  is  demanding  years  of incarceration  for  a  far-from-deadly criminal  act:  either  it is  piling  on,  adding  a federal  charge  when  traditionally  a  state  one  would  suffice,  or  it is  criminalizing  what  would normally  be  a  civil  infraction. The  canon  effects  a  broadening of the usual  statutory  analysis,  allowing the  defendant to overcome  text that appears  unambiguous  on its face, and imposes  some  sort of heightened  burden  on the  government,  requiring  it to  prove  that Congress  really  meant to  criminalize the  conduct  at issue  through the  particular  statute. 9",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"More  specifically,  the  apparent  doctrine  forming  the  overcriminalization canon  has two  components.  The  Court  begins  by  identifying  two  disconnects: that  between  a  statute's narrow-sounding  title  and extremely  broad language  in specific  provisions,  and  that between  the  common,  man-on-the-street  meaning of a  phrase  and the  government's proposed  reading  of it. The  Court then  uses these disconnects  to find ambiguity  in a key term,  even if the term is defined by the  statute  (as  in Bond) 1 0 or  the  term  is  frequently  used  and  interpreted  as a legal  term  of  art (as in Yates). 11",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Whether an  overcriminalization  canon would serve  as  a legitimate  countermajoritarian  check  on  a  retributive  Congress  or  an  instance  of judicial  overreach  is  a difficult  issue.  However, this  Essay concludes  by  suggesting  that  due process  values  might justify  it:  this  argument  would  require  reconsidering  the fairness  of criminal  law's ignorance-of-the-law-is-no-excuse maxim in  light of the  mind-boggling  volume  of  federal  administrative  regulations  and  legislation.  12",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The statute explicitly  encompasses both  the  chemicals  at  issue-toxic chemicals-and the defendant's use of them-intending to  hann another. 2 1 Yet for Chief Justice  Roberts  (here,  writing for  the Court),  the  ""exceptional  convergence""  of three  factors required  reversal  of the  conviction. 22 These factors  were (1) the  statute's definition  of ""chemical  weapon,""  which  went  beyond  the normal  meaning  of  the  phrase; 2 3 (2)  ""the  context  from  which  the  statute  arose,"" specifically  the  disconnect  between  the  defendant's harassment  that  happened to  use  chemicals  and  the  concerns  about  terrorists  employing  chemicals  in  a targeted  fashion  that  motivated  the  statute's  enactment; 24 and  (3)  federalism concerns,  because  adopting  the  government's reading  might  have  ""fundamentally  upset the  Constitution's balance  between national  and local power ' 25 given  the  ""purely  local  crimes""  at issue. 26 The  first  two-detailed  below-were the  important  factors  because  they justified  invoking  the  third:  the  Court  used the  first two  to  find  ambiguity  in the  statute's text,  and  once  the  Court had the wiggle  room  that  ambiguity  often  provides,  it  could  invoke  federalism's  clear statement  requirement""insist[ing]  on  a  clear  indication  that  Congress  meant to  reach  purely  local  crimes,  before  interpreting  the  statute's  expansive  lan-",cover_heinonline,Pierce_2015_The Court and Overcriminalization.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Recent  Presidents have  claimed  wide-ranging authority to  decline enforcement of  federal  laws.  The  Obama Administration, for  example, has announced  policies  of abstaining  from investigation  and  prosecution  of certain federal  marijuana  crimes, postponing enforcement  of key  provisions of  the Affordable Care Act, and suspending  enforcement of removal statutes  against certain  undocumented  immigrants.  While these  examples  highlight  how exercises of executive enforcement discretion-the  authority  to turn a blind eye to  legal violations-may effectively  reshape federal policy, prior scholarship has offered  no  satisfactory  account of the proper scope of, and constitutional basis  for, this  putative  executive  authority.  This Article fills that  gap.",cover_heinonline,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Through close  examination of the  Constitution's  text,  structure,  and normative underpinnings, as well  as relevant historical  practice,  this Article demonstrates that constitutional  authority  for enforcement discretion  existsbut  it  is  both  limited  and  defeasible. Presidents may  properly decline  to enforce  civil  and criminal  prohibitions in particular  cases, notwithstanding their obligation under  the  Take  Care  Clause  to  ensure  that  ""the  Laws  be faithfully  executed."" Congress  also  may  expand  the scope  of  executive enforcement  discretion by authorizing broader nonenforcement.  But  absent such  congressional authorization, the  President's  nonenforcement  authority extends  neither to prospective licensing of prohibited conduct nor to policybased  nonenforcement  of  federal  laws  for entire  categories of  offenders. Presuming such  forms  of  executive  discretion  would  collide  with  another deeply rooted constitutional  tradition:  the principle  that American Presidents,",cover_heinonline,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Enforcement  discretion-the  authority  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to legal violations-is central to the operation of  both the federal criminal justice system and the administrative state. Yet its constitutional  underpinnings  are surprisingly  unclear.  Courts  and the executive  branch  have  described  such  discretion,  particularly  in  the criminal  context,  as  a  core  executive authority.' But  the  Take  Care Clause-the  constitutional  provision  most  often  invoked  to  support this assertion-suggests  the opposite: by providing that the  President ""shall  take  Care  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully  executed,"" it  seems  to require  the  President  to  fully  enforce  all  congressional  enactments. 2 Meanwhile, numerous recent controversies have highlighted the importance of  the issue. Under  President  Obama, the  executive branch announced policies of abstaining from investigating and prosecuting certain federal marijuana offenses in states where possession  of  the  drug  is  legal 3 and  delaying  for  substantial  periods the enforcement  of key  provisions of the Affordable  Care Act (""ACA""). 4 Earlier,  the Administration  adopted  a  controversial policy  of declining to  seek  removal  of  certain  sympathetic  undocumented  immigrants who entered the United States as young children. 5  The Administration",cover_heinonline,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Although  President  Obama's policies  have  sparked  particular controversy, his actions are not  unique. In  fact, the  practice of executive  policymaking through nonenforcement  stretches back  across recent  administrations.  One  commentator  accused  President  George W. Bush,  for example,  of pursuing  an agenda of ""deregulation through nonenforcement."" 7 The  reasons  for  increasing  executive  reliance  on nonenforcement, moreover, may  well  be structural.  In an  era  of presidential  administration  and  partisan  gridlock,  when  the  public holds  the  President  accountable for  failures of  national  policy  yet Congress cannot be relied upon  to develop legislative solutions, executive  officials  are  prone  to  adopt  an  expansive  understanding  of their  authorities.  Nonenforcement may  be  a  particularly  attractive policy  tool.  Since  it  benefits  some  and  penalizes  no  one,  statutory nonenforcement  may permit Presidents to  effectively  amend statutory policies, at least for the  duration of  their  presidencies, without provoking  focused  political  opposition.  But  executive  nonenforcement authority, if unbounded,  could substantially reorder the  Constitution's separation  of  powers  framework. By permitting  Presidents  to  read laws,  both  old  and  new,  out  of  the  Code  for  the  duration  of  their presidencies, unrestricted enforcement discretion could provide Presidents with a  sort of second veto-an  authority to remake  the  law on the ground  without asking Congress to revise  the law on the books. Developing  a  clear  understanding  of  the  proper  scope  of  executive enforcement  discretion  and  the  executive  branch's  law-enforcement duties is therefore  imperative.",cover_heinonline,Price - 2014 - Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty.pdf,pdf_first_page

"History  makes  a fleeting appearance  in  recent debates  about  reforming  the prosecutor's office. Opponents of  the  way discretion is  currently exercised often contend  that  because  a prosecutor is a public  servant, he ought to protect defendants' rights as  well  as  convict the  guilty.' When  this position is  couched  in historical terms, it appeals to  a  prosecutorial self-image, purportedly rooted in  the past, to  promote  fairness and  to  curtail the  excesses of  the adversary system. Bruce Green asserts, for example, that the  ""prosecutor's duty  to  'seek justice' . . . . dates back  well  over  a  century."" 2 Advocates  of  victims' rights and  the  re-privatization of criminal justice also tend to  assume  that private prosecution in  early America  gave way to  impartial, or  even defendant-protective, government  control. 3  This  com-",cover_heinonline,Ramsey - 2002 - The Discretionary Power of Public Prosecutors in Historical Perspective.pdf,pdf_first_page

## Some Doubts About 'Democratizing' Criminal Justice,cover_jstor,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The American criminal justice system's ills are by now so familiar as scarcely to bear repeating: unprecedented levels of incarceration, doled out disproportionately across racial groups, and police that seem to antagonize and hurt the nowdistrustful communities they are tasked to serve and protect. Systemic social ailments like these seldom permit straightforward diagnoses, let alone simple cures. In this case, however, a large, diverse, and influential group of experts-the legal academy's 'democratizers'-all identify the same disease: the retreat of local democratic control in favor of a bureaucratic 'machinery' disconnected from public values and the people themselves. Neighborhood juries, for example, internalize the costs of punishing their own; neighborhood police, 'of' and answerable to the community, think twice before drawing their weapons or stopping a local boy on a hunch. The experts and detached professionals who populate our dominant bureaucratic institutions, in contrast, are motivated by different, less salubrious, incentives. Across the gamut of criminal justice decision-making, the democratizers maintain, the influence of the local laity is a moderating, equalizing, and ultimately legitimating one. A generous dose of participatory democracy won't solve all our problems, but it's our best shot to get the criminal justice system back on its feet.",cover_jstor,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article's warning is plain: don't take the medicine. 'Democratization' wields undeniable rhetorical appeal but will not really fix what ails us-and may just make it worse. The democratization movement, this Article argues, rests on conceptually problematic and empirically dubious premises about the makeup, preferences, and independence of local 'communities.' It relies on the proudly counterintuitive claim that laypeople are largely lenient and egalitarian, contrary to a wealth of social scientific evidence. And ultimately, democratization's dual commitments are on a collision course. The democratizers simultaneously devote themselves to particular ends-amelioration of the biased and outsized carceral state-and to particular means-participatory democracy. What happens if, as this Article predicts,",cover_jstor,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

"For the uninitiated, a brief rehearsal of the facts of the matter: The United States presently incarcerates over two million individuals, with another four million under other forms of correctional supervision. 1 The nation's imprisonment rate is the highest in the world, 2 while its crime rates are about average. 3 One-third of American inmates are black. 4 One in three black males in the United States will be incarcerated before he dies. 5 Figures like these are far out of line with national population demographics and do not simply reflect differential rates of offending across racial groups. 6 These 'twin problems'-'overall severity' and 'disparate treatment of African-Americans' 7 -plague American policing as well. American law enforcement officers killed over 1,100 individuals in 2017, more than 300 of them black. 8 From 2004 to 2012 in New York City alone, police conducted 4.4 million pedestrian stops, targeting black individuals more than half the time. 9",cover_jstor,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Given broad academic consensus on these points, the pressing questions are how we got here and, especially, how we can get out. Theories proliferate. Notably, though, a diverse and accomplished group of scholars, following different intellectual paths, have recently converged upon the same basic conclusion. The retreat of local democratic control over criminal justice, these writers argue, precipitated the system's collapse; to reverse course, reformers must curb the influence of bureaucrats and redirect power to local communities to stimulate 'bottom-up populism.' 12 Aspects of this account have a decidedly counterintuitive cast: they require us to accept that politically liberal reforms to professionalize police and prosecutors, protect minority rights, and ensure equality of punishment across defendants had unintended and ultimately perverse effects. Yet however counterintuitive the theory may have been at its inception, the notion that we ought to 'trad[e] a good deal of expertise for a little democracy,' wrote Professor David Sklansky in 2008, 'probably reflects the general view among scholars today.' 13",cover_jstor,Rappaport - 2020 - Some doubts about democratizing criminal justice.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This Article seeks to  describe the dynamics of interaction  between  federal prosecutors  and  federal  enforcement agents, and to suggest how these dynamics affect  the exercise of enforcement  discretion.  After considering  the virtues and pitfalls of both  hierarchical  and coordinate organizational  modes,  the Article  offers  a normative model  that views prosecutors  and agents as members of a ""working  group,"" with each side  monitoring  the other. It concludes by  exploring  how this model can  be furthered  or  frustrated  with various  procedural and structural  changes.",cover_heinonline,Richman - 2003 - Prosecutors and Their Agents_ Agents and Their Prosecutors.pdf,pdf_first_page

"In  September 2017, the  University  of California  Regents  spearheaded  a  major  programmatic  challenge  to  a U.S. Department  of Homeland Security initiative under  the Administrative Procedure Act of  1946 (APA).' Because the APA directs  courts to  review the  legality  of agency action  upon ""the  whole  record,"" 2 the government  filed what  it deemed  to be  the  complete  administrative  record  of all  non-deliberative  documents considered by the  agency  when  it  undertook  the  challenged  initiative. 3 The plaintiffs  responded by arguing the  record was  missing thousands  of pages  of documents. The  plaintiffs  moved  the  court  to  order  the  Department of Homeland  Security  to complete  the  administrative  record.'",cover_heinonline,Rosenthal_2003_Policing and Equal Protection.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Just  five  weeks  after  the lawsuit  was  filed, a  federal  district  judge 6 granted  the  plaintiffs' motion. Despite  later  acknowledging  that ""[t]he Supreme  Court has  never  defined  'the whole  record'  in the  context  of informal  agency  action""-the  kind  of agency  action  at  issue  there 7 -the judge  found  that  the  government  did  not  file  a  complete  record.' The court  gave  the  government  a  mere  ten  days  to  complete  the  record  with, among  other things,  ""all  emails,  letters,  memoranda,  notes,  media  items, opinions  and  other materials  directly  or indirectly  considered  in the  final agency  decision,""  including  all  materials  considered by a  cabinet  secretary  and anyone  who gave  the  secretary  written  or oral  input. 9 The  court of appeals  agreed.' 0",cover_heinonline,Rosenthal_2003_Policing and Equal Protection.pdf,pdf_first_page
"But  the  proper  scope  of the  record  was  an  important  enough  issue that the U.S. Supreme  Court weighed  in with stunning  alacrity-less  than two  months  after  the  district  court  issued  its  order-deciding  to  stay the district  court's order over  a vigorous dissent  regarding  the proper  composition  of  the  administrative  record.""

"American cities are under  attack. The last  few years have witnessed an explosion of preemptive legislation challenging and overriding municipal ordinances  across  a wide range  ofpolicy areas.  State-city conflicts over the municipal  minimum wage, LGBT antidiscrimination,  and  sanctuary  city laws have garnered  the most attention, but these conflicts are representative  of  a larger trend  toward state  aggrandizement.  These legal  challenges  to municipal regulation  have been accompanied by an increasingly  shrill anticity politics, emanating  from  both state and  federal officials.  This Article describes this  politics by way of  assessing  the nature  of-and reasons  forthe  hostility  to  city  lawmaking.  It  argues that anti-urbanism is  a  longstanding  and  enduring feature  of  American  federalism  and  seeks to understand  how a constitutional  system  overtly dedicated  to the principles  of devolution can be so hostile to the exercise of municipal  power.  The Article also provides a  current accounting of state preemptive  legislation and assesses  the cities 'potential  legal and  political  defenses. It concludes that, without a significant  rethinking  ofstate-based federalism, the American city is likely to remain  vulnerable.",cover_heinonline,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf,pdf_first_page

"American cities  are under  attack.  The  last few years  have witnessed an explosion of  preemptive state legislation challenging and overriding municipal  ordinances across  a  wide  range  of  policy  areas. These  legal challenges to municipal regulation have been accompanied by an increasingly  shrill  anti-urban  politics.  Anti-city  rhetoric  suffused  the 2016 presidential  election,  during which  the  Republican  candidate  for  President, Donald  Trump,  painted  a portrait  of American  cities  as  violent,  decaying, depraved,  and  corrupt.' As  President, Trump  has  repeatedly  decried  the actions  of  so-called  ""sanctuary cities""-those  cities  that  have  refused  to comply with federal  immigration mandates or have resisted cooperating with",cover_heinonline,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The  federal  threat to  sanctuary  cities,  however,  is  a  small  piece  of the overall  legal  assault  on  cities,  which  emanates  mostly  from the  states  and goes  well  beyond  immigration  policy.  As  a  federal  constitutional  matter, states  exercise plenary power over their political subdivisions.  Even in states that provide  for some measure  of  constitutional  ""home rule"" protection, cities are  usually not  immune from contrary  state commands.",cover_heinonline,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Recent state legislative  actions intended  to  ""rein in"" wayward cities are illustrative.  In  response  to  assertions by some  local  officials  in Texas  that they would  not  cooperate with federal  authorities in  enforcing federal immigration laws, the Texas Legislature  adopted  SB4,  which bars  cities and local  officials  from adopting  any  ordinance,  rule,  or practice  that  limits the enforcement  of  federal  immigration  laws  on  threat  of  criminal  and  civil penalties  and  removal  from office.' The  Arizona  Legislature  has adopted  a law that requires the Attorney General to investigate  local laws at the request of any  state  legislator and  withhold  state  funds  where  a  local  law  conflicts with  state  law. 6 Michigan  adopted  legislation  that  bars  local  governments from  regulating  paid  sick  days,  wages, scheduling,  and  hours  or  benefits disputes.' In North  Carolina, the  state  legislature  adopted  a  ""bathroom bill"" that was  designed  to  strike  down  local transgender  civil  rights  ordinances. 8 Before  it  was  repealed,  the  same  law  also  preempted  municipal  minimum wage, contracting,  employment  discrimination,  and public-accommodations ordinances. 9",cover_heinonline,Schragger - 2017 - The Attack on American Cities.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Most criminal prosecutions are  settled without a  trial.' The parties to  these settlements trade various risks and  entitlements: the  defendant relinquishes the right to  go to  trial (along with  any  chance  of  acquittal), while  the  prosecutor gives up  the  entitlement to  seek the  highest sentence or  pursue the  most  serious charges  possible. The resulting bargains differ predictably from what  would have  happened  had  the same cases been  taken to  trial. Defendants who bargain for a  plea  serve lower  sentences than  those who do not. 2  On the  other hand, everyone  who  pleads  guilty is, by definition, convicted, while  a substantial minority of  those who go to  trial are  acquitted. 3",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page

"process, including (perhaps especially) the courts, seem  remarkably untroubled by  it. Not  only  is  the  practice widespread, but  participants generally approve of  it. 5 Why  is  plea  bargaining at  once  so widely  condemned  and  so widely tolerated?",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page
"One place to  look  for an  answer  is in  the law  and  literature of plea bargaining  as  contract. Plea  bargains are, as  the  name  suggests, bargains; it seems natural to  argue  that they  should  be  regulated and  evaluated accordingly. But while that argument is common, there is little agreement on  where  it leads. Two of the  harshest and  most  influential critics of  plea bargaining, Albert Alschuler and  Stephen Schulhofer, maintain that contract theory supports prohibiting any bargained-for allocation of criminal punishment. 6 The  courts, on  the other hand, have  proceeded to  construct a  body  of  contract-based law  to  regulate the plea bargaining process, taking for granted the efficiency and  decency  of the process being  regulated. The many  academic arguments  for  abolishing (or  at  least severely restricting) plea  bargaining have thus  been largely ignored. It  is tempting to  explain this reaction as  a  product  of the  chasm between  an  overly fastidious academic world and the  unpleasant realities of  modem criminal processes. But  the  intuition that plea bargaining is  fundamentally flawed  is too strong and  too  widespread to  be  so  casually dismissed.",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page
"There  is a  better explanation for the  tension between  courts and  practitioners on  the one  hand,  and  theorists on  the  other: plea bargains are both paradigmatic  bargains of  the  sort  we routinely enforce  in  other  contexts and the product of  a  seriously flawed  bargaining structure. The critics, for their part, have  misused or  misapplied classical contract arguments for limiting contractual autonomy.  Properly understood, classical contract theory supports the freedom to  bargain over  criminal punishment. At  the  same time, there are  fundamental structural impediments  in  the  plea  bargaining context that may underlie the widespread antipathy to  the  practice. These  barriers to  efficient bargaining are not, however, grounds  for abolition, but  instead suggest more focused reforms of  current practices.",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page

But  there is a  major  differeice between  popular and  academic  attitudes: while  the academics  tend  to  dislike plea  bargaining because  it treats defendants unfairly, the  public tends to  see the  practice as  treating defendants too  leniently.

"In  Part I  of this Article, we use  the  perspective of  classical contract theory to  evaluate the  case  for prohibiting plea bargaining. This  analysis shows that none  of  the  standard arguments  for limiting contractual autonomy hold  in  the plea bargaining context. Those  standard arguments  focus  either on  a  defective bargaining process or  on systematically unfair or  distributionally unjust outcomes. But  the  contemporary  plea  bargaining process  actually exceeds  the process  standards we apply  to  other sorts of  bargaining, and the  outcomes, while  far from perfect, are  also  far removed from the kinds  of problems  that would ordinarily lead to  a  limitation of  contractual autonomy.",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  Part H, we use  the techniques of  modem  decision analysis and  bargaining  theory to  analyze the strategic interaction of  parties to  plea  bargains. This approach  suggests that the  core  objection to  plea bargaining is not  intrinsic to the relationship, but  structural: strategic impediments  to  efficient bargains lead to  a  pooling of  guilty and  innocent defendants. The pooling phenomenon leads predictably to  innocent defendants being  offered (and  taking) the  same deals as  guilty ones.",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  Part III, we consider the  implications of  this analysis for legal doctrine. We  argue  that abolishing plea  bargaining would not  solve, and might  even aggravate, the  problem  of  failing to  separate the  innocent from  the  guilty. But abolition is  not the  only  possibility-though it is the  only one  that has  received sustained academic  attention. Indeed, the  single-minded academic  focus  on abolition may have  contributed to  a  second-order problem:  the development  of legal doctrine that makes strategic bargaining problems worse  rather than better. By altering the doctrine that governs such  issues as  when and  how bargains are enforced, the consequences of defendants' mistakes, and  how background prices (i.e., post-trial sentences) are set, the state can  reduce the incentives for strategic bargaining and improve the  efficiency and fairness of  the  plea  bargaining process.",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The criminal process that law  students study and  television shows  celebrate is formal, elaborate, and  expensive. It involves detailed examination of witnesses  and  physical evidence, tough  adversarial argument  from attorneys for  the government  and  defense, and  fair-minded decisionmaking from an impartial judge  and  jury. For  the  vast majority of  cases in  the  real world, the  criminal process includes none  of these things. Trials occur only  occasionally-in some jurisdictions, they  amount  to  only  one-fiftieth of  total dispositions. 7 Most  cases are  disposed of  by  means that seem scandalously casual: a  quick  conversation in a  prosecutor's office or  a  courthouse hallway between  attorneys familiar with only  the  basics of  the  case, with  no witnesses present, leading to  a  proposed",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The  idea of  allocating criminal punishment through what  looks like a  street bazaar  has  proved  unappealing to  most  outside observers. Critics point to  the seeming  hypocrisy of using an  elaborate trial process as  window dressing, while doing  all the  real business of  the system  through the  most  unelaborate process imaginable. 9 They emphasize  the  unfairness (and  inaccuracy) of  determining defendants' fate without full investigation, without testimony and  evidence and impartial factfinding; they emphasize  too how this unfairness disproportionately harms the poor  and  unsophisticated. 0  Perhaps  especially, they  note  the  seeming  pervasiveness of  coercion and fraud  in  the  system.  Defendants  accept bargains because  of the threat of much harsher penalties after trial; they  are thus forced  to  give  up the  protections that the  trial system's many  formalities provide.""  And  judges  ofterx give  bargained-for sentences because  of  what prosecutors and defense  lawyers  do not say  at  sentencing; the  sentencing hearing seems rigged to  support the  deal  that the  two attorneys have  already struck. 1 2",cover_heinonline,Scott and Stuntz - 1991 - Plea Bargaining as Contract Symposium Punishment.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This Article presents evidence that some state  prosecutors  use their  discretion to  reduce racial  disparities  in criminal  sentences.  This finding challenges the prevailing  view  that  prosecutors  compound disparities.  Given prosecutors'positions as mediators  in a sequential  system,  this Article analyzes how prosecutors  respond  to disparities  they  inherit  from  the past-and  interprets their impacts in light of the accumulated  disparities  that  already  exist when they first  open their  case  files.  Specifically,  I estimate how  the sentencing penalty  for prior  convictions differs by  defendant race  using  North  Carolina  state  court  records  from 2010 to 2019. I  find that the increase  in the likelihood of a  prison  sentence for  an additional  prior  conviction was 25% higher  for white than  Black defendants with similar  arrests  and  criminal records. While Black and  white defendants without criminal  records were incarcerated at similar rates, white defendants with records were incarcerated  at significantly higher rates. And the longer  the record, the  greater  the divergence.",cover_heinonline,Shaffer - 2023 - Prosecutors_ Race_ and the Criminal Pipeline.pdf,pdf_first_page
"To understand  this  finding,  I  link an  original  survey of  203  prosecutors  to  their real-world  cases.  This  survey-to-case linkage helps  reveal how prosecutors'  beliefs about  past  racial  bias influence  their decision-making.  I  find that  the subset of  prosecutors who attribute  racial  disparities  in the criminal legal system  to  racial  bias have  lower prison rates for Black  defendants with criminal records than facially similar  white defendants, thereby offsetting  past disparities.",cover_heinonline,Shaffer - 2023 - Prosecutors_ Race_ and the Criminal Pipeline.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In concrete terms,  racial  disparities  in North Carolina  prison rates in 2019 would have increased  by 20% had  the state mandated  equal  treatment  of defendants with similar case files.  These findings should lead reformers to  exercise caution when considering  calls to limit  or eliminate  prosecutorial discretion.  Blinding  prosecutors to defendant race-a  policy that  jurisdictions  are increasingly  implementing may inadvertently  increase  disparities  by neutralizing  the offsetting effects  of some prosecutors. While race-blind  charging  ensures that  prosecutors  do  not introduce new bias, it also ensures that  any past bias is passed through  to current  (and future) decisions.",cover_heinonline,Shaffer - 2023 - Prosecutors_ Race_ and the Criminal Pipeline.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This Article explores the possibility of community nullification  beyond the  jury by  analyzing the  growing  and  unstudied phenomenon  of community  bail funds,  which  post  bail for strangers based  on  broader beliefs  regarding  the overuse of pretrial  detention. When  a community bail fund posts bail,  it can serve  the  function of nullifying a judge's  determination that a certain amount of the  defendant's  personal or family  money  was  necessary to ensure public safety and prevent flight.  This growing practice-what  this Article calls ""bail nullification""-is  powerful  because it exposes publicly what many within the system already know  to be  true: that although bail is ostensibly a regulatory pretrial  procedure,  for indigent defendants it often serves the function  that a real trial  might, producing  guilty pleas and longer sentences when an individual  cannot afford to pay their bail. By  examining the ways in which community  bail funds  serve  the functions  that a  nullifying jury  might-allowing popular  participation in an individual  case to facilitate larger  resistance  to  the policies and practices  of state actors-this  Article argues that community bail funds have the potential to change how  local criminal  justice systems  operate on  the ground, shifting and shaping  political and constitutional understandings of the  institution of money  bail.  Community bail funds give  a voice  to populations who  rarely have  a say  in  how  criminal  justice is administered, especially poor  people of color. And the study of  bail  funds helps point toward other ways in which bottom-up public  participation  can help create a criminal justice system  that is  truly responsive to  the communities that it is  ultimately supposed  to  serve.",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2016 - Bail Nullification.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Scholars  have  long  studied  the  power  of community  actors  to  nullify official  decisions by state actors  in the criminal justice  system.' This scholarship  analyzes  ""nullification"" as a  process  involving jurors:  when citizens  on a jury acquit  someone  despite their legal  guilt,  the jurors  make  a  potent  statement  about a  particular  defendant or law,  in the  process  transferring  power from legislatures,  judges,  and prosecutors to  a  small  group of citizens. 2 This focus  on the jury  as  a site  of nullification  is  understandable-jury  nullification  has  been  a  prominent  feature  of American  criminal  justice  since  the country's founding,  and  the  jury plays  a  singular  role  as  the  ultimate  moment of community input into  a criminal  case. 3 But the  power of the jury is waning.  In our post-trial world, fewer  than five percent  of criminal  cases end in  a trial  of  any  kind, 4 and  the  public  at  large has  little input  into  the",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2016 - Bail Nullification.pdf,pdf_first_page

"In this  Article,  I  argue  that  a  form  of community  nullification  can  and does  occur  in  the  interstices  of  pretrial  procedures  and  criminal  case  outcomes  in  the  form  of community  bail  funds.  In  recent  years,  community groups in  jurisdictions  across  the  United  States  have  increasingly  begun  to use  bail  funds  to  post bail  on  behalf of strangers,  using  a  revolving  pool of money. These  funds  include  new  charities  set  up in  partnership  with  public defender offices  in Massachusetts,' the  Bronx, 8 Brooklyn, 9 and Nashville1 0 as well  as  identity-based  bail  funds  that range  from a  bail fund  for transgender sex workers  of color  in  Queens,  New York""  to  a  bail  fund supporting  communities  of color  targeted by policing  in  Chicago, 2 and bail  funds  formed",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2016 - Bail Nullification.pdf,pdf_first_page

"A B ST  RA CT. Scholars and reformers  have in recent years  begun to imagine new  and different configurations  for  how the  state  can  design policing  institutions.  These conversations  have  increased  in volume and  urgency in response to the 2020 national  uprising against police  violence, when radical  demands  born within  social  movements  have  gained  steam-demands  to  defund the police, to  institute  ""people's budgets;' and to give  communities  control  over the state provision  of  security.  In  recent  years,  within  this time  of foment  and possibility,  social  movements have been  proposing,  creating,  and  sometimes  establishing  new  governance  arrangements  that shift power over policing to those who have  been most harmed by mass criminalization and mass incarceration.  These recent pushes by social movements  for power shifting surface  a fundamental set of questions  about the very purpose  of police reform,  adding a  new way  for scholars  and reformers  to think about  the contours  and  objectives  of the  state's provision  of safety  and security -what this Article terms  the power lens.",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2020 - Police Reform through a Power Lens.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This Article examines  the movement focus on power shifting in the governance  of the police at  both  the  local  and  national  levels.  It  fleshes  out  a  three-part  theoretical  account  of  why the power lens  is an important and necessary  addition  to how scholars  and reformers view the regulation  of policing.  First,  shifting power  to policed  populations  is  reparative,  in the sense  that it shifts  power  downward  toward populations  who  have  been  denied political  power  directly  as  a result  of the  history  of  policing policies  and practices  in  their neighborhoods.  Second,  power shifting  is  a  means  of promoting  antisubordination,  based  on  the  idea  that it is  wrong  for the state  to engage  in practices  that enforce  the  inferior social status  of historically  oppressed  groups. Third,  a power lens  on police  reform promotes  a particular view  of contestatory  democracy,  one in which  democratic  policing has  as  one  of its  objectives  the  facilitation  of countervailing  power for those  subject  to the domination  of the state.  Taken together,  the power lens  brings  a  critical eye to the ways  in which  the construction  of the notion  of ""expertise""  often denies  agency  to the people  who  most often  interact  with police  in  the streets  and on  the roads.  More  broadly,  the power lens opens  up discussions  of reform to first-order questions  about how the state should go about providing safety and security in our time,  with or without the police as we know it.",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2020 - Police Reform through a Power Lens.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The demands that emerged amid the 2020 uprisings  against police violence and white supremacy  brought into the national  consciousness  radical ideas  for change in how the state  should provide  safety  and security.  There  are demands to  defund the police,  to  have  the people  decide  how  budgets  are  allocated,  and to give communities  control  over how to define public safety.  To look back just one year  is to see  how these visions  are  the product of long-term  organizing by directly  impacted  people -especially Black,  Latinx,  and  Indigenous  peoplepushing to create  new visions  of how to keep each other safe.  In June 2019, for instance,  Black Lives  Matter  Chicago  and other  local  groups  held  a  press  conference  to condemn the killing by Chicago Police  Department  (CPD) officers  of five  people of color in the previous  thirty days.  The  activists  issued a  call  to  action,  summarized  in this  tweet:  ""Defund,  Disarm,  Disrupt  CPD  and business as  usual.  #FightBack  #CPACNow.""I  The last hashtag  references  a bill  that had been  recently  reintroduced  in  the  Chicago  City  Council  to  form  the  Civilian Police Accountability Council  (CPAC),  which would consist of civilians  chosen through  elections  in  each  neighborhood  district. 2 As  the  activists  supporting the  bill  have  written:  ""Without taking  power  away  from  the  police  and the state  systems  that operate  in  complicity,  nothing will  change.  We  need  community in  control.  It is  our  democratic  right."" 3  When protests  erupted on the streets  of Chicago  in May  and June  of 2020, people were ready with their transformational  demands.  ""CPAC  NOW""  became  a  ubiquitous  sign  and  chant,",cover_heinonline,Simonson - 2020 - Police Reform through a Power Lens.pdf,pdf_first_page

"The key  to  the growing  prominence of  prosecutors, both in the  United States and elsewhere,  lies in  the prosecutor's  preeminent  ability to bridge organizational  and conceptual  divides in criminal  justice. Above  all else, prosecutors  are  mediating  figures, straddling  the  frontiers  between adversarial  and inquisitorial justice, between the police and the courts, and between  law  and discretion. By blurring these boundaries, prosecutors provide the criminal  justice  system  with three different kinds offlexibilityideological, institutional, and operational-and  they strengthen their own hands in a legal culture  that increasingly  disfavors institutional  rigidity and hard-and-fast  commitments. At  the same time,  though,  the mediating role of the prosecutor  frustrates traditional  strategies  for holding government accountable. The  bridges  that prosecutors provide-between  law  and politics, rules and discretion, courts and  police,  advocacy and  objectivitymake  curtailing  prosecutorial  power and taming prosecutorial  discretion trickier business  than  is  often  suggested,  or  at  least a  different  kind  of business.",cover_heinonline,Sklansky - 2016 - The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power Criminology.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Much  of what  is  wrong  with  American criminal  justice-its  racial inequity, its  excessive severity,  its  propensity  for  error-is  increasingly blamed  on  prosecutors.' Moreover,  prosecutors seem  to  be  getting  ever more powerful,  not just  in  the  United  States,  but  in much of the  rest  of the world  as  well. 2 The  nature  of prosecutorial  power  and  the  reasons  for its growth remain murky,  though. As a result,  it  is hard to  know  exactly  what to  make  of prosecutors  or  what  we  should  expect  from  them. There  is plenty  of thoughtful,  well-informed  scholarship  on  prosecutors,  especially in the  United  States, but  most of this work is self-consciously  pragmatic. It takes the  modem prosecutor's office  as a given, a dragon that we find living in  our  midst  and  wish  to  tame. My goal  here  is  slightly different,  less immediately  reformist. I want  to step  back and  try  to  understand  the dragon: what  kind of animal it is and why it is with us.",cover_heinonline,Sklansky - 2016 - The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power Criminology.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The  haze  surrounding  prosecutors  is  both  descriptive  and  conceptual. On  the  descriptive  side,  we know  much  less  about  prosecutors  than  we  do about the  other main  officials  in the  criminal justice system: judges and  the police. Unlike judges,  prosecutors  generally  do  not announce  the  grounds for their  decisions-or  even,  often,  the  fact that they have  made  a decision. And  unlike  the  police,  prosecutors  carry  out  most  of their  work  behind closed  doors.  Although  law enforcement  remains in many ways a  secretive occupation,  the  bulk of patrol  work is  necessarily  done  in public,  and  it has become  common over the  past half-century  for large  police  departments  to",cover_heinonline,Sklansky - 2016 - The Nature and Function of Prosecutorial Power Criminology.pdf,pdf_first_page

"This  Article  draws  on prison  abolitionist  organizing,  campaigns,  and  intellectual  work  around the  country  to  offer  a  framework  for  thinking  about  radical  reforms  rooted  in  an  abolitionist framework. A radical  reform  (1)  shrinks the system  doing harm; (2)  relies  on modes  of political, economic,  and  social  organization  that  contradict  prevailing  arrangements  and  gesture  at  new possibilities;  (3)  builds and shifts  power into the hands  of those  directly impacted, who are  often Black,  brown, working class, and poor;  (4)  acknowledges  and repairs  past harm;  and (5)  improves, or at least  does  not  harm, the material  conditions  of directly  impacted  people. After laying  out the  framework,  the Article  examines  three  reforms:  body  cameras,  ""progressive  prosecutors,"" and  reparations. While  we  agree  with  abolitionist  organizers that  no  singular  reform  can fundamentally  transform political,  economic, and social relations, abolitionist frameworks create space  to collectively  agitate  on  the  role  of reform  in transformational,  rather  than  legitimating, projects.",cover_heinonline,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Amid  the 2020  uprisings  that began  in  response  to  the  Minneapolis  Police Department's  murder of George  Floyd,  ""defund  and  dismantle  the  police"" emerged as the demands from the streets.  These demands were echoed and etched by protestors in every major city across the country. Only five years  earlier,  after the mass protests following the police killings of  Eric Garner, Michael  Brown, and Freddie Gray,  the most visible  protest demands  included  ""stop killing us"" or the criminal prosecution of individual police officers.  The shift toward demands that seek to dismantle  and defund underlined  the growing power of prison abolitionist organizing. 1 Abolitionist demands have become a terrain for reimagining social, political,  and  economic life.  They are tools for organizing constituencies  around bold ways  of responding  to  today's  crises  of racial  capitalism  and colonialism, including police violence, incarceration, deportation, and the global pandemic.  In their  focus  on  fundamentally  altering  the  structures  that  govern  our  society, abolitionist  demands  present  a  direct  challenge  to  conventional  liberal  reform strategies and offer the possibility of political, economic, and social transformation. 2",cover_heinonline,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In this Article, we examine  the radical visions emerging from abolitionist organizing. Abolitionist  campaigns  often identify  the  carceral  state  as  a  root source  of violence and  inequality, and  assert  the  road  to  a  more  free  and sustainable future lays within its undoing. 3 We explore abolitionist frameworks for thinking about demands that aim to shrink and delegitimize the prison industrial complex (PIC) -which includes police-in service of  moving away from a society focused on punishment to one rooted in collective care and social provision.  While we are under no illusion that abolitionist frameworks  are perfect or complete-or that there is any one blueprint for transformation-we  believe  abolition is key to building a more just world.  In calling for an end to carceral systems, economies,",cover_heinonline,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf,pdf_first_page

"A grounding  in abolitionist demands  highlights the failure  of conventional modes  of  reform  to  mitigate the  scale of  state  and  market  violence and exploitation. 4 Developing  alternate  horizons  and  frameworks  is  essential  to advancing  demands  that  make  possible  the  political,  economic,  and social transformation that  so  many  of  us  deem  necessary. As  movements  have popularized prison abolition as a framework for wholesale transformation,  others have coopted  the language  of abolition to  continue  to push conventional  reform agendas. This  Article lays  out  a  framework  for  radical  reforms rooted  in abolitionist organizing and then considers specific reforms through the framework.",cover_heinonline,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Barbara Jordan, one of  the founders of  the Combahee River Collective and a  leading  thinker in the  Black Feminist  movement,  writes that ""[t]he assaults from  the  present  system  necessitate  that most activists  work for  reforms,  but those of  us who are radicals understand that it is possible to do so at the very same time that we work for fundamental change-a revolution."" 5 From the Movement for  Black Lives  to  the  Democratic  Socialists  of America,  groups  organizing  for radical change today are engaged in questions of  policy and reform.  To believe that we can both work toward fundamental change while simultaneously engaging in incremental reform efforts requires that we identify what reforms move us toward transformational change, or at least those that do not move us away from it.",cover_heinonline,Stahly-Butts and Akbar - 2021 - Reforms for Radicals An Abolitionist Framework.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Substantive  criminal  law  defines  the  conduct  that  the  state  punishes.  Or does it?  If the  answer is yes,  it should be possible, by reading criminal codes  (perhaps  with a few  case annotations  thrown in),  to tell what conduct will land you in prison.  Most discussions  of criminal  law, whether  in  law  reviews,  law  school  classrooms,  or  the  popular  press, proceed  on  the  premise  that  the  answer is yes. 1 Law  reform  movements  regularly  seek  to  broaden  or  narrow  the  scope  of  some  set  of criminal liability rules,  always on  the assumption  that by  doing so they will  broaden  or narrow  the  range  of behavior  that is  punished.  Opponents  of these movements  operate  on the  same assumption -that  the law determines  who goes to prison  and  who doesn't, that  the  distribution of criminal punishment  tracks criminal law as it is defined by code books  and  case  reports.  Of  course,  participants  in  these  debates  understand  that  the  law  does  not by  itself determine  who  is  and  isn't punished.  Some  criminals  evade detection,  police and prosecutors  frequently  decline  to  arrest  or  charge,  and  juries  sometimes refuse  to convict.  Still,  if  the  literature  on  criminal  law  is  an accurate  gauge,  all that  is just  a gloss on  the  basic  picture,  a modification  but  not  a negation of the claim that criminal law drives criminal punishment.",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"But  criminal  law  does not  drive  criminal  punishment.  It would  be closer to the  truth to say  that criminal punishment  drives criminal  law. The  definition of  crimes  and  defenses plays  a  different  and  much smaller  role  in  the  allocation  of criminal  punishment  than  we  usually suppose.  In  general,  the  role  it  plays is  to  empower  prosecutors,  who are  the  criminal  justice  system's real  lawmakers.  Anyone  who  reads",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"1.  For  a fascinating recent example, see Paul Robinson's comparative study of American criminal codes.  Paul H.  Robinson et al., The  Five  Worst (and Five Best)  American Criminal  Codes, 95 Nw. U. L. REV. 1 (2000). Robinson emphasizes both the comprehensiveness  and the  clarity of criminal codes'  descriptions of  prohibited conduct,  on the ground that clearly  defined crimes  send better signals  to  the public  at large  than ambiguously  defined  crimes. See  id. at 6-11; see  also Paul H.  Robinson, Structuring Criminal Codes to  Perform Their Function, 4  BUFF.  CRIM.  L.  REV.  1  (2000)  [hereinafter  Robinson, Structuring  Criminal Codes] (defending  the  use  of criminal  codes  to  educate  the  public  as  to  its legal obligations).  These  criteria make  sense  only  if  the  codes'  descriptions in  fact  capture the conduct that the state  punishes.",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"criminal codes  in search of a picture  of what conduct leads  to a prison term,  or who  reads sentencing  rules in  order  to discover  how  severely different  sorts of crimes are punished,  will be seriously misled.",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The reason is that American criminal  law, federal and  state, is very broad;  it  covers  far more  conduct  than  any jurisdiction could  possibly punish. The  federal  code  alone  has  thousands of criminal  prohibitions covering  an  enormous  range  of  behavior,  from  the  heinous  to  the trivial.  State  codes  are  a  little  narrower,  but  not  much.  And  federal and  state  codes  alike  are  filled  with  overlapping  crimes,  such  that  a single criminal  incident typically violates  a half dozen or more  prohibitions. Lax  double jeopardy  doctrine  generally  permits the  government to charge  all  these  violations rather  than  selecting  among them.  Since all change  in  criminal  law  seems  to  push in  the  same  direction -toward more liability -this state  of affairs  is  growing worse: legislatures regularly  add  to  criminal  codes,  but  rarely  subtract  from  them.  In  a world  like  that, lists  of crimes  in statute  books  must bear  only  a slight relation to the  conduct  that leads  to a stay in the  local house  of corrections.",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Of course,  criminal  law's breadth  is  old  news.  It  has  long been  a source  of academic  complaint; 2 indeed,  it  has  long  been  the  starting point for  virtually  all the  scholarship  in  this  field,  which  (with the  important  exception  of sexual  assault)  consistently  argues  that  existing criminal  liability  rules  are  too  broad  and  ought  to  be  narrowed.  Yet the implications of this piece  of old news  are not well understood.",cover_heinonline,Stuntz - 2001 - The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law.pdf,pdf_first_page

"When  government  officials have  discretion, the  rule of  law also  requires that they  be accountable. This  ideal  carries even into the  world  of  criminal justice, where the  individual prosecutor's power dominates  the  scene.  We  hope  that every exercise of prosecutorial discretion takes place within a  framework  of prosecutorial accountability. 1",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"There  are  several methods  for holding prosecutors accountable in  this country. Judges  enforce a few legal boundaries on  the  work of  prosecutors, and  legislatures sometimes have their say about criminal  law enforcement. Prosecutors with positions lower  in  the  office or  department hierarchy must answer  to  those  at  the top.  As licensed attorneys, prosecutors must  answer  to  the  bar  authorities in  their states. But  none of  these controls binds  a  prosecutor too  tightly. At  the  end of the day, the  public  guards against abusive  prosecutors through  direct democratic control. In  the  United  States, we typically hold  prosecutors accountable for  their discretionary choices by asking the  lead prosecutor to  stand  for election from  time to  time.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This  is  not  true in  most places  around  the  globe. In  the  various civil law systems  in  other countries, the  idea  of  electing prosecutors is  jarring. In  the  civil law  depiction of  the  public prosecutor's job, training and  experience hold  criminal prosecutors accountable to  public values and  legal standards. Prosecutors in  a  civil law  tradition perform  a  ministerial function as  they  progress through  a  career-long bureaucratic journey. He  or she  simply  assembles  and evaluates the  available evidence;  if that  evidence  meets the  relevant standard  of  proof  to support  a conviction for  each  element  of  a crime, the  prosecutor has the  duty  to  initiate a prosecution. This lawyerly evaluation-nothing more  and  nothing lessconstitutes the  prosecutor's job. 2",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Consider  the  rhetoric of  the  civil law system.  The Italian Constitution limits prosecutors to the  ""initiation"" of  criminal proceedings, whenever supported  by adequate  evidence. 3 Obviously,  the  reality of  prosecutorial power in  civil law traditions is  complex,  and it  interacts with  a proactive vision of  the  judicial role. But  the  rhetoric that depicts the  prosecutor as  a  ministerial figure lowers  the  stakes and  treats prosecutorial discretion as  a  modest  problem.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Contrast this tradition of  ministerial restraint to  the  celebration of  open-ended power  that runs through the  rhetoric about  American  prosecutors. For  instance, the American  Bar  Association's Standards  for  Criminal  Justice  tell us that  the prosecutor ""may  in some circumstances and for  good cause consistent with  the public interest decline to  prosecute, notwithstanding that sufficient evidence  may exist which would support  a conviction."" 4 When  a single governmental  official holds  this much power,  the  methods  available for checking  the  work of that official deserve our  close attention.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Does the  democratic check  on  prosecutors work?  There  are  reasons to  believe that elections could  lead  prosecutors to  apply  the  criminal law according to  public priorities and values.  Voters  choose  their prosecutors at  the  local level, and  they care  enough  about  criminal law  enforcement to  monitor the  work of  an  incumbent. The conditions, in  some ways,  are  promising.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Yet the  reality of prosecutor elections is  not so encouraging. A  national sample  of  outcomes  in  prosecutor elections-described here  for  the  first  imereveals that incumbents do not  lose often.  The principal reason  is  that challengers do not  come forward  very  often, far less often than  challengers in  state legislative elections. Uncontested elections  hort-circuit the  opportunities for  voters to  learn about  the  incumbent's performance  in  office and to make  an  informed  judgment about  the  quality of  criminal enforcement in  their district.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Even in  those  exceptional campaign settings when the  incumbent  prosecutor faces  a challenge and is  forced  to  explain the  priorities and performance  of  the office, elections do  not perform  well.  The  themes  that incumbents  and  challengers invoke  in  their campaign speeches  represent a lost opportunity to  judge  whether the prosecutor has  applied the  criminal law  according to  public values.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"This article surveys  the  typical rhetoric in prosecutor election campaigns, drawing  on a new  database  that collects news accounts  of  candidate statements during  prosecutor elections. Those statements reflect the  candidates' claims  about how voters should  evaluate the  work  of  a chief prosecutor. Sadly, these campaign statements dwell  on outcomes in a few high visibility cases, such as botched murder trials and public  corruption investigations.

"In sum, prosecutor elections fail for  two reasons.  First, they  do not  often force  an incumbent  to  give  any public  explanation at all  for  the  priorities and practices of  the  office.  Second,  even when  incumbents  do face  challenges, the candidates talk more about  particular past cases  that about  the  larger patterns and values reflected in  local criminal justice.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In the  concluding  section of  this  article, I consider briefly a few possible responses to  these failures of  prosecutor elections. One strategy might  strengthen elections themselves, either by improving  the  quality of  information available to voters or  by aligning voter incentives at the  state and  local levels. Another  strategy would promote alternatives to  election campaigns,  by expanding  the  occasions when prosecutors would reveal and  explain their structural choices to  the  publicnot  waiting for new elections every  four years.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  combination, these  reforms  offer  some hope for  holding  prosecutors to account.  Better evaluations by  the  voters will not  succeed  alone, but  they can  work alongside other  external controls to  encourage  prosecutions in  line  with  public values.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Many  actors get  involved in  criminal law enforcement, and  the  public uses  a mix of  devices to  control those actors. Take the  police, for example. There  was a time  when  political patronage systems  built into local government  controlled the work  of police, with some  peripheral support  from tort  doctrines and state procedural rules. 5 Over  time, however,  legal doctrine and  legal institutions became more important in  the effort to  hold the  police accountable for their choices. In  the latter half of  the  twentieth century, the  federal constitution became a  more potent source  of  limits on the  police, and other  legal doctrines and legal  institutions reinforced the  trend. 6 Today,  limits on  the  work of  police officers derive from  the federal  constitution, state  constitutions, statutes, ordinances, judicial rules  of criminal  procedure, internal departmental regulations, and various  other  legal sources. 7 Electoral accountability still matters in  the  work of  the  police; sheriffs are  typically elected, and police chiefs are  among the  most  visible and important",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page

"A blend  of  legal  and electoral controls also  works on judges. State court judges  face  constitutional limits-founded on separation of  powers principlesalong  with statutory limits on their pre-trial and trial rulings. Procedural rules guide  many  of  their choices  before  conviction, and sentencing  guidelines or statutes channel  their traditional discretion in selecting the sanction. 9 Again, electoral controls  are also relevant  for  judges:  they are elected  in many jurisdictions, and elsewhere  they  are  appointed  by elected officials. 1 0 Still, the legal controls at  work on judges  are  vigorous, and the debates  about  electoral controls ask  whether  even  a  residual electoral check  on  judges  is worth  keeping.""",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page
"In  short, limits based  on positive law  have  moved to  the  center of  our  efforts to  control the  work of  police and  judges.  The positive law strategy has  been  less successful, however, with prosecutors. The  legal  controls  over criminal prosecutors are  relatively weak, and over  the  long  run,  we  do not  seem  to  be moving toward more vigorous  legal  limits.  By  default, more of  the  work of accountability for prosecutors must  come from  the  voters.",cover_heinonline,Wright - 2008 - How Prosecutor Elections Fail Us Symposium Prosecutorial Discretion.pdf,pdf_first_page

"Codes of  professional responsibility take  a  very  different approach to  civil and criminal trials. In  civil litigation, the  codes  presume that good outcomes result when  lawyers  represent clients aggressively. 1  In criminal cases, the  codes  do not  rely as  fully on competitive lawyering. They treat prosecutors as  advocates, but  also  as  ""ministers"" having  an ethical duty  to  ""do  justice."" 2",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Although  the special prosecutorial duty  is worded so  vaguely  that it obviously requires further explanation, the  codes  provide  remarkably little guidance  on its meaning. 3  In  effect, code  drafters have delegated to  prosecutors the  task of  resolving the  special ethical issues prosecutors face  at every  stage  of  trial. 4 Is  a  prosecutor free to  seek  a  jury biased  against the  defendant? If a  prosecutor becomes convinced  at  trial that defense  counsel is  overmatched  because  of  limited resources, what",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"1. Aggressive  representation, however,  is  subject to  the  codes'  limited constraints on excessive lawyer  conduct. See, e.g., MODEL RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Rules 3.1-3.3  (1983) [hereinafter MODEL RULES] (providing limits on specific types of  aggressive advocacy); MODEL CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY EC 7-1 (1981) [hereinafter CODE] (noting that ""[tihe duty  of a  lawyer ... is  to  represent his client zealously within the  bounds  of  the  law,  which  includes Disciplinary  Rules  and  enforceable professional regulations"") (footnotes omitted).",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"2.  See MODEL RULES, supra note  1,  Rule  3.8  comment (1) (stating that government  lawyers are  ""minister[s] of  justice""); CODE, supra note  1,  EC 7-13  (providing that government  lawyers  must ""seek  justice""); see  also ABA Joint Conference  on Professional Responsibility, Professional Responsibility: Report of the  Joint Conference, 44 A.B.A. J.  1159,  1218 (1958)  [hereinafter ABA  Joint Conference]  (noting prosecutor's ""dual  role""); Defoor, Prosecutorial Misconduct in  Closing Argument, 7 NOVA L.J. 443,  448 (1983)  (citing prosecutor's ""semi-judicial position"" under  Florida law); cf. Note, Role of  the  Prosecutor: Fair Minister of  Justice with  Firm  Convictions, 16 U. BRIT. COLUM. L. REv. 295, 297  (1982) (discussing Canadian prosecutor's minister of justice role). Throughout  this Article, I  refer to  ""the codes""  as  a  shorthand for  the  many state professional rules that model themselves  after the  two ABA codes. See  supra note  1. Virtually all  states have adopted  the  general approach  of  one  of  the  model codes  and  have  accepted the  ""do  justice"" standard  for government  lawyers.",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"3.  The duty  to  ""do  justice"" applies to  all government  attorneys, but  takes on its most  dramatic  significance in  criminal prosecutions. This  Article's discussion is  confined to  the  criminal context.",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"4.  Richard  Danzig  points out  that it  is not  unusual for  code drafters to  write general ethical proscriptions and  leave  it to  others to  define them. See Danzig, A Comment on the Jurisprudence of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code, 27 STAN. L.  REv. 621,  628-29  (1975).  Thus,  for example,  the Uniform Commercial Code proscribes ""unconscionable"" contracts, assuming  that someone (e.g., courts and tradesmen) will  give  meaning to  unconscionability. Danzig dubiously notes  that the premise  of such  rules is  ""that values have  an  objectively ascertainable existence and  a  near  universal  acceptance and  thus  can  be  judicially discovered."" Id. at  629.  As this Article discusses, the professional codes' requirement that prosecutors ""do  justice"" has  no  universally accepted meaning and does  not  lend  itself to  easy  interpretation.",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"are  the  prosecutor's options? Should  she 5  help  a  defendant whose lawyer  is  incompetent? What should  she  do  if she  believes the judge  incorrectly has  restricted counsel's ability to  present a defense?  In  her  own presentation, may she  legitimately invite the  jurors to  draw false inferences  from  the facts? How  emotional a  summation may she  make in  her effort to  sway the  jury toward  conviction?",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"The interpretive literature is  no more helpful than  the  codes  in resolving these and other ethical trial issues raised by the  ""do  justice"" admonition.  Scholars  have focused  exclusively on constitutional requirements and  on issues relating to  prosecutorial policy at  the  pretrial and sentencing stages.  Moreover,  judges  seem intent on limiting their own  role  in  defining appropriate trial conduct by prosecutors. Courts have declined to  strengthen legal  and constitutional controls, based  in part on the  belief that independent professional regulation best  constrains prosecutorial behavior. 7",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"5. To avoid  confusion, throughout this Article I  refer to  the prosecutor in  the female  gender. For  balance, I  treat the  other actors in  the  process (e.g., judges, defense counsel, witnesses, and defendants) as  male.",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"6. These  are, of  course, areas in  which  the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is more  evident than  in  the  trial context. Scholars have  attempted to  develop  guidelines and  models  for what  prosecutors should  do  in  charging, plea  bargaining, and (to a  limited extent) sentencing. See authorities cited infra note 19. When  addressing trial conduct, however,  authorities have looked  only  to the  constitutional issues raised by prosecutorial misconduct, such  as  whether  emotional summations violate due  process, and  whether  selection of  jurors on  the basis of  race  violates equal  protection. See  infra notes 219-21,  230,  235 and  accompanying  text. Most commentators  fail to recognize that prosecutors' ethical obligations may differ from  their constitutional responsibilities.",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
"Even when courts and  commentators  have addressed the  prosecutor's subconstitutional trial obligations, they have  shared the  codes' tendency to  speak  in  lofty, but  undefined, ""justice"" terms. Consider, for  example,  the  oft-quoted passage  from Berger  v.  United  States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935): ""[The prosecution's interest] is  not  that it shall win a  case, but  that justice shall be done ... [The  prosecutor] may prosecute with  earnestness and  vigor-indeed he  should do so.  But, while  he may  strike hard  blows,  he is  not  at  liberty to  strike foul  ones.""

DOUGLASS, ETHICAL ISSUES IN PROSECUTION 7-20 (1988) (quoting various famous but  generalized formulations of  the  ""prosecutor must  do  justice"" concept); Frampton, Some Practical and  Ethical Problems of Prosecuting Public Officials, 36 MD. L.  REv. 5, 7 (1976)  (discussing prosecutor's role as  administrator of  the criminal justice system); cf. Alschuler, Courtroom Misconduct by  Prosecutors and  Trial Judges, 50 Tx.  L.  REv. 629,  633 &amp; n.16  (1972)  (arguing that ""the  prosecutor should  be afforded less leeway  in  his  courtroom  conduct  than  the  defense  attorney"").",cover_heinonline,Zacharias - 1991 - Structuring the Ethics of Prosecutorial Trial Practice  Can Prosecutors Do Justice.pdf,pdf_first_page
