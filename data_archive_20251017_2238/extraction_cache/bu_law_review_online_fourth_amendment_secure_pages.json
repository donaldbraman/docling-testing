    "last_line": "23 in referring to the fourth amendment as a collective right, i do not mean to suggest that it would be reasonable to limit individuals' fourth amendment rights to protect the public's collective security. by way of comparison, see thomas k. clancy, the fourth amendment as a collective right , 43 t ex . t ech l. r ev . 255, 256 (2010). on the contrary, i argue for an expansive (if not wholly judicially unenforceable) reading of the right-one that restrains unreasonable police conduct that threatens the personal security of members of the political community collectively, not just the personal security of any particular individual. i am also not arguing here that the concept of the fourth amendment as a collective right would justify one person in seeking a remedy for the violation of another's rights. by way of comparison, see donald l. doernberg, 'the right of the people': reconciling collective and individual",
