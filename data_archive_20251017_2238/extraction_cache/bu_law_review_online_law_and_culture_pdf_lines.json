  "but this presumption, adopted automatically from the western societiesõ perspective, turns out to be less relevant in systems where political power is joined with the religious one, namely in theocratic countries.",
  "to best compare power of legal and cultural rules it could be useful to examine their (i) sources, (ii) purposes, (iii) values, (iv) content, (v) regulating methods, (vi) societal links, (vii) obedience, and (viii) enforcement.",
  "the original source of both legal and cultural rules is the need to organize the coexistence of individuals in a community within a model that is considered desirable by the community and its leaders.",
  "in the case of legal rules, after they consolidate through the formalized process of adoption, promulgation and use, finally they create a legal system.",
  "the consolidation of the customized culture and of the durable legal system is based on the formal (external) principles which are indispensable for their stability.",

  "the fundamental needs that law and culture rules must meet are to agree upon a form of coexistence that enables societies to achieve common goals.",
  "both regulatory systems share two main objectives: regulating relationships of individuals with other individuals and regulating relationships of individuals with their leaders and masters.",
  "however, even though law and culture share the same objectives, they may differ in the methods by which each addresses these objectives and their enforcement.",
  "the reasons for the differences may vary and may include different history, different natural environmentsñsuch as climate, or vicinity to waters or oceanñand different neighbors.",
  "the need for trust refers both to international and intranational relations, and the rules refer in different ways to the concept of doing the right thing.",

  "if culture, however, refers not only to the cluster of desired behavioral patterns but also to the entirety of intellectual and artistic heritage of",
  "in that sense, all norms, including those embedded in the rules, are not only prescriptions, but are patterns of behavior as well.",
  "even though an ethnic language is less formalized than a legal one, the minimal necessary condition of its usefulness is its acceptance by the group that uses it.",
  "legal rules are always noted with language built of words and signs, whereas with culture rules it is different because culture language can take different forms such as artistic expressions, visual arts, music, literature, and more.",
  "the way in which the rules regulate is built on multiple factors, the strongest of which are individual motivations of their addressees.",
  "even though it is discredited or denied by some deconstructionist streams of contemporary doctrine that refer to the fast changes, the certainty of the rules and the entire rule system is the ultimate guarantee of the systemõs efficiency.",
  "additionally, a clear hierarchy of sources as a key tool for the systematic interpretation that eliminates gaps and collisions makes the system of rules logical and structurally correct, and the continuity of the creation of the law system allows for understanding it.",
  "finally, anthropocentrism, which means that no other interests than the interests of humans and those other values that are important for humans (be it individual or collective), are in the center of the system created by the legal rules.",
  "compliance within reference to the legal rules is a state of accordance with the entirety of a normative environment despite the nature of these norms and independent of whether they are strictly binding or not.",
  "for example, in corporate law, regardless of how good the rules are, the problem is how to convince people to follow them.",
  "this leads to a couple of psychological questions: how peopleõs behavior can be shaped in order to assure compliance with the rules and which personal drivers work the most efficiently.",
  "if the purpose is shaping peopleõs behavior, we ought to understand the ways in which behavior is induced or enticed.",
  "nation, local and regional communities, other groups) is placed and to where the power authorized by this individual and these communities is directed.",
  "for legal rules, obedience refers to the formal authority; for culture rules, it is the informal authority of the society.",
  "it is worth noting that the informal authority of the society has often been powerful enough to assure obedience, even despite lack of acceptance of some rules by some individuals in some cases.",
  "but perception changes in this case if we think of a kind of a òdeferred enforcementó where believers follow the rules proposed by their religious leaders by accepting the concept of an ultimate justice that will enforce the judgement on their behavior in the future.",
  "the importance of law and culture also emerges when analyzing the problem of abuse of power resulting in a traumatic experience.",
  "for example, a child transferred at an early age to an orphanage may have very different trusting tendencies as compared to a child raised by supportive parents at home.",
  "a person, who, as a child, had one or a few bad experiences at school, may carry the trauma of the experience to adulthood.",
  "bad experiences of trusting at a very early age are likely to produce a trauma which is carried for life or at least until the person undergoes psychiatric treatment, which helps resurface these childhood experiences to be remembered, understood, and often analyzed.",
  "memory and realization of the source offer the key for relief and a more controlled and rational reaction to present events and experiences.",
  "thus, a childhood event that resulted in a painful exposure to a breach of trust may be carried to an approach of mistrust and sometimes to a behavior of breach of trust.",
  "the vague memory of the painful breach of trust may provide the model of the same behavior as a protection against being the subject of this painful treatment.",
  "similarly, an unfair treatment at a very early age is likely to be forgotten, but the painful and angry reaction may be carried to become part of a personõs behavior.",
  "they may find soul brothers and sisters, as well as organizations, that share either the actual reaction, backed by their background, or follow friends and leaders that have a similar reaction.",
  "the united states, as well as part of europe, has had a history of the mafia, which demonstrates this type of group culture.",
  "their model spawns a reflection by their followers and gives rise of a culture of mistrust and a large number of sociopaths who habitually practice a breach other peopleõs trust in them.",
  "it is a product of a slow process and sometimes years of leadership and practices that then take root in a culture and are hard to change.",
  "even if the breach of trust and the gain spawn benefits, it seems that the feelings of winning and achievement do not last.",
  "one reason may be the realization that the violation is not only prohibited but also punished by some of societyõs rules of law or culture.",
  "regardless of whether the violator disagrees with societyõs rules, the punishment that is looming large in the background usually does not leave.",
  "this shadow can accompany the violator of trust even when it is supported by a myriad of arguments, justifications, and even pride.",
  "any helper in the violation of other peopleõs trust may be a good target for blame, especially if that helper has performed the directions of the abuser.",
  "it is something to plan, to prepare, to find whom to blame later, if necessary, and it involves the self-satisfaction of being smart and exposing the stupidity of others, especially those whom the person feels are competitors.",
  "its short-term satisfaction, as well as its longer concerns, are not lasting enough to erase the childhood anger and anguish and fill the void of a pattern of similar behavior.",
  "the following are the usually most effective and powerful ones, although their order of presentation does not necessarily demonstrate their history or relative effectiveness.",
  "but a general observation may suggest that the enforcement of a rule of culture is based on fear, such as the police enforcement or punishment of prison or fines.",
  "however, in many situations the more hidden the identity of the enforcer, the more effective the rulesõ enforcement might be.",
  "most humans, if not all, seek freedom to think and act as they wish and to receive all the protection and needs that they require and cannot provide for themselves.",
  "however, unlike many animals and living units in which support for members of their species is genetic, the humansõ support of other humans is not genetic.",
  "even the parentsõ love of their children does not reach the genetic level and depends on the nature of the relationship, the individuals, and the way they were raised.",
  "therefore, if the possible supporter must be relied upon and if this supporter is not forced to provide the necessary support, the supporter may gain power over the dependent personõs behavior by threatening to withdraw, or actually withdrawing, support, or conditioning support on required behavior by the dependent.",
  "in sum, human support of other humans is not free; it can be accompanied by the supporterõs power to control and influence the dependentsõ behavior.",
  "a culture, which is enforced by entrenched habits, is shielded more effectively against horrific surprises for which people are unprepared.",
  "just as crucial, however, is the requirement of any culture to include a habit of flexibility in order to reflect and adjust to environmental changes and to be linked to necessary fundamental values.",
  "a habitual obedience creates not only an easy way to behave, as does any habit, but also may produce an uneasy feeling when disobedience is an option.",
  "however, even the danger of such results may be overcome when obedience to orders produces related and similar pain, or if it has created a counter-habit of disobedience.",
  "furthermore, habits of both obedience and disobedience may depend on the habit of reliance on others to support either of these behaviors.",
  "in sum, habits may be induced by other humans, or by a changed environment, and not necessarily by third parties.",
  "in addition, the use or possible use of force may establish in humans (and perhaps in animals as well) a habit of fear.",
  "however, the threat of force works well only if the subject of the fear is weaker emotionally or physically than the carrier of the force and if the subject of the coercive force has little or no hope of getting help soon after a threat of coercive force was",
  "the winner may ultimately be the weaker fearing party, especially if that party continues to seek various forms of protection.",
  "forms of protection may involve: seeking and discovering the stronger partyõs weak points and vulnerable desires, and then using those weakness points to achieve protection; seeking others to provide protection and reducing the strength of the opponent; or ascertaining the strong partyõs desires and trying to use it as a counter powerful protection by offering and withdrawing the satisfaction of these desires.",
  ", the stronger person needs the weaker personõs contributions or cooperation as well), the weaker person may depend for protection on this strong personõs need for protection.",
  "to be sure, if the dependent party has such an advantage, it might have a protective bargaining chip to manage the relationship with the powerful party.",
  "so long as a dependent person has a counter-control over a source of power, such as the army or finance or anything that the controlling person needs, the dependent party has a measure of protection against coercion.",
  "however, when the coercive member controls these means, such as large sources of a countryõs wealth, this control supports the coercive power of the strong person and induces further obedience.",
  "in contrast, if the weak person or persons control these sources, this control may become the strong personõs òachilles heel.ó if the weak person is able to recruit othersõ help both within the area of the powerful party, as well as outside it, the cooperating parties may overcome the strong person or group of people that rules.",
  "comparing the effects of long-term changes in the enforcement as compared to short-term changes in the environment on the enforcement of rules invites the question: òhow is the enforcement of a rule affected by long-term possible events as compared to short-term surprises?ó in both cases, we deal with the same puzzling elementñthe range of the ruleõs enforcement, when the rule itself is not explicit about enforcement.",
  "in addition, most importantly, the ruleõs interpretation and its range of application have been tested and examined in various contexts, subjects, and enforcement forms.",
  "furthermore, the long-term rule has been adjusted by interpretation not only to the reality of the date of its passage but also to changes that may have occurred since its passage.",
  "in the case of a short-term notice command, if the substance of the command is known and is embodied in the general rule, then the command is part of that ruleõs general interpretation.",
  "however, if the command does not contain a closely comparable application to the general ruleõs application or other similar situations, the legitimacy of the command is not established.",
  "the particular situation presented was not tested or applied in the past and cannot draw on a precedent to determine its justification and range of applicability.",
  "in the first case, there are long-term applications of a rule, its interpretation and precedents, and a system of interpretation that would apply to new situations.",
  "in the second, short-term surprise command, this application of the rule has not been tested and no precedent has been established as to its range and rationale.",
  "however, the òsurpriseó of the surprise command should not be a surprise to the subject of the command but to the range of interpretation and applicability of the rule.",
  "it is not whether the subject of the command knew of its legitimacy but whether a command under such circumstances is valid.",
  "but if the law requires that person to be aware of the command and understand it, then these conditions, like all conditions concerning the force of the command as law, must be observed in order to enforce the command.",
  "in addition, a long-term rule and its application to new situations are likely to produce a system of interpreting the ruleõs applicability to new òsurpriseó situations.",
  "it requires the innovator of the new interpretation to justify it, usually by demonstrating that the innovationõs roots, purposes, and underlying values are tightly linked to the foundational rationale of the rule.",
  "yet, the interpretation must be performed by an independent party rather than the commander or the subject to the command.",
  "the more difficult, yet perhaps also most effective, form of conditioning humans is cooperation with those who agree only partially with oneõs view and values.",
  "it requires weighing the value of oneõs own values with a concern not only between what is best for the actor versus the best for society now and long-term, but also oneõs own interests, benefits, and losses.",
  "anger may convert into satisfaction, and winning may convert into a satisfying compromise by many more people than one could imagine thus creating a surprisingly large following.",
  "in contract, if an event is likely to tighten and increase the power of a party, then even though the event is only a possibility, it might cast its shadow on the controlling party.",
  "parents must go to work and the children must go to school, they might not eat breakfast together and thus their unique breakfast times becomes the family rule.",
  "in the evening, and during holidays, and during birthdays, however, the habitual rule is that family members eat together, and the participants may include the birthday personõs friends.",
  "if any participant wishes to break the rule, for example, by missing a meeting, the participant is expected ask for permission from a person who is authorized to grant the permission.",
  "at home, parents might ask permission from each other; children might have to ask the mother or father or both.",
  "the exceptions to the rules usually arise with short-term and spotty surprises, such as a job requirement for the parents, a unique event for the children, or illness or for any member of the family.",
  "there are other contexts in which rules can acquire the force of a habit subject to exceptions for justifiable reasons.",
  "many of the underlying values driving these rules are similar, although elements of enforcement may be combined in different ways.",
  "methods for enforcement may include force and coercion; rewards for compliance and punishment for non-compliance; conditioning the population from a very early age to comply with the directives of parents, teachers, and government officials; demonstrating, following, and enforcement from a very early age by watching appropriate movies and theater; competition of various abilities from spelling to sports and support of the needy.",
  "making fun of a concept or a form of behavior, on the one hand, and considering such a behavior as holy and unique, on the other hand, may leave a lifelong reaction on a child and a community.",
  "good and bad, holy and sacrilegious, a trusted personõs and a traitorõs behavior, may never leave an adult after childhood inculcation.",
  "13 see tamar frankel, fiduciary law 101 (2011) (noting role of a societyõs culture, institutions, and values in determining balance between ethicsor morality-imposed selfpolicing, legal policing, and partiesõ self-policing).",
  "if a value is to avoid using force to induce others to follow a rule, but rather try to convince or induce others to follow it, a society may enforce such a rule in a variety of ways, including: enticing attention by leadership to following the rules, which is a reward in and by itself; by granting awards, giving a public or private òthankyou,ó creating appropriate publicity, notices, or granting medals or titles; or paying money or other tradable assets.",
  "they may include withdrawal of permission to practice certain professions, such as law and medicine, or require engaging in certain trades or producing certain items or driving cars and so on.",
  "a licensor is not only the regulator of the particular activity but also could be an enforcer of that activity and or a related activity.",
  "the famous joke is of the young members of the boy scouts who were told to help older people cross the street and then forced an old woman to cross the street against her will.",
  "some family rules require all members to act or avoid acting in a certain way, and the rules may cover a significant part of the membersõ lives.",
  "in this case, the military may be more rigid than the family, even though the feelings of the family member may be far stronger than his or her feeling for the military.",
  "another important question is, does examining behavior help us examine our own behavior and drive us to finding more effective cultural rules?",
  "this awareness may lead to following what we learned or avoiding it at all costs, depending on our own values.",
  "to what degree are the current cultural rules acceptable to the particular subjects of the rules and the relevant population at large?",
  "this question can be answered by looking at the degree of the popular acceptance and following of the rule, and the time span in which the rule was imposed by the population.",
  "in both cases we could count dozens of changes, including the evolution of alternatives, the rise of fraud, anger, and defiance in populations, while there are also support, friendship, and commitment to others by others.",
  "when an environment changes drastically, and with it the rules that follow, that is when our culture, laws, behavior, and reaction both to change and to each other are tested.",
  "this is the moment for understanding ourselves, as well as our governance system, values, and the rules we live by.",
  "and perhaps this is a blessing that we should not try to escape but choose to self-examine, judge, and change.",
  "a habit is valuable because it does not require a continuous single full-scale examination to determine how we should direct behavior.",
  "however, when it comes to habits of behavior, over which the person, rather than the body, controls the commander, the formation and power of habits are more complex.",
  "in psychology, a òhabitó is defined as òa more fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental habit.ó 15 a person may not have intended to acquire the habit and may not even be aware of the habit.",
  "according to a 2002 study, between one third to one half of participantsõ behaviors were classified as habits, i.e., performed almost daily and usually in the same location.",
  "18 the american journal of psychology defines a òhabit, from the standpoint of psychology [as] a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience.ó habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks.",
  "a 2002 daily experience study by òhabit researcheró wendy wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit.",
  "old habits are hard to change or break, and new habits are hard to form because the repeated behavioral patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in the neural pathways.",
  "a 2007 study by wood and neal found that when behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.",
  "a culture, which is enforced by entrenched habits, is shielded more effectively against horrific surprises for which people are unprepared.",
  "however, just as crucial is the requirement of any culture to include a habit of flexibility to reflect and adjust to environmental changes and be linked to necessary fundamental values.",
  "therefore, when the value of competition governs as a matter of habit, it may become toxic when a significant change in the environment occurs and there is no counter-habit or sufficient flexibility to support powerful peopleõs identification with needy others.",
  "a habit of satisfying flexibility for the benefit of a group, rather than oneself, can provide protection and support against unexpected changes that may undermine wealth, health, and a current power structure, as the covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated.",

  "(ii) what values must we inculcate in ourselves, our children, and in others by education and information to achieve this objective?",
