[2] when it eliminated many of these restrictions on july 1, 2021, the ncaa ushered in a new era for college athletics. [3] this transcendent, seismic pivot [4] permitted student-athletes to accept remuneration for endorsements and autographs, for example. [5] student-athletes’ newfound freedoms paid off-literally-in the first year of the name, image, and likeness (“nil”) era. [6] student-athletes received just under a billion dollars for nil activities in that time frame, an amount which some expect to increase in the future. [7] on the individual level, nineteen-year old university of texas football student-athlete quinn ewers’ nil earnings total nearly $4 million, for example. [8] women student-athletes have also benefited, as evidenced by university of connecticut (“uconn”) women’s basketball student-athlete paige bueckers. bueckers will miss the 2022-23 women’s basketball season due to a knee injury but will return to play for uconn in 2023-24 in lieu of beginning her professional basketball career, as remaining a uconn student-athlete will provide more lucrative nil opportunities than available in the women’s national basketball association (“wnba”). [9] in fact, bueckers’ array of nil arrangements will generate more compensation for her than the base salary she would earn as the number one overall wnba draft selection. [10] student-athletes have also utilized their nil to benefit charitable and community efforts. among the many examples is university of iowa football student-athlete tory taylor. as an international student, the australian-born taylor faces complications and restrictions regarding his ability to earn revenue from his nil. [11] after verifying that using his nil to raise money for charities would not negatively impact his standing as an international student, taylor teamed with local nonprofit count the kicks to raise money for its fetal movement awareness campaign. [12] an elite punter, taylor was a natural fit for an organization that sought to encourage pregnant people to monitor daily kick counting sessions during their pregnancy’s third trimester. [13] t-shirts with the slogan “punting is winning” with taylor’s name and jersey number on the back “easily has become the most popular among iowa (football) fans,” with taylor donating over $11,000 to count the kicks from their sale. [14] university of arkansas football student-athlete kj jefferson likewise used his nil for a good cause, teaming with organizations like the united way on a social media campaign to raise money for flood victims in jefferson’s home state of mississippi. [15] while the nil era has resulted in many positives, it has also led to uncertainty, chaos, and a free-for-all. [16] instead of adopting new bylaws that apply to all member universities, the ncaa instead implemented a minimalist “uniform interim policy” that eliminated ncaa bylaws restricting student-athletes’ monetization of their nil [17] that had been longstanding. [18] while the ncaa’s interim policy is barebones, [19] it includes some restrictions. [20] the interim policy, for example, “preserves the commitment to avoid pay-for-play and improper inducements tied to choosing a particular school.” [21] rules are only effective if enforced, however, [22] and many college athletics constituents crave enforcement of ncaa nil restrictions. [23] more than eighteen months into the nil era, however, its legal and regulatory landscape is unclear. [24] though the ncaa “built its reason for existence on enforcement,” it has not enforced any of its interim policy’s restrictions, [25] let alone alleged potential nil violations, [26] culminating in a wild, wild west college athletics climate. [27] the ncaa has, however, put member universities on notice that it is investigating potential nil rules infractions [28] with a focus on university staff members and representatives’ behaviors. [29] in fact, ncaa vice president of enforcement jon duncan recently explained that there a lot of cases involving nil or nil adjacent behavior “in the hopper” that will soon see sunshine. [30] further, the ncaa adopted a guilty-until-proven-innocent standard for potential violations of its interim nil policy. [31] the ncaa’s recent staff additions likewise suggest it will aggressively enforce its nil restrictions. in august, the ncaa hired a former cia deputy group chief and fbi executive leader with decades of cybersecurity, counterintelligence, and strategic communications experience. [32] the ncaa also recently advertised a job opening titled “associate director of enforcement for name, image, and likeness,” with the position’s primary responsibility including identifying potential ncaa violations. [33] this individual’s tasks will include monitoring and enforcing ncaa rules and guidelines regarding nil. [34] with nil rules enforcement appearing an ncaa priority [35] and potentially facing the guilty-until-proven-innocent standard for violations, universities should follow ncaa nil regulations and, like all other ncaa rules, [36] monitor their compliance with them. this article’s aims include identifying both: (1) the ncaa nil restrictions with which universities must monitor their compliance and (2) suggested activities universities can undertake to effectively monitor compliance with ncaa nil restrictions. thus, part i details the current ncaa enforcement process by which the ncaa enforces its myriad rules and describes universities’ efforts to comply with ncaa legislation on campuses. part ii describes ncaa nil restrictions and suggests actions for universities that would satisfy their monitoring obligations and help foster compliance with ncaa nil guidelines. a brief conclusion follows. i. the current ncaa division i [37] enforcement and infractions processes the ncaa is “big, national, the focus of media and public attention, and scrutinized by legislators.” [38] a private association, [39] the ncaa describes itself as “a member-led organization” that consists of over 1,000 colleges and universities. [40] a ground-up entity, [41] the ncaa derives its authority from its member universities. [42] through the ncaa’s legislative process, the universities that belong to it propose and adopt rules regarding college athletics and implement them on campus. [43] ncaa legislation, while often complex, [44] attempts to level the playing field for universities competing against each other. [45] member universities and their staff and student-athletes agree to abide by the rules in exchange for the opportunity to compete in ncaa-sponsored competitions. [46] the ncaa notoriously does not lack for rules. [47] for example, one ncaa division i bylaw defines the term “business day[,]” while others regulate when and how often coaches may call or write prospective student-athletes, or even answer incoming calls from them. [48] thus, college coaches work in an environment controlled by ncaa rules, [49] and the ncaa expects staff members and student-athletes to know and follow its rules. [50] rules are meaningless unless enforced, however. [51] the ncaa investigative and penal process through which it sanctions member universities and their staff members for ncaa rules violations is unique, [52] and, like the ncaa itself, the public holds many misperceptions about it. [53] thus, this part details the ncaa enforcement and infractions process, hopefully clearing up any misperceptions. a. ncaa enforcement staff and its roles in the infractions process universities and staff members that abide by ncaa legislation should not be disadvantaged by doing so. [54] thus, ncaa member universities created an infractions process to help ensure fair play and integrity among members. [55] one group of ncaa employees in particular bears this responsibility: the enforcement staff. [56] the enforcement staff is akin to the ncaa’s prosecutor. [57] it is the ncaa entity responsible for reviewing information about potential violations. [58] the enforcement staff receives information regarding potential rule violations from many sources, including self-reports and sources. [59] its investigators must review information regarding potential violations in a “fair, accurate, collaborative, and timely manner.” [60] if the enforcement staff believes information may substantiate violations, it alleges potential level i or level ii violations, with the former being the more significant of the two. [61] the enforcement staff states its allegations in a notice of allegations, a formal document directed to the university and involved individuals. [62] the enforcement staff bears the burden of proving these violations. [63] b. resolution of ncaa infractions cases if the enforcement staff is the prosecutor of ncaa rules violations, the committee on infractions (“coi”) is the judge and jury. [64] there are currently three means by which an infractions case involving a division i member university resolves, and all conclude with a committee on infractions (“coi”) decision. [65] founded in 1954, [66] the coi is an independent administrative body that includes volunteers from ncaa member universities, athletics conferences, former coaches, and individuals from the general public who possess legal training. [67] more specifically, coi panelists’ professional profiles include current and former university presidents, chancellors, athletics directors, conference commissioners, former coaches, attorneys, and professors. [68] thus, the coi touts the infractions process as “peer-review[ed].” [69] there are up to twenty-four coi members at any given time, a smaller panel of which considers each case on the coi’s behalf. [70] one way that an infractions case resolves is through “negotiated resolution.” this path is available in instances where the university and any other parties (e.g., coaches) agree with the enforcement staff on the facts, violations, level(s) of violations, and penalties. [71] if that occurs, and the parties seek to pursue negotiated resolution, they draft a report and submit it to the coi for review. [72] the coi reviews the appropriateness of the parties’ agreed-upon penalties. [73] if the parties to an infractions case agree to the facts and violation level but disagree on penalties, they may attempt to resolve their case via the “summary disposition” track. [74] when doing so, the enforcement staff, university, and any individual subject to a violation charge submit a report to the coi. [75] if the coi accepts the report, it administers penalties. [76] however, the coi may reject the report and order a full hearing if it feels the enforcement staff failed to allege a pertinent violation. [77] the third way an infractions case resolves is via a hearing on a contested case. when the university and/or individuals dispute the enforcement staff’s allegations, a panel of coi members conducts a hearing and determines whether the enforcement staff’s allegations are accurate and, if so, imposes penalties on the university and any staff member(s). [78] the coi also has the authority to conclude that violations occurred even when the enforcement staff did not allege them. [79] a coi hearing, which is not open to the public, [80] combines elements of a legal trial, an administrative agency hearing, and an academic misconduct hearing on a university campus. [81] following a hearing, the coi confers privately, [82] ultimately producing a written decision detailing the facts, violations, penalties, [83] and reasoning for its findings and penalties. [84] this written report is publicly available [85] and is comparable to a court opinion. [86] in summary disposition and contested cases, the coi follows ncaa member-legislated guidelines when issuing penalties. [87] penalties should reflect the violations’ severity and degree of institutional fault while heeding the interests of other universities not involved in the case by offsetting any competitive or other advantage through sanctions. [88] “the penalties range from financial penalties and vacation of records to [athletics] scholarship reductions and postseason bans.” [89] a law review article co-authored by former coi vice chair gene marsh describes the coi as “the thousand pound gorilla, with the final word in the case.” [90] some consider the coi to be the most powerful committee in college athletics. [91] c. ncaa rules compliance on university campuses the ncaa division i constitution requires member universities to comply with all ncaa rules, [92] and holds universities accountable for their staff members’ actions. [93] thus, “[b]ecause universities act through individuals for whom they are responsible, when one such individual commits a violation so too does the university.” [94] the university’s knowledge and exercise of due diligence is irrelevant-its responsibility stems from its relationship with the individual who broke rules. [95] ncaa member universities’ top responsibility toward each other and the ncaa is institutional control. [96] institutional control requires universities to self-police and self-report any violations of ncaa rules. [97] thus, just as following ncaa rules is an obligation of ncaa membership, “member institutions must monitor the conduct of those for whom they are responsible and sanction them for violations.” [98] ncaa legislation explicitly holds a university’s president or chancellor accountable for its athletics department’s conduct. [99] practically, however, a university’s athletics director has a greater impact on the attitudes of staff members, coaches, student-athletes, and boosters toward ncaa rules compliance. [100] athletics directors are full-time administrators who oversee their respective university’s athletics enterprises. [101] their jobs are 24/7, and their vast responsibilities may include negotiating multimillion-dollar media and licensing rights agreements, managing highly paid coaches, acting as fundraising and development specialists, balancing budgets, and mastering applicable compliance standards. [102] while the athletics director “sets the tone, ncaa rules compliance hardly defines the job.” [103] as most of the athletics compliance responsibility on a campus therefore falls on the athletics department’s compliance staff, [104] it is essential that an athletics department possesses a strong compliance department. [105] compliance offices often include several staff members who focus on student-athletes’ financial aid and academic eligibility among all of the other applicable ncaa rules. [106] a university’s athletics compliance department’s overall mission and everyday duty is to keep the athletics department and student-athletes compliant with ncaa rules. [107] responsible for serving coaches, current and prospective student-athletes, athletics representatives, and supporters of as many as dozens of sports and hundreds of student-athletes, [108] this section describes the important monitoring and rules enforcement roles that athletics compliance administrators play on their campuses to help maintain institutional control. monitoring systems help ensure rules compliance. [109] a compliance staff’s monitoring efforts include double checking and verifying information. [110] thus, compliance administrators often require sport staff members and student-athletes to complete and submit numerous forms. [111] for example, coaches must disclose information regarding practice hours so the compliance staff can verify compliance with relevant ncaa limitations. [112] compliance administrators often verify the veracity of the coaches’ submitted practice hours by providing that information to student-athletes to review and/or by spot-checking practices. [113] when coaches realize the information they submit is subject to review by their student-athletes or that compliance administrators may show up at practices, they are more likely to provide complete and accurate information. [114] while coaches may not appreciate this watchful eye on their sport programs, [115] they must understand that “when (the coi) concludes that institutional monitoring and oversight were not reasonably calculated to prevent and uncover violations, then it will penalize the institution for a failure to monitor its athletic programs.” [116] a failure to monitor allegation is among the most serious at the enforcement staff’s disposal. [117] along with effective monitoring, “[e]nforcement is a necessary component to a successful athletics compliance program.” [118] when there appears to be a potential ncaa violation on campus, the compliance staff is often responsible for investigating and, if that investigation concludes that a violation occurred, reporting it to the enforcement staff. [119] compliance administrators usually must impose a penalty for a violation, sometimes in consultation with the athletics director. [120] ii. monitoring nil compliance though the interim nil policy that the ncaa adopted on july 1, 2021that permits student-athletes to monetize their nil is “minimalist,” [121] it contains some restrictions. [122] the ncaa’s subsequent guidance and clarifications regarding the interim policy placed additional restrictions on universities’ involvement in nil. [123] already overwhelmed and under resourced, [124] compliance administrators must monitor and enforce these restrictions on their campuses. [125] this part identifies the nil restrictions that universities, specifically athletics compliance administrators, should monitor and suggests activities for doing so. a. ncaa interim policy and guidelines the ncaa’s interim nil policy began on july 1, 2021, [126] and it has since provided clarification or guidance of it in may [127] and october of 2022. [128] the may 2022 guidance was largely a warning shot to “collectives,” [129] which prominent alumni and influential supporters of a single university establish as a means to pool funds to help provide nil opportunities for student-athletes. [130] these boosters have formed over 200 collectives nationally, [131] many of which distribute between $3 and $5 million to student-athletes, mostly those who play football or basketball, at a single university. [132] controversy accompanied the formation of collectives, with reports suggesting that prospective and current student-athletes received multimillion dollar nil arrangements for enrolling, or staying, at a particular university, respectively. [133] worried that collectives were using nil agreements to induce athletes to attend, or remain enrolled at, a particular university, the may 2022 guidance sought to address-and prevent-collectives’ involvement in recruiting. [134] the ncaa pointed out that collectives typically meet its legislated definition of a booster and thus ncaa rules preclude them from engaging in recruiting activities, including recruiting conversations and provision of benefits, on a university’s behalf. [135] the may 2022 guidance did not slow collectives’ involvement in the recruiting process, however. [136] the ncaa’s october 2022 guidance therefore attempted to address “specifically how the current rules relate to division i member schools’ involvement in nil activities.” [137] while the guidance promulgates both permissible and impermissible forms of university interaction with booster collectives, [138] it actually removed universities from the nil process to a large degree, [139] largely empowering collectives and other third-party nil platforms. [140] b. ncaa restrictions regarding nil and suggested monitoring activities for them the ncaa’s interim nil policy and its may and october 2022 guidance and clarifications placed restrictions regarding nil activities for universities, university staff members, student-athletes, and prospective student-athletes. the below table identifies these restrictions and suggests activities for each that universities should undertake to monitor compliance with them on their campuses. most of the monitoring can be accomplished by the following primary suggested activities: creating and reviewing forms that athletics staff members and incoming and current student-athletes would complete and submit annually to compliance administrators. these forms, referred to in this article as athletics staff nil form, incoming sa nil form, and returning sa nil form, respectively, would inquire regarding the subject matter of several ncaa restrictions on nil. compliance administrators would review and analyze submitted forms and follow up on any red flags. to monitor to ensure that student-athletes’ nil arrangements included quid pro quo, for example, the returning sa nil form would inquire regarding the services that the student-athlete provided in exchange for remuneration. if a student-athlete indicated on the form that they did not provide any services in exchange for receiving nil compensation, compliance administrators would follow up with the student-athlete to determine whether the nil arrangement violated the ncaa requirement that student-athletes do something in exchange for nil payment. [141] reviewing nil agreements and related documentation that student-athletes submit to the university. analyzing such information would enable compliance administrators to monitor whether student-athletes receive nil compensation based on athletics performance, for example. annual individual meetings with high-profile incoming and returning student-athletes to inquire about their nil arrangements. sit-downs between compliance administrators and high-profile student-athletes would provide a prime opportunity to monitor compliance with, and educate regarding, numerous ncaa nil restrictions. at a time when the ncaa deregulates other areas of ncaa legislation, [142] compliance administrators may have additional time and resources to engage in these activities, which should not be overly burdensome or out of the ordinary for them. requiring completion of and reviewing forms, for example, is a familiar way for compliance administrators to monitor. [143] likewise, many universities already require student-athletes to submit documentation related to nil arrangements. [144] the coi has stated that universities owe a higher degree of monitoring regarding high-profile student-athletes, [145] and compliance administrators at many universities already devote additional resources to educating and monitoring them. [146] undertaking these suggested monitoring activities would help ensure compliance with the ncaa’s interim nil policy and subsequent guidelines and mitigate the likelihood of a potential failure to monitor allegation in the instance that individuals violate ncaa restrictions in a covert manner. [147] table 1. suggested monitoring activities. restriction source suggested monitoring activities nil agreements may not constitute improper inducements to attend, or remain at, a particular university. [148] ncaa interim nil policy [149] the incoming sa nil form and returning sa nil form should inquire whether nil arrangements, or offers of them, influenced their decision to attend, or remain at, their university, respectively. in meetings with high profile incoming and returning student-athletes, compliance administrators should inquire regarding nil’s role in their university selection or decision to remain enrolled at the university. nil agreements may not constitute “pay-for-play” (e.g., payment conditioned on number of touchdowns scored). ncaa interim nil policy [150] the returning sa nil form should require student-athletes to verify that they have not entered an nil arrangement under which performance factors in to pay. review student-athletes’ nil materials to ensure performance does not affect remuneration. nil agreements must contain quid pro quo (e.g., student-athletes must perform some type of service to receive compensation) ncaa interim nil policy [151] the incoming sa nil form and returning sa nil form should inquire regarding student-athletes’ services provided in nil arrangements. review student-athletes’ nil materials to ensure they include quid pro quo. during meetings with high profile incoming and current student-athletes, compliance administrators should inquire regarding services provided for nil payment. universities may not provide compensation to student-athletes in exchange for their nil. ncaa interim nil policy [152] the returning sa nil form should require student-athletes to identify the source of compensation for all nil arrangements. review student-athletes’ nil materials to ensure they do not include compensation from the university. the athletics staff nil form should require staff members to verify they have not compensated student-athletes for their nil and understand that ncaa rules prohibit them from doing so. collectives may not communicate with a prospective student-athlete, or those affiliated with them, for a recruiting purpose. may 2022 guidance [153] the incoming sa nil form should inquire whether collectives engaged with incoming student-athletes regarding the recruiting process or attending the university. during meetings with high profile incoming student-athletes, compliance administrators should inquire regarding pre-enrollment interactions with collectives. university coaches and staff may not facilitate a meeting between a booster collective and a prospective student-athlete (e.g., provide the entity with a recruiting or watch list). may 2022 guidance [154] the incoming sa nil form should inquire regarding meetings with collectives and the sources of their arrangements. the athletics staff nil form should require staff members to verify they have not facilitated any such meetings. compliance administrators should consider enacting a procedure for monitoring coaches’ phone records to look for patterns suggesting they are facilitating meetings between collectives and prospects. [155] university coaches and staff may not communicate with a prospective student-athlete on behalf of a collective. may 2022 guidance [156] the incoming sa nil form should inquire regarding communication with coaches regarding collectives. during meetings with high profile incoming student-athletes, compliance administrators should inquire regarding communication with coaches regarding collectives. the athletics staff nil form should require athletics staff to verify they have not communicated with prospects on behalf of a collective. universities may not engage in negotiations on behalf of an nil entity or a student-athlete to secure specific nil opportunities. october 2022 guidance [157] the returning sa nil form should inquire regarding involvement of university staff members in nil opportunities. the athletics staff nil form should require staff to verify that they have not engaged in nil-related negotiations on behalf of an nil entity or student-athlete. universities may not provide free services (e.g., graphic designers, tax preparation, contract review) or equipment (e.g., cameras, graphics software, computers) to student-athletes for nil activities unless they do so for non-athlete students. october 2022 guidance [158] the returning sa nil form should inquire regarding the use of university services for nil activities. [159] during meetings with high profile student-athletes, compliance administrators should inquire regarding the use of free university services for nil activities. the athletics staff nil form should require staff to verify that they have not provided any such free services. universities may not permit student-athletes to promote nil activities while participating in required athletics activities. october 2022 guidance [160] while attending games and practices, compliance administrators should monitor to ensure student-athletes do not promote nil activities. [161] compliance administrators should require sport staff members and student-athletes to verify that no nil promotions occurred during required athletics activities when they submit and review practice logs, respectively. university personnel may not donate cash directly to, be employed by, or have an ownership stake in nil entities. october 2022 guidance [162] the athletics staff nil form should require staff members to verify that they have not engaged in any such activities with nil entities. compliance administrators should request materials from nil entities listing their donors, employees, and owners to ensure no university personnel donated funds to, worked for, or had an ownership interest in, the entities. universities may not request that funds that donors provide to collectives and nil entities be directed to a specific sport or student-athlete. october 2022 guidance [163] the athletics staff nil form should require staff members to verify that they have not requested that funds they provided to collectives and nil entities were earmarked for a particular sport or student-athlete. compliance administrators should collect and monitor written communication (e.g., campaign mailouts, promotional materials) sent to the athletics department’s donors and potential donors to verify that they do not include requests that donations to collectives and nil entities are earmarked for a particular sport or student-athlete. universities may not provide tickets or suites as an incentive to provide funds to an nil entity. october 2022 guidance [164] the athletics staff nil form should require staff members to verify that they did not provide tickets or suites to incentivize providing funds to an nil entity. compliance administrators should update any sport staff discretionary ticket monitoring practices and forms to require sport staff members to verify that they do not provide tickets or suites to incentivize providing funds to an nil entity. [165] conclusion though imperfect, college athletics’ nil era is upon us and here to stay. while minimalist, the ncaa’s nil policy and subsequent guidance and clarifications contain restrictions for which universities must monitor their compliance. with the implementation of three new forms, reviewing student-athletes’ nil documentation, meeting with high profile student-athletes, and some additional activities, the compliance administrators who will largely bear the monitoring burden can effectively accomplish it. by doing so, not only can compliance administrators fulfill their monitoring obligations, they would also mitigate the likelihood that their university would face a failure to monitor allegation should other violations occur. * assistant professor of recreation and sport management at the university of arkansas, fayetteville (j.d., university of iowa college of law). prior to entering academia, lens worked on baylor university’s athletics compliance staff for eight years. in addition to his academic duties, lens consults for college athletics conferences and university athletics departments regarding legal and ncaa matters. the views this article expresses are the author’s and not necessarily representative of the university of arkansas or baylor university.
