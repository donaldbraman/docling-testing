  "international investment law provides stability for investors, helps capital flow across the globe, and can be a critical tool for sustainable development.",
  "this regime, however, has become increasingly controversial, in part due to its inability to reconcile investor obligations with competing human rights obligations.",
  "when found in breach of one of these guarantees, international investment arbitral tribunal awards are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially creating 'regulatory chill' for states that may otherwise take affirmative action to protect human rights out of concern that regulation may run afoul of their treaties' international investment provisions.",
  "some legal scholars have posited a fiduciary theory of statehood, whereby a state owes a fiduciary duty to its people, much like that in domestic corporate law.",
  "it then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders).",
  "the fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime.",
  "this framework offers a timely, pragmatic solution as the international community actively reconsiders the balance between investor protection and state sovereignty.",
  "in november 2007, the peruvian government granted a concession to bear creek mining corporation, a canadian company, to develop a silver",
  "thank you to professor steven ratner for invaluable feedback on numerous drafts of this piece and to professor julian arato for first introducing me to international investment law.",
  "the project faced strong resistance from local communities, and social opposition was fierce: the mining project's camp was looted and burned down in 2008.",
  "9 protests continued, growing increasingly violent with cities shut down, trade routes blocked, and several peruvian citizens injured or killed.",

  "peru , bear creek alleged that by revoking the concession, the peruvian government had not afforded it fair and equitable treatment.",

  "given international investment law's broad scope, there is great potential for conflict between investors' rights under international investment agreements (iia) and human rights obligations.",
  "some scholars fear the concern over running afoul of iias creates 'regulatory chill' for states that would otherwise take affirmative action to protect their populations' human rights.",
  "in examining the modern understanding of state sovereignty, this note provides a clarifying framework, proposing that iias cannot derogate a state's obligation to protect its people's human rights through regulation.",
  "many legal scholars have posited an agent-principal theory of statehood, whereby a state acts as the agent on behalf of its population.",

  "26 understanding the state as a fiduciary to its people, iias cannot be interpreted to allow states to contract away the ability to protect their populations' human rights.",

  "part i of this note evaluates the current international investment law landscape, its advantages, and its relationship with human rights.",
  "finally, part iii presents three different contexts for implementing the theory in practice, emphasizing why this is a critical moment for reform.",
  "the international centre for settlement of investment disputes (icsid) describes iias as bilateral or multilateral treaties between states, that create procedures and protections for investors from one country investing in another country.",
  "28 typical clauses contain assurances that the host government will afford investors 'fair and equitable treatment' (known as an fet clause), guarantees against expropriation of investments, and 'protection and security.' 29 in addition to substantive promises, iias typically include a provision whereby a host country submits to binding arbitration to settle a foreign investor's claim, whenever they should choose to bring one, that the host country's government violated the iia's terms.",
  "when investors have assurances of fair and equitable treatment, guarantees against expropriation, and clear recourse for dispute resolution, they will be more likely to invest in foreign jurisdictions.",
  "the european commission hailed foreign direct investment (fdi), which iias aim to facilitate, 31 as 'a driver of competitiveness and economic development.' 32 at the height of the covid-19 crisis, the world bank advocated for fdi as instrumental to developing economies' recovery.",
  "for many of the same reasons that strong contract law is important in a domestic legal system, a strong international investment regime is equally desirable.",
  "in the united states, the uniform commercial code has been widely adopted by states, 37 partly to ensure certainty that contracting parties may receive the 'benefit of the bargain' across jurisdictions.",
  "aside from customary international law, 34 which is vaguely defined and difficult to outline, 35 most international law emanates from treaties.",

  "the vast majority of these awards were made in disputes under the old generation of iias, which contain little to no guidance on damages and compensation.",
  "51 with fourteen investor claims lodged against its government at the same time, half of its gdp could become subject to investor damage awards.",
  "52 by contrast, the united states, despite having a gdp over one thousand times larger than albania's, 53 had only ten more claims against it.",
  "54 additionally, while albania has been the home country to only one claimant, the united states has been home to 234 claimants engaged in isds proceedings.",
  "but the data shows that investors disproportionately levy claims against these countries relative to the foreign investment the countries attract.",
  "latin american countries received 9.3% of global fdi in 2022, yet they were subject to 27.5% of all investor claims.",
  "49 not only are these countries disproportionately sued, but they also have lower rates of success in proceedings: developed countries won 53.6% of all cases lodged against them, while developing countries won a mere 33.3% of claims.",
  "given these inhospitable conditions for developing economies, iias have the potential to create regulatory chill where states may otherwise act in protection of their populations' human rights.",
  "instead, when referring to 'human rights,' the author means those rights enshrined in widely ratified treaties and conventions and often also adopted",
  "these regulations will have a particular financial impact on the extractive and energy sectors, which accounted for 47% of all new icsid cases in 2021.",
  "57 indeed, some experts estimate that state action across the globe in response to climate change could generate $340 billion in state liability.",

  "the remaining 34% of cases over this period were resolved via settlements, discontinuations, and findings of breach for which no damages were awarded.",
  "they are long-term treaties, often lasting indefinitely once they have entered into force, 71 covering a wide range of economic activity and industries.",
  "considering the landscape, it would be understandable if states subject to iias are hesitant to regulate for the protection of human rights such as the right to water, 66 the right of indigenous people to be consulted on matters concerning their ancestral land, 67 and the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.",
  "in suez , the tribunal merely held that the state must be equally subject to both obligations, without further guidance.",
  "69 the logical conclusion of suez appears to be that states must, in fact, pay foreign investors to regulate in protection of their populations' human rights.",

  "economic and social rights to which states have committed themselves mean that clashes between the two bodies of law are highly likely, if not certain.",
  "when human rights obligations conflict with investor rights, iias can be more clearly interpreted by understanding the state as a fiduciary.",
  "73 it provides a framework through which international investment law can be reconciled with a state's rights and obligations to protect its population's human rights.",
  "by recognizing the state as a fiduciary, stakeholders-such as treaty drafters, investors, and arbitrators-can better understand the nature of a state's authority when negotiating and entering into iias.",
  "furthermore, this theory clarifies that iias cannot be interpreted in a way that puts a domestic population's human rights in conflict with a foreign investor's rights under an iia.",
  "74 in a fiduciary relationship, one party (the trustee) is given management power over another party (the beneficiary), allowing the trustee party to make choices on behalf of the beneficiary party.",
  "75 to constrain this relationship, certain duties are placed on the trustee to ensure that they act to further the beneficiary's best interests.",
  "76 this relationship exists in many contexts, but is perhaps most recognizable in corporate governance, discussed in greater detail later in this section.",
  "applying this fiduciary relationship to the state, all actions that a state takes must be in furtherance of its population's best interests and well-being.",
  "under a fiduciary theory, strengthening human rights protections reinforces sovereignty by giving the state a more effective 'shield' with which to undertake its fiduciary obligations.",
  "indeed, international arbitrator and former international court of justice judge bruno simma considered conflicts between these two areas to be 'inevitable.'",
  "this modern notion of sovereignty stands in contrast to the debunked classical theory of sovereignty, which prioritized a state's autonomy above all else.",
  "for a more in-depth articulation of this theory, including its implications outside of international investment law, see generally fiduciaries of humanity, supra note 26.",
  "immanuel kant's political philosophy, familiar in other legal contexts and exemplified by the parent-child relationship, illustrates the normative underpinnings of the fiduciary relationship.",
  "thus, equipped with a standard for identifying these obligations, the relationship between directors and shareholders in domestic corporate law-the paradigmatic examplecan be clearly analogized to the state and its citizenry.",
  "the philosophical explanation and the analogy to corporate law clarify how the fiduciary relationship works and why it should be applied to sovereign states.",
  "78 looking at the parent-child relationship, kant argues that, due to parents' unilateral act of procreation, they owe their children a duty of care.",
  "a citizen of the world into a condition which cannot now be indifferent to them even just according to concepts of right.' 79 children have an innate right to their parents' care stemming from their intrinsic dignity as people.",
  "kant also believed there was another innate right: 'the right to as much freedom' as possible while respecting in equal measure the freedom of others.",
  "criddle and evan fox-decent argue, international law affirmatively charges states with the creation of public institutions for the protection of a population's equal freedom.",
  "of course, modern notions of democracy and popular sovereignty empower a collective population to an extent, but it would be unheard of-even paradoxical-for individuals in a democracy to opt out of government rule entirely.",
  "instead, a key feature of the fiduciary relationship is that the state exercises powers on behalf of a collective that cannot exercise those powers in an individual capacity.",
  "thus, while individuals are capable of and entitled to exercising certain tools of self-determination, some decisions require the coordinated mechanisms of the state.",
  "in addition to its philosophical underpinning, the fiduciary theory of sovereignty can be understood by analogy to fiduciary duties in domestic corporate law.",
  "85 shareholders are the owners of the company, while the board of directors oversees the corporation's overall operations and exercises management power.",
  "86 thus, like a population, shareholders' ownership power is often diffuse and difficult to exercise in coordinated and collective ways.",
  "87 thus, left unchecked, directors' management power can present an agency problem where the agent (directors) engages in opportunistic behavior at the expense of its principals (shareholders).",
  "this safeguard includes a duty of good faith, whereby directors must act in the best interests of the corporation's shareholders.",
  "government officials can have interests that differ from the citizenry that they represent-they could be courted by lobbyists, have financial stakes in certain industries, or have political aspirations such that they use their governing power to act in ways that are not to their constituency's direct benefit.",
  "as an example of a paradigmatic agency problem, imagine a director at company a who, on the side, owns his own consulting firm.",
  "when company a needs consulting services, this director may use his management power to ensure that his firm wins the consulting contract, perhaps even charging company a above-market consulting fees.",
  "in a corporate context; constraining state sovereignty with fiduciary duties can solve the problem in a government context as well.",
  "the fiduciary theory provides a clarifying alternative to the status quo for understanding the state's obligations in the international investment context.",
  "just as a company's board of directors may enter a contract on behalf of the company to benefit shareholders, states enter into iias with each other for the economic benefit of their respective populations.",
  "a tribunal cannot understand the state to have negotiated purely for the government's own benefit or with any intention to undermine its population's human rights.",
  "to contract away the ability to protect its population's human rights would require an authority or power that does not belong to the state.",
  "to draw another parallel to the private domestic law context, when a director signs documents for their company, they are not authorized to negotiate to the company's detriment or for their own interest.",
  "a court in the united states would consider this behavior a breach of the executive's fiduciary duty and could invalidate the agreement altogether.",
  "92 the fiduciary theory thus clarifies the nature of the state's authority and serves as a theoretical framework to understand the affirmative role that a state must play in protecting its population's human rights.",
  "entering into iias can invite foreign investment to stimulate the local economy, create jobs, and set clear expectations on both sides of the transaction.",
  "this issue can be remedied by using the fiduciary theory of sovereignty as a guiding framework both in interpreting the iia in question and in understanding a state's authority to negotiate the agreement in the first place.",
  "for a discussion of the idea that an investment can fall under an iia only if it is for the explicit development of the host state, see generally dai tamada, must investments contribute to the development of the host state?",

  "finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and isds as a whole through the atmospheric approach.",
  "this approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on.",
  "because iias are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace.",
  "the fiduciary theory provides not only a theoretical framework, but also an actionable path forward to lend legitimacy to an increasingly controversial legal regime.",
  "the contractual approach is the most concrete and direct way for states to implement the fiduciary theory of sovereignty in constructing iias.",
  "the premise is simple: insert specific provisions into new iias that better enables a state to regulate in protection of its population's human rights.",
  "some stakeholders have successfully advocated for new-generation iias as a tool to combat the potential tension between human rights and international investment law.",

  "these provisions would be a redundancy measure, or a 'belt and suspenders' approach, given that an explicit provision would merely affirm rather than create the state's fiduciary duty to its people.",
  "98 to include such a provision in iias, which reflect an existing notion of sovereignty, would be in line with the logic of treaties in general-memorializing obligations, preexisting or otherwise, to ensure that states receive the benefits of their bargains.",
  "this approach fits well within current trends in international investment law, with some reformers pinning their hopes on new iias entering into force.",
  "96 the fiduciary theory could serve as a guiding framework for treaty drafting, even if the treaty does not explicitly incorporate the theory.",
  "by contrast, treaty provisions enacting the fiduciary theory of sovereignty would specify situations where a state's obligations to its people prevent it from contracting at all.",
  "in addition to specific clarifying provisions, the fiduciary theory could also be fleshed out more fully in the preamble, or chapeau , which can inform a treaty's interpretation.",
  "100 by referring to the state's role as a fiduciary-to a population with known human, social, economic, and cultural rights-specific provisions may be interpreted more faithfully to the state's intent.",
  "in the negotiating and drafting stage, states could also highlight the fiduciary theory such that it makes its way into the travaux préparatoires , or drafting history, of these treaties.",
  "unctad, trends in the investment treaty regime and a reform toolbox for the energy transition , supra note 65, at 4.",
  "the contractual approach is helpful because it can constrain arbitrators and give clearer effect to a state's intention in negotiating iias.",
  "if states are better able to give effect to their rights and intentions at the treaty-drafting phase, there is lower risk of those intentions being distorted through the obtuse process of judicial interpretation.",
  "furthermore, when negotiating newgeneration iias, states may consider imposing reciprocal obligations on investors, especially as they concern the protection of human and environmental rights.",
  "102 to act as a fiduciary is to act affirmatively as a protector and only in the best interest of one's beneficiaries.",
  "thus, it may be appropriate for the state to impose reciprocal obligations onto investors to adequately satisfy its fiduciary obligations.",
  "in eco oro , the colombian government awarded a mining concession to a canadian mining company in the páramo de santurbán area.",
  "104 a decade later, the colombian supreme court struck down exceptions to the ban on mining in the páramos areas, citing a lack of public consultation.",
  "106 eco oro subsequently filed suit under the free trade agreement between canada and colombia, alleging that colombia indirectly expropriated its investment and breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment.",
  "107 in response, the colombian government argued that the exceptions clause in their agreement relieved the state of any liability.",
  "for an example of these obligations in current agreements, see supplementary act a/sa.3/12/08 adopting community rules on investment and the modalities for their implementation with ecowas, dec.",
  "that although the provision permitted the state to act to protect its environment, the exceptions clause did not relieve the state from any obligation to pay damages.",
  "it is difficult to imagine a state that is not interested in confirming its ability to comply with its international human rights obligations.",
  "but as noted above, certain countries are predominantly home to claimants; accordingly, these states may have different incentives and interests to vindicate than states that serve as repeat respondents.",
  "for example, canadian investors brought a claim against the united states, seeking $15 billion for denying the permits necessary to build the keystone pipeline.",
  "112 aside from the fact that all countries have an obligation to their citizenry to protect its human rights, all countries have an incentive to protect the exercise of their sovereignty.",
  "while the contractual approach can empower states to give more concrete effect to their intended bargains, tribunals may still find ways to interpret them narrowly or even in apparent contradiction of their express terms.",
  "by fortifying these exception-style clauses with the fiduciary theory's familiar philosophical thrust, arbitrators may be able to better understand the state's intent to protect its population's human rights.",
  "exceptions clauses do not typically give background information as to why a certain sector or measure is being excepted or excluded.",
  "the contractual approach attempts to give states more power as they negotiate iias and better constrain arbitrators whose perspectives on the parties' humanrights obligations may differ, resulting in inconsistent rulings.",
  "keeping the lesson of eco oro in mind, states should highlight the ideological thrust behind these new provisions where possible, referring to their role as fiduciaries to inform the object and purpose of their international agreements.",
  "the only plenary subjects under international law, 113 the state owes a protectorate duty to its population, and this approach accordingly prioritizes the state.",
  "through the contractual approach, a state can take control of its bargain to ensure that it is satisfying its core duty as a fiduciary: to protect the human rights of its population.",
  "by using the theory as a background understanding of what the state can contract away in negotiating an iia, arbitrators can interpret existing fair and equitable treatment (fet) clauses in accordance with human rights obligations.",
  "in bear creek , for example, the investors argued that by terminating their mining concession, the peruvian government interfered with their legitimate",
  "115 it can be unclear, however, what standard of treatment these clauses promise as they are often vaguely worded, especially in older generation iias.",
  "116 tribunals have hewed to the notion that fet clauses protect a foreign investor's 'legitimate expectations.' 117 put differently, if an investor had a legitimate reason to expect one course of action and the state takes another, the investor may have a valid claim under the constituent treaty's fet clause.",
  "119 other tribunals, by contrast, have taken a more relaxed approach in determining whether a state has committed itself to regulatory stability, going so far as to consider preexisting regulation sufficient to give investors a reasonable expectation that the state's regulatory framework will remain in place.",
  "maria rocha, martin dietrich brauch & tehtena mebratu-tsegaye, advocates say isds is necessary because domestic courts are 'inadequate,' but claims and decisions don't reveal systemic failings , colum.",
  "see florencia sarmiento & suzy nikièma, fair and equitable treatment: why it matters and what can be done 2 (2022), https://www.iisd.org/system/files/202211/fair-equitable-treatment-en.pdf [perma.cc/t5tb-cx3c].",
  "121 bear creek alleged that it had legitimate expectations that it would be able to mine in the region, and their disputes would not be resolved by merely terminating the concession.",
  "123 thus, in terminating the concession, allegedly without notice or justification, 124 bear creek could make out a claim based on the canada-peru free trade agreement's fet guarantees.",
  "human rights are just as much a part of a host state's legal framework as any other international obligation, as they come from the same sources: treaties, jus cogens , and customary international law.",
  "ecuador held that to sustain an fet claim, investors must take an objective look at a host state's legal framework when forming legitimate expectations.",
  "126 assessing this legal framework, tribunals have suggested there may be an incidental incentive that investors perform their due diligence, as the standard when forming legitimate expectations is what a prudent investor would have reason to know.",
  "note, however, that the tribunal did not rule definitively on this claim as they had already determined that the revocation of the concession constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation.",
  "but even without such an explicit endeavor, most, if not all, of the human rights the state is fiduciarily obligated to protect are well known.",
  "particularly relevant for corporations, the international labor organization (ilo) declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work requires the right to freedom of association, collective bargaining, elimination of forced and child labor, elimination of employment and occupation discrimination, and a safe and healthy working environment.",
  "131 the ilo has 187 states in its membership and considers all members, even if they have not ratified the conventions in question, [to] have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the organization, to respect, to promote and to realize, in good faith and in accordance with the constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those conventions .",
  "additionally, for a corporation to satisfy the united nations guiding principles pillar ii responsibility to respect human rights, corporations should already be aware of them.",
  "133 therefore, a human rights audit would not place new burdens on corporations to identify the specific obligations of the states in which they invest.",
  "corporations do not merely need to know what a state's human rights obligations are; they must also understand how these obligations constrain a",
  "this three-pillar framework emphasizes the state's obligation to protect human rights (pillar i) and the corporation's responsibility to respect them (pillar ii).",
  "pillar ii characterizes the responsibility to protect as merely 'avoid[ing] infringing on the human rights of others.' john ruggie (special representative of the secretary-general), guiding principles on business and human rights: implementing the united nations 'protect, respect and remedy' framework , art.",
  "with the fiduciary theory's clarification, the investor can better understand-and reasonably expect-what the state can, and more importantly, cannot contract away through an iia.",
  "consequently, contracting away the power to regulate in protection of a population's human rights through an iia is clearly outside the bounds of a state's valid exercise of sovereignty.",
  "once investors and arbitral tribunals understand the state's role as a fiduciary and the resulting constraints on its sovereignty, there can be no legitimate expectation that an iia would preclude a state from protecting its population's human rights.",
  "under a legitimate expectations analysis, the bear creek tribunal would have been required to determine whether a prudent investor would have had reason to believe that peru would preserve the concession in those circumstances, as the case law is clear that legitimate expectations must be sensitive to the situation at hand.",
  "135 given indigenous communities' right to consultation, codified in the widely ratified ilo convention 169, a prudent investor must know this human right exists.",
  "outreach to four out of the over thirty relevant communities in a language that was not their mother tongue fails to satisfy these communities' right to consultation.",
  "therefore, a prudent investor would expect that, given its inadequate attempt at consultation, the peruvian government would protect the aymara people's right to consultation.",
  "by contrast, the atmospheric approach seeks to change the norms of international investment by putting the logic of the fiduciary theory into the 'atmosphere.' this approach thus focuses on equipping all key participants with the elements required to incorporate the theory into their international investment engagements.",
  "if the fiduciary approach can inform how academics, investors, states, and practitioners think about international investment law and the state's role, it may also help to reduce the previously discussed structural barriers to the contractual and judicial approaches.",
  "a far more abstract approach than the former two, the atmospheric approach can be enacted in a myriad of ways by essentially any stakeholder.",
  "states can reference the fiduciary theory in treaty preambles, in statements made to the international community, or in iia negotiations with other states; academics can continue to reference the theory in their scholarship; and nongovernmental and civil society actors can feature the theory in their advocacy work targeted at states, arbitrators, and investors.",
  "136 perhaps most importantly, investors can consider the fiduciary theory when interacting with host state populations and when deciding whether to bring isds claims.",
  "as seen in eco oro , a treaty provision can be interpreted narrowly and in seeming contradiction to its plain meaning and purpose.",
  "138 the effectiveness of interpretive tools such as article 31(3)(c) of the vienna convention on the law of treaties 139 further depends on the willingness of a tribunal to recognize both that (a) human rights obligations constitute rules, and (b) that they are relevant to the present dispute.",
  "140 even when a tribunal acknowledges a human right's existence, as observed in suez , 141 a tribunal may still enforce conflicting obligations owed to an investor.",
  "an integral part of the solution is to reshape internationally shared norms by advancing theoretical frameworks, such as the fiduciary theory, through which more robust human rights protections can be justified.",
  "this has been part of a trend toward greater transparency in isds, enabling outside stakeholders to play a greater role and often allowing for additional 'big picture' policy arguments to be made.",

  "thinking of the state as a fiduciary may also open the door to new ways of thinking about international investors and isds.",
  "as a fiduciary to its people, the state has an affirmative obligation to further its population's best interests and protect its population's inalienable rights.",
  "this is confirmed through pillar i of the united nations guiding principles, which charges states with the responsibility to protect human rights.",
  "144 to fulfill this obligation, states may need to take positive action, such as imposing explicit obligations on foreign investors, rather than just passive protection of its population against potential human rights abuses.",
  "additionally, by understanding the overarching theory at the atmospheric level, investors are incentivized to modify their own behavior to avoid infringing on the human rights of the local population.",
  "looking again to bear creek , 142 the right to consultation has reached a clear consensus in international law, as ilo convention no.",
  "143 investors can honor this right by setting up effective community outreach mechanisms-such as operating in the population's native language and engaging all relevant communities-and thus avoid implicating the state's known fiduciary duty.",
  "the second pillar of the united nations guiding principles states that all businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights.",
  "145 a responsibility is less binding than an obligation, and respecting human rights is far more passive than affirmatively protecting human rights.",

  "to perform its fiduciary duty, the state could use iias to impose more demanding human rights obligations on international investors rather than merely attempting to defend against legal claims.",
  "through the atmospheric approach, the overarching fiduciary theory's moral underpinnings can serve as a normative basis to remedy the asymmetrical nature of international investment law.",
  "states bind themselves to guarantees against expropriation, to minimum standards of treatment, and to arbitral jurisdiction; yet very few iias require reciprocal obligations from investors.",
  "152 as mentioned earlier in the context of the contractual approach, a state may consider adding reciprocal obligations on investors to better dispatch its duty as a fiduciary.",
  "thus, given the potential gaps or weaknesses of pillar ii of the united nations guiding principles, it may be appropriate to impose reciprocal obligations onto investors.",
  "150 as seen in the international law scholarship, conceiving of the state as a fiduciary imagines it as more than a passive repository of sovereignty.",
  "this understanding is reflected in pillar i of the united nations guiding principles: the state has an affirmative obligation to protect its population's human rights.",

  "the atmospheric approach is thus an important first step to orienting states, investors, and practitioners toward a framework that prioritizes the state's protectorate role.",
  "159 urbaser initiated proceedings pursuant to the argentina-spain bilateral investment treaty, alleging an indirect expropriation and violation of fair and equitable treatment.",
  "under the fiduciary theory, the state must do more than merely defend against investor claims using its fiduciary duty as a defense.",
  "instead, to fulfill its role as a fiduciary, the state should seek justice when international investors violate a population's human rights, assuming a cause of action can be pursued through the constitutive iia.",

  "in thinking creatively about international investment law to satisfy a state's obligations as a protectorate, other methods this note explores may come into consideration.",
  "the central consequence of the atmospheric approach is that it encourages all stakeholders to consider for whom this system exists: the people.",
  "whether through treaty provisions, judicial interpretation, or a complete reimagining of the system's architecture, the atmospheric approach demands an interrogation of the entire regime.",
  "given that international investment law is a legal regime meant to encourage international investment, some might hesitate to embrace an interpretation of iias based on the fiduciary theory.",
  "the importance of iias to investors rests in their resulting stability and predictability, rather than the particular substantive guarantees that a state provides.",
  "165 given that the trend is moving toward more minimal standards of fet protection, 166 tweaks in the details of protections offered to investors do not appear to strike at the core of this regime or result in hordes of investors walking away.",

  "168 thus, investors have clear incentives to seek certainty: a system that produces systematic and dependable results is preferable to a system that erratically provides massive payouts for investors.",
  "as states increasingly question international investment law's legitimacy and abandon the regime, it is preferable to investors for the regime to adapt and survive rather than remain rigid and risk collapse.",
  "169 for example, transparency provisions are becoming increasingly common, whereby states commit to the publication and easy access of all laws and regulations potentially relevant to foreign investors.",
  "170 iias can also facilitate the entry of employees and foreign investor leadership into the country, often circumventing traditional immigration bureaucracy.",
  "171 investors stand to gain more from a robust and healthy international investment legal landscape than one in crisis, and this requires a functional reconciliation of human rights obligations with investor obligations.",
  "as mentioned in section iii.c, these approaches incentivize investors to identify and respect human rights obligations to avoid triggering a state's mandatory role as a fiduciary.",
  "part of the reason that this regime emerged in the first place was to invite investment in foreign jurisdictions by providing investors the stability they needed.",
  "the fiduciary theory provides this same stability by creating clear boundaries that must be respected, lest the state be required to intervene.",
  "although cases where human rights directly conflict with investor obligations make up a small proportion of investor-state disputes, a regime's inability to definitively order these obligations strikes at the very core of international investment law's perceived legitimacy.",

  "as seen in eco oro , all three approaches to the fiduciary theory are limited by the extent to which arbitrators embrace them.",
  "172 typically, three arbitrators are selected: one by the claimant, one by the respondent, and a chair agreed upon by the two selected arbitrators.",
  "to be selected for the next arbitration in a system with repeat players, arbitrators may be incentivized to signal sympathies one way or another.",
  "additionally, the ad hoc nature of these arbitrations can impact how arbitrators view their roles and subsequently how they rule.",
  "177 in isds, arbitrators may emphasize the resolution of the present dispute and downplay big picture issues, such as the protection of human rights.",
  "a lawyer who consistently represents claimants will likely bring this bias into arbitration, as will one who consistently represents respondents.",
  "indeed, professor mosche hirsch has noted the increasing polarization in the field, with practitioners often hewing to either pro-investor or pro-state positions.",
  "given arbitrators' 'private law, dyadic approach to decision-making, with its origins in international commercial arbitration,' 178 a regime grounded in private corporate law concepts may be embraced more readily by arbitrators.",

  "with this framework in mind, the fiduciary theory will influence tribunals less focused on public policy in their consideration of human rights obligations.",
  "arbitrators do not need to guess at the ideal policy outcomes when balancing a domestic population's human rights against an investor's rights.",
  "just as a domestic commercial arbitrator or judge can identify breaches of fiduciary duties in corporate disputes, an international investment arbitrator is equally capable.",
  "the european union has advocated for the creation of such an institution since 2015 and has even begun drafting some of its iias with explicit reference to such a court.",
  "181 additionally, the united nations commission on international trade law (uncitral), responsible for commercial law reform and international arbitration rules, released a draft proposal for such a body in 2021.",
  "although packaging a theory of human rights prioritization in private law concepts may lead to wider adoption by arbitrators, other actors may not readily embrace the fiduciary theory due to the current ad hoc system's incentives.",

  "skeptics of the fiduciary theory may point to the perverse incentives and systemic resistance of arbitrators, but this takes for granted that the system will remain in its current form.",
  "the latter two vehicles for the fiduciary theory, the judicial and atmospheric frameworks, would particularly complement this change in regime.",
  "all the judiciary approach requires to become actionable is amenable arbitrators, which will be more readily available with a standing court of arbitration.",
  "arbitrators not beholden to certain types of parties will be more free to consider the public policy implications of their decisions.",
  "it is more important than ever to disseminate theoretical frameworks through which stakeholders can understand and prioritize human rights obligations.",
  "even if those who adopt the theory are not the arbitrators of today, they may be sitting on the bench tomorrow.",
  "at its best, international investment law can facilitate economic growth, connect economies across the globe, and help states attract investment for particular industries to enhance economic resilience.",
  "184 this regime can be a tool for good, but it is fundamentally undermined by its complicated relationship with human rights.",

  "frustration is growing, and there is a real danger that this system will cease to be viable if these fundamental failures continue.",
  "by approaching international investment law with the fiduciary theory of sovereignty in mind, the regime's purpose to protect its investors' interests can be reconciled with the state's obligation to protect its population's human rights.",
  "this note offers a theory whereby a state's capacity to enter into iias is defined and constrained by its role as a trustee of its people.",
  "the state's right to act and regulate in the interest of its people and their human rights is not derogable by way of any iia because the state does not have the authority to sign away their duty to protect.",
  "through the contractual, judicial, and atmospheric approaches, the fiduciary theory can clarify exactly what the state and investors are committing when entering into an iia."
