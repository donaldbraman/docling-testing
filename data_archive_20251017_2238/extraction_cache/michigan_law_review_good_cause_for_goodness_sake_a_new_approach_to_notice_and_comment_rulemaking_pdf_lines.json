  "33 faca's requirements include procedural hurdles-such as mandatory consultation with the general services administration and ethics requirements for committee members.",
  "34 faca's formality often burdens the use of federal advisory committees with the same procedural challenges as notice and comment without addressing the transparency and accessibility issues created by both processes.",
  "faca is not suggested as an alternative to notice and comment: by definition, these committees have limited membership and do not provide an opportunity for true public comment.",
  "therefore, the agency would still have to take all the procedural steps that courts currently expect under notice and comment 37 while also going through the hurdles of assembling an advisory committee.",

  "in light of the procedural challenges created by both notice and comment and the use of federal advisory committees, many executive agencies turn instead to a process this note refers to as rolodex rulemaking.",

  "but in practice, rolodex rulemaking often replaces the meaningful public engagement the apa intended to foster through notice and comment.",
  "what results is a practice in which senior agency officials call on the stakeholders with whom they have personal relationships to inform their decisionmaking.",

  "although foia processes are widely accessible, agencies experience severe backlogs, especially when it comes to more complex requests, and are generally unable to meet deadlines due in part to the same resource challenges that cripple the notice-and-comment process.",
  "although agency officials do not use this who-do-you-know approach to replace notice and comment, it can functionally fill the engagement role.",
  "an agencywill conduct notice-and-comment processes merely pro forma to avoid any potential legal challenges but gather the intel they actually care about through these informal, relationship-based phone calls.",
  "this common practice completely undermines the purpose of notice and comment that the apa envisioned, giving an outsized role to sophisticated, well-resourced parties and dissuading agency officials from seriously considering the comments raised in the formal processes.",
  "this problem is likely to worsen in the current administration, given the trends of the first trump administration 44 and the inroads many executives have made with him since.",
  "although the apa's framers originally imagined the process as a tool to ensure 'all interested parties' have a voice in the rulemaking process to guarantee a 'democratic procedure,' 46 that vision has been corrupted on three levels.",
  "second, the complexity of the process enables groups with more resources to access the system while it remains inaccessible to others, privileging those well-resourced voices.",
  "as courts have clarified how they expect agencies to comply with noticeand-comment rulemaking, these decisions have also made clear to interested parties how to take advantage of those requirements.",
  "this development has enabled stakeholders to take advantage of notice-and-comment requirements by effectively forcing agencies to listen to them, regardless of whether their concerns are truly substantive or material.",
  "throughout the twenty-first century, agencies have moved to e-rulemaking, where the rulemaking process-including opportunities for public participation-occurs almost entirely online.",
  "47 although new technology has helped achieve those goals, that achievement has come at a price: increased mass comment campaigns.",
  "interest groups typically organize mass comment campaigns that consist of 'the submission by individuals of multiple form letters, postcards, or e-mails to an agency, each with identical or near-identical text.' 48 although mass comment campaigns existed before the technological advances of e-rulemaking, the internet has made it even easier for these organizations to overwhelm agencies with thousands of duplicative comments.",
  "49 early scholarship in the wake of these technological advances suggested that agencies would not necessarily be as responsive to these mass comment campaigns as they would be to 'sophisticated comments.' 50 however, more recent studies demonstrate that even if mass comment campaigns rarely result in substantive changes to a final rule, agencies tend to be at least procedurally responsive to these campaigns.",
  "because agencies are acutely aware of litigation risks, which could result in new, even more restrictive judge-made requirements on notice and comment, they fear what might happen if they do not at least check the box of responding to these mass comment campaigns.",
  "this hollow formality is the crux of many of the challenges facing notice and comment today: agencies are not likely to actually incorporate the substantive changes requested in a mass commentcampaign.",
  "professor mendelson provides examples of some extreme cases of mass comment campaigns, including agency rules that received upward of a million comments during the notice-and-comment process.",
  "this term is borrowed from professor nicholas bagley, who coined the phrase in his 2019 article and has spoken at length on this phenomenon.",
  "although the issue is relevant to notice and comment and the challenges discussed here, he discusses it with a broader scope as a dilemma throughout the regulatory state.",
  "for example, a group (or an individual, for that matter) could ask chatgpt to produce 3,000 comments 55 that substantively address the same concern about a rule but appear facially distinct.",
  "an agency would have to read those 3,000 comments more closely than mass email campaign comments since the ai-generated comments would not be identical, creating an even bigger drain on the agency's time and resources.",
  "if someone spreads out the submission of these comments, it makes it even harder for the agency to be sure that it is not passing over a substantive comment somewhere in the mix: the agency must read every comment to ensure nothing of cogent materiality goes overlooked.",
  "a separate but equally concerning issue with how notice and comment has devolved is the disproportionate use of the system by sophisticated parties.",
  "56 this imbalance is due to the complexity of notice and comment as a process, 57 which better-resourced groups can navigate more easily.",
  "in addition, these stakeholders are more motivated to participate because they have 'more to lose' than the broader public, who are (at least in theory) the very constituents the government aims to serve with rulemaking.",
  "the rulemaking process requires an individual or group to track an issue fairly closely to understand when and how they have the opportunity to comment, making representatives of industry and trade the most routine participants in the process.",
  "59 the average person does not check the federal register for a notice of proposed rulemaking, even if it concerns an issue they might be passionate about.",
  "advocates for the current notice-and-comment structure would likely argue that the very purpose of trade associations and advocacy groups-who commonly participate in the process-is to represent the individuals who make up the group's membership.",
  "this number, of course, is merely an example-as professor mendelson notes, supra note 47, at 1361, these numbers can skyrocket much higher.",
  "in part due to the ways in which judges have evaluated the sufficiency of an agency's response to notice and comment and in part due to behavioral observations from outsiders about what types of comments tend to prompt responses from an agency, 'interactions among members of the rulemaking community have created a highly characteristic and esoteric set of practices around writing, justifying, commenting upon, attacking, and defending new regulations.' cynthia r.",
  "but there is also a wide swath of people whose views are not represented by the kind of large organizations that tend to submit most comments received during notice and comment.",
  "the result of this pattern is that agencies are often (at least somewhat correctly) viewed as 'captured' by industry interests 61 and are, thus, less responsive to the public that the notice-and-comment process was originally intended to serve.",
  "62 this perception is exacerbated by the makeup of federal advisory committees, 63 as well as the backdoor rolodex rulemaking process.",
  "64 since industry officials have these other opportunities to make their voices heard, there is an even more serious impetus for agencies to engage the public in a way that does not privilege the same voices already amplified elsewhere in the regulatory process.",
  "told that [strict procedural rules] are essential to public accountability because they prevent factional interests from capturing agencies.' 66 in the context of notice and comment, the procedure fetish manifests through the hurdles imposed by the courts in the 1970s and '80s.",
  "67 judge-made additions to the notice-and-comment process exemplify the procedural rules bagley refers to in his scholarship, overlaying procedure on top of what was initially a bare-bones set of requirements.",
  "these procedural hurdles were designed to make an agency more responsive to the general public, rather than factional interest groups.",
  "facarequires membership balance plans (a document an agency must submit to the general services administration to demonstrate its intent to select a balanced and diverse slate of members) only for discretionary committees, but the majority of federal advisory committees are non-discretionary because of the procedural hurdles required to charter a discretionary committee.",
  "[t]he outsize participation of industry groups in notice and comment means that agencies will have a wealth of information at their disposal about the costs of agency rules and why, given certain facts about the industry, they won't accomplish very much.",
  "as tom mcgarity and ruth ruttenberg have shown, 'industry cost estimates have usually been high, sometimes by orders of magnitude, when compared to actual costs incurred.' in contrast, regulatory beneficiaries often lack the resources, the technical know-how, and the industry-specific knowledge to contradict those estimates, leaving agencies to do the best they can with the information they have.",
  "bagley here is in direct dialogue with advocates for notice and comment, who would posit that '[a]n agency's public proposal of a rule and acceptance of public comment prior to issuing the final rule can help us view the agency decision as democratic and thus essentially self-legitimating.' 70",
  "not only does the complexity of the procedure privilege industry voices, 71 but that complexity and the resulting industry capture also create mass workloads for agencies, which must parse through mass comments.",
  "as a result, agencies do not have enough time, people, or money to handle the beast that notice and comment has become.",
  "a number of legal scholars have proposed legislative reform as the solution to this problem (which could be an influx of cash or hiring authority by appropriators or authorizers or could be reforming the apa itself to make clear that the stringent notice-and-comment requirements made by the courts are not required by statute).",

  "however, even if the court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking.",
  "they should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself.",

  "see cole, supra note 10, at 1 n.4 (referring to the 'apparent circuit split' and the possibility that the supreme court might weigh in but has yet to do so).",
  "it is thus in agencies' interests to use the good cause exception alongside other methods of public engagement to justify bypassing notice and comment.",
  "although the ninth circuit has held that the exception was not created to bypass notice and comment, it did so without considering the practical challenges outlined in this note, many of which were less prevalent or apparent in 1992 when the ninth circuit made that observation.",
  "79 further, some courts have found that agencies can invoke good cause when engaging in standard notice and comment would undermine the underlying statute's purpose.",
  "80 this jurisprudence is relevant in that notice and comment as it currently exists undermines the purpose of the apa itself-to engage the entire public-because it privileges some parties over others and may even go so far as to dissuade agencies from rulemaking at all because of the procedural burden.",
  "it is easy to imagine, however, that a court could be reluctant to grant the good cause exception on the general grounds that notice and comment as a practice has become so impracticable that the agency has chosen to forgo it in a particular instance.",
  "82 therefore, it is critical that an agency employing the good cause exception to bypass notice and comment does so in tandem with alternative means of public engagement.",
  "this approach would allow an agency to present to a court both its finding that notice and comment is impracticable and the alterative mechanism(s) used to ensure that the purpose of the apa's notice-and-comment provisions is fulfilled.",
  "as to this component of the proposed solution, this note suggests that an agency model its supplemental public participation methods after a set of practices the biden administration encouraged white house units and administrative agencies to use.",
  "this report identifies a number of practices done alongside notice and comment but acknowledges that 'there are factors that may limit the effectiveness of an agency's efforts to encourage public participation, particularly through public comments .' id.",
  "84 first, an agency should bypass notice and comment altogether, 85 invoking the good cause exception under the impracticability rationale due to the technological developments that have made the comment half of notice and comment an inequitable, inefficient, and ineffective tool for public engagement.",
  "the second step is to employ other means of public engagement to demonstrate to a court that, although notice and comment is impracticable, the agency has still made efforts to ensure the level of public participation intended by the drafters of the apa.",
  "this model of public engagement should be based on a series of tools and strategies employed by the biden white house and its executive agencies from 2021 to 2025.",
  "86 although the biden administration applied these tools and strategies alongside notice-and-comment procedures, the framework they established, with some adjustments, is robust enough to stand in the place of notice and comment altogether.",
  "the biden administration's approach had three primary elements: (1) broad publicity, 87 (2) listening sessions, town hall meetings, and tribal consultations, and (3) ongoing engagement during implementation.",
  "88 the first of these prongs, broad publicity, 'used a variety of approaches to raise awareness and encourage input,' 89 reaching a far broader audience than a publication of notice in the federal register.",
  "the biden white house and its executive agencies took a modern approach to publicity, using social media posts and websites dedicated to the review of specific rules and regulations alongside direct stakeholder outreach.",
  "90 critically, this direct outreach, to be implemented in place of notice and comment, should cover a wide swath of relevant interests, reaching community members outside traditional business interests who might be impacted by the rule under consideration.",
  "a varied approach to publicity (which could include field visits to community and faith centers, schools, local nonprofits, etc.) would reach stakeholders beyond those",
  "if an agency were to implement this approach only on rules they anticipate being particularly controversial, this could give the impression that the agency is trying to avoid true public participation rather than merely address the impracticability of notice and comment.",
  "to clarify, although this note suggests that 'notice and comment' is the problem, the issues identified here are all related to the comment half of the process.",
  "there is no reason why an agency should not continue to comply with the notice half of its obligations under the apa, nor does this note argue as much.",

  "the biden administration's with the people, for the people report does not make clear if the national online dialogue was set up to skip over duplicate inputs, but an agency implementing such a platform to replace notice and comment should code the platform in a way that would receive only unique inputs to avoid a similar mass comment problem.",
  "a user could receive a message if they attempt to post an input identical to one already on the site informing them that their input has already been received and they should instead affirm the existing input to demonstrate their agreement.",

  "continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the apa's original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers' lives simpler.",
  "the strategy of invoking the good cause exception alongside modern public engagement methods to replace notice and comment will need to be battletested in court.",
  "given the evolving nature of administrative law today, 97 it seems as good a time as any for an agency to try its hand at moving the courts on this issue.",
