  "98 for instance, consider police use of internet monitoring software to identify computers that appear to be sharing digital contraband.",
  "police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer.",
  "but the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial.",
  "99 when the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a daubert or frye admissibility hearing.",
  "alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial.",

  "whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense.",
  "101 in all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct.",
  "notably, there is also a risk that criminal defense counsel might strategically demand access to sensitive information about law enforcement methods in a ploy to raise the costs of pursuing the case and 'graymail' the prosecution into dropping criminal charges.",
  "103 concern that defense counsel might undertake a graymail strategy seeking access to classified information led congress to enact the classified information procedures act (cipa).",
  "gives judges discretion to authorize redactions or substitutions of classified information and entitles the government to argue for those redactions or substitutions in a closed-door, ex parte hearing.",
  "further, beyond the baseline relevance requirements and prohibitions on frivolous motions and fishing expeditions, the strength of defendants' rights to compel access to evidence also varies considerably based on the type of motion they are making and the stage of proceeding.",
  "so, if a defendant can show a need for information at trial, then courts are more likely to prioritize the defendant's rights over countervailing secrecy interests (to, for instance, pierce any conflicting evidentiary privileges).",
  "110 in contrast, defendants' compulsory process rights are generally weaker pretrial 111 -a consequential distinction given that over ninety percent of criminal defendants plead guilty pretrial.",
  "112 hence, a defendant's pretrial subpoena may fail to defeat a conflicting secrecy interest (or pierce a conflicting evidentiary privilege) even if a trial",
  "the baseline criminal procedure rules do so in part by placing strict limits on defendants' affirmative rights to compel access to information.",
  "criminal discovery rules require defendants to show that any documents or data they seek from the government are 'material to preparing the defense,' 106 meaning the information has 'more than .",
  "some abstract logical relationship to the issues in the case' and would enable them 'significantly to alter the quantum of proof in [their] favor.' 107 criminal subpoenas require defendants to identify information with specificity and to establish in advance that the information is likely to be both relevant and admissible at trial.",
  "109 if these rules function correctly, defendants will only ever be able to compel access to information about law enforcement investigative methods that is likely to be relevant to their case-even if no privilege applies.",
  "for surveillance and investigative software in particular, a defendant's ability to persuade a court that they have a legitimate interest in access may depend on the precise information that a defendant seeks about the software and whether the results generated by law enforcement's use of that software can be verified without using software.",
  "finally, for certain limited categories of information deemed especially sensitive, privilege law provides additional protections against disclosure, and thereby against graymail as well.",
  "these heightened protections impose wellrecognized costs on the accuracy and fairness of adjudicatory outcomes because they necessarily suppress relevant evidence from the opposing party, judge, and jury alike.",
  "in the supreme court's oft-repeated words, privileges 'are in derogation of the search for truth.' 115 privilege law attempts to balance those costs against the benefits that privileges supposedly provide for social policies that are extrinsic to the truth-seeking function of the courts.",

  "yet critics have complained that courts 'apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,' 134 and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion.",

  "treatises and codes since the late-nineteenth century have described a variety of hazily defined governmental privileges that courts could easily have applied to shield investigative methods, such as a privilege for 'the channels through which information of breaches of the law reached the prosecuting authorities.' 218 john henry wigmore's influential 1905 united states evidence law treatise described 'a privilege of secrecy in general for official documents in an officer's possession .",

  "early cases developed a similar construction of governmental privilege that could easily have applied to law enforcement investigative methods alongside other sensitive information.",

  "228 to be sure, judge hand conceded that '[t]his privilege will often impose a grievous hardship, for it may deprive parties .",
  "to criminal prosecutions of power to assert their rights or to defend themselves.' 229 yet, such hardship cannot disqualify a privilege from existing because, as judge hand concluded, it is 'a consequence of any evidentiary privilege.' 230",
  "although this well-known case is frequently misread for the questionable proposition that government privileges should always yield in criminal prosecutions, rigorous scrutiny shows that it actually states the opposite and acknowledges governmental privilege in criminal cases despite the harm.",
  "coplon ultimately held that the prosecution had waived the privilege in that case by submitting the privileged information to the judge to satisfy its burden of proof on a suppression motion, which, in turn, triggered the defendant's confrontation clause right.",

  "the prosecution's objection at the 1959 trial was that 'it would be against public policy to require the public disclosure of the location of an automobile's confidential serial number, since the purpose of a confidential number is to make it difficult for car thieves to conceal thefts by altering these numbers.' 231 once again, privileges are public policy based rules for excluding evidence, so the prosecution's objection was implicitly a privilege claim.",
  "232 indeed, california courts have protected the same hidden vehicle serial numbers under the state's statutory 'official information privilege' since at least 1976.",
  "despite these challenges, the policy dilemma underlying the law enforcement privilege has clearly plagued the legal system for hundreds of years.",
  "most likely, before the phrase 'law enforcement privilege' gained prominence among federal courts, judges simply applied different labels to similar privilege rulings.",
  "as laura donohue recognized in the related context of the state secrets privilege (which many have similarly argued was invented in its modern form during the mid-twentieth century 234 ), there is a risk of overestimating the recent vintage of privileges due to absences of 'historical exposition' coupled with the challenge of researching an area of law where 'relevant documents are difficult to obtain .",

  "in what is known as a 'disclose-or-dismiss' dilemma, prosecutors faced with court orders to disclose investigative techniques must choose between jeopardizing the future efficacy of the technique by complying or dropping criminal charges and withdrawing the case.",
  "without privilege, the baseline subpoena and discovery rules would entitle defendants to information about law enforcement investigative methods by showing mere relevance, 243 meaning 'any tendency' to make a fact more or less likely than it would be without the information.",

  "another reason not to totally abolish the privilege is that it could perversely result in law enforcement maintaining the same level of secrecy through even more socially harmful means.",

  "the problem remains of how courts should assess the risk of leaks, including both their probability and their magnitude of harm.",
  "298 they can require the recipient, on pain of civil 299 and criminal contempt, to use the information solely for a particular case and to return or destroy it after the proceeding ends.",
  "300 they can require that documents be reviewed under supervision at a particular secure location, such as a scif (sensitive compartmented information facility).",
  "that distinguishes the privilege from most communications privileges, which incentivize uninhibited communications by offering a shield from both leaks and liability.",

  "attorneys or experts may leak information despite the threat of sanction, 303 and leaks can be difficult to trace and remedy.",
  "substantively, law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct poses less risk of insincerity than post-dispute testimony because it requires more foresight and deliberation to falsify.",
  "305 while both post-dispute courtroom testimony and pre-dispute conduct can be falsified, the motive to falsify is likely to increase once litigation begins.",
  "institutionally, relying on the pre-dispute conduct would leverage law enforcement's security expertise to assist judicial review, transforming a comparative weakness of the courts into a boon.",
  "the answer to this problem is simple: courts should use law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct regarding the confidentiality of the information as circumstantial evidence of an acceptable risk of leaks.",
  "as an initial matter, if law enforcement failed to take reasonable care before coming to court, then in most cases judges should be able to avoid the difficult task of digging further and simply default to ordering disclosure.",
  "second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access.",
  "courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford.",
  "if judges can craft a protective order that matches or exceeds the protections that law enforcement previously imposed, then ordering disclosure would not create a significant new risk of leaks and courts should, once again, default to ordering disclosure.",

  "perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy.",

  "regardless of the overarching institutional incentives of the judiciary, some individual judges will wish to engage in a more probing review of law enforcement secrecy claims.",
  "by maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes.",
  "finally, some readers may worry about the downstream effects of a doctrine that presumes in-court disclosures will occur under protective orders.",
  "for instance, police departments' internal misconduct records revealed under a protective order in one case may constitute brady material in another, but the protective order may impede prosecutors in the first case from disclosing the information in",
  "even setting aside the risk of leaks, once evidence is admitted at trial, a host of other access rights come into play that may cause courts to lift the protective order.",

  "the evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information."
