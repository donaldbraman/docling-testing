  "although the relevant cases place some limits on congressional spending, the supreme court has been 'less interested' in policing exercises of the spending clause, possibly to avoid overreaching into a highly political negotiation process.",
  "87 the court's disinterest in enforcement likely results from the greater agency a state has when congress creates a spending program as opposed to exercising another federal power: instead of simple preemption by federal fiat, a state can say no to the contract.",
  "rather than involving itself in every political disagreement, the federal judiciary should step in only when necessary to ensure 'healthy federalism'when congress has actually violated dole (or sebelius ).",

  "powers issue counseling for judicial restraint in striking down appropriations, coincidentally, is the precise doctrinal value underpinning article iii standing doctrine.",
  "a relatively modern doctrine, 89 standing is rooted in article iii's vague articulation of the 'judicial power' of the united states.",
  "90 the constitution extends the judicial power to specified 'cases' and 'controversies,' a phrase the supreme court has interpreted to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to only ' actual cases or controversies.' 91 federal courts do not issue advisory opinions, 92 and there is no standing 'when there are no adverse parties with personal interest in the matter.' 93 to eliminate plaintiffs and disputes without 'proper' stakes, plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they have suffered an 'injury in fact,' (2) the injury is 'fairly traceable' to the defendant's challenged conduct, and (3) the injury is 'likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.' 94",
  "95 standing circumscribes 'what activities are appropriate' for article iii courts, an 'irreducible constitutional minimum' for when a federal judge can grant jurisdiction and get involved.",
  "96 a court must refuse to resolve even a potentially meritorious claim if the plaintiff is 'not properly situated to be entitled to its judicial determination.' 97 as then-judge scalia phrased it in his influential article on the subject, standing 'is an answer to the very first question that is sometimes rudely asked when one person complains of another's actions: 'what's it to you?' ' 98",
  "injury in fact is standing's '[f]irst and foremost' element, 99 and requires plaintiffs to show the 'invasion of a legally protected interest.' 100 the supreme court has described the requirements for injury in myriad ways, 101 boiling the concept down to a number of essential characteristics: the plaintiff's injury must be 'concrete,' 'particularized,' and sufficiently 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' 102",
  "103 the question of risk is most relevant where there is a hypothetical, illegal government enforcement of a law-but no actual enforcement.",
  "plaintiffs have 'pre-enforcement' standing for such threatened injuries when they allege 'an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,' and there is a 'credible threat' that a governmental actor will stop them from doing so.",

  "113 states, however, also directly suffer sovereign injuries as a result of their unique character and not as a result of broader injuries to their citizens.",
  "114 the earliest recognized examples of such direct sovereign interests include 'the exercise of sovereign power over individuals and entities' and 'the demand for recognition from other sovereigns,' including other states.",
  "nonetheless, given federalism's unique stakes in states' suits against the federal government, the supreme court has attempted to fashion specific rules for state standing 118 -most notably in massachusetts v.",
  "part of that murkiness can come from the pleadings themselves, in which states assert multiple, overlapping theories of standing across the different categories for the same conduct.",

  "precisely how to apply special solicitude (or even how it functioned in massachusetts ) 128 has vexed scholars ever since.",
  "131 since 2007, the supreme court has not explicitly granted a state standing on special solicitude grounds, despite a number of close calls.",
  "the court disagreed, holding massachusetts's asserted injury-that 'rising seas' would 'swallow massachusetts' coastal land'-was sufficiently concrete and particularized for standing.",
  "122 although the court did credit the proprietary, non-sovereign ramifications of coastal flooding vis-a-vis massachusetts as a landowner, 123 justice stevens's majority opinion also factored massachusetts's status as a state into the court's standing analysis.",
  "124 distinguishing previous environmental cases where private plaintiffs lacked standing, stevens asserted that 'states are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.' 125 because the states 'surrender[ed] certain sovereign prerogatives' to the federal government when they entered the union, they are 'entitled to special solicitude in [the court's] standing analysis.' 126 a bare majority thereafter held that massachusetts had standing and ruled for the state on the merits-four justices dissented.",

  "247 likewise, the eighth circuit held that where there was no imminent threat to missouri's 'constitutional right to set taxes,' there was no tax power injury.",
  "as with the spending contract injury, the circuit courts disagreed on whether the tax power injury required an impending constraint of state tax authority.",
  "what's more, the courts were divided on how the two sovereign injuries interacted with each other and where special solicitude played a part in their analysis, if at all.",
  "249 instead, the court discussed the 'surrendering [of the plaintiffs'] ability to set state tax policy' as part of the spending contract injury-the power to tax is simply part of the consideration in a coercive contractual offer.",
  "250 it is entirely possible that the court would treat its analysis of ambiguity and coercion in the offset provision differently if the state were foregoing something pedestrian (and not sovereign) like contractual rights with a private party, but there is no specific discussion of how the sovereign nature of the tax power elevates plaintiffs' standing.",
  "in finding that the final rule did not moot the challenge, the court does mention the constraint of the state's sovereign powers but does not otherwise mention the constraint of that power as an independent basis for standing.",

  "instead, the spending contract and tax power injuries should adhere to the touchstones of other standing injuries-in-fact, requiring objective imminence and concreteness, respectively.",
  "as standing doctrine is theoretically supposed to ensure, the spending clause has historically been free from federal courts' excessive meddling in highly sensitive political areas.",
  "251 instead, with the offset provision cases, the majority of the circuit courts hearing those cases have welcomed the crushing weight of 'juristocracy' to yet another policy vehicle, inviting disruptive judicial activism to infect another article i power.",
  "however, if future spending clause cases follow the majority of circuit courts, the offset provision cases will have lowered pleading standards for states.",
  "as this part explains, the injuries create two new approaches for states to unilaterally block federal policy: searching and destroying ambiguity and quarantining 'sovereign' powers from federal influence.",
  "without any requirements of imminence or concreteness, states that sniff out qualifying spending conditions will always find their way into federal court.",
  "although the merits (or existence) of judicial activism is subject to academic debate, modern judicial involvement in these kinds of federalist disputes tends to bias conservative policymakers.",
  "253 the eleventh circuit's articulation in particular-that states have a live claim to 'adjudicate [the] terms' of the offset provision-grants open-ended standing.",
  "254 states could hunt for ambiguity in any new grant of federal money, insist that they 'cannot determine at what point a breach will occur' because of that ambiguity, and get standing to enjoin that provision.",
  "257 instead, the broad conception of the spending contract injury weaponizes article iii courts against all legislative ambiguity, inviting attorneys general to search and destroy even 'dormant' spending conditions like the offset provision.",
  "258 the best way to achieve this balance of federalism and the separation of powers is to look to spending clause jurisprudence.",
  "in cases like dole and sebelius , there was no question that states had standing to sue given the legislation's immediate obligations.",

  "264 courts should be wary to decide such cases involving coordinate branches of the federal government where any actual squabble has yet to materialize.",
  "pennhurst does not provide this sort of substantive attack on ambiguity; it and arlington applied a clear-statement rule of statutory construction that ensures states have fair notice of their duties and obligations after accepting federal funds.",
  "269 the rule does not create any substantive limit on federal power, 270 so it should not give states a nebulous, ambiguity-challenging cause of action.",
  "in those circuits, the courts' standing analyses went off track in part because they misapplied the substantive spending clause precedent.",
  "the fifth and eleventh circuits did not treat pennhurst 's clear-statement rule as a rule of statutory construction to protect the states from unexpected duties and suits.",
  "265 instead, as the eleventh circuit explained, they believed the pennhurst requirement incorporated in the dole rule 'is a binding constitutional command.' 266 following the 'search and destroy' theme, the fifth circuit further argued that the constitution imposes an affirmative 'bar on ambiguous spending conditions and provid[es] grounds for an injunction against the enforcement of such conditions.' 267 ignoring the supreme court's reasoning in bennett v.",

  "congress's offer is a 'gun to the head' of the states that would immediately change state policy on an issue.",
  "271 but for mere discretionary spending conditions like the offset provision, particularly one designed to ensure maintenance-of-effort, 272 states should not have standing without imminent federal enforcement.",
  "several of the offset provision opinions crafted an expansive tax power injury even if none attributed standing to that injury alone.",
  "yellen , that states have standing whenever legislation subjectively 'intrude[s]' or 'chill[s]' a state's sovereign authority to make laws (or broader yet, has 'negative effects' on a state's economy), 274 would grant near-absolute state standing to challenge federal spending.",
  "as judge bush explains in the majority opinion, ' any law could be said to 'limit the range,' in an abstract sense, of a plaintiff's legitimate behavior.' 275 federal legislation 'cast[ing] a pall over legislators' abilities to contemplate' lawmaking is far too subjective and abstract an injury for standing.",
  "276 states could always suggest that anything other than no limitations on federal funds would step on their sovereign toes.",
  "instead, the tax power injury-or, better named, the regulatory power injury, as it would not be subject-matter specific-should apply a similar distinction as outlined in the previous section.",
  "if a federal spending program restrains a state's ability to regulate -a state may not pass any tax cuts for two",
  "both the ninth and eleventh circuits appear to treat the subject matter of the offset provision, which implicates a state's ability to create and cut taxes, as a plus factor in finding standing.",
  "277 although the fifth circuit did not discuss the tax power injury directly, its reasoning on the merits is also troubling on this front, as anytime congress 'require[s] the states to accept policy changes, [it] triggers the [spending clause's] coercion analysis.' 278 this rule is unworkable for standing: standing should not be based on whether the spending condition at issue touches something 'too sovereign-y' because that standard provides judges too much unfettered discretion.",
  "the injury would also be distinct from the spending contract injury, as there would be nothing ambiguous or coercive about the federal offer ; states would be challenging the substance of the deal.",
  "states should not have standing merely because federal legislation subjectively chills their power, especially when federal regulators are not imminently constraining that power.",
  "but if the restriction is concrete, as in actual or imminent (not ' 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical' '), 280 then states should have standing to prevent the 'loss' of their lawmaking function.",
  "each of the courts that 'applied' special solicitude did so differently, often giving lip service to the doctrine or massachusetts v.",
  "the eighth circuit appeared to shrug off missouri's special solicitude, holding that it had not otherwise met 'the basic requirements for standing.' 281 by contrast, the ninth and eleventh circuits, similar to their analysis of the tax power injury, 282 referenced massachusetts v.",
  "283 based on the ninth and eleventh circuits' temporally unrestricted description of the spending contract injury, special solicitude may be helping to eliminate standing's imminence requirement.",

  "and if they somehow do, it should at least be on a more concrete doctrinal basis, rather than 'extra-credit' and judicial spitballing.",
  "the fruits of the courts' analyses, the spending contract and tax power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearly every case-regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments.",
  "the sovereign spending clause injuries are powerful tools: pleading strategies for ambitious states to destroy the federal policies they oppose.",
  "spending clause standing must have a higher standard, and special solicitude must not become a renewed red carpet for state plaintiffs."
