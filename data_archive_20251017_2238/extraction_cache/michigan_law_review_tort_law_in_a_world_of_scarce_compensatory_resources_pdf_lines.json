  "the antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs.",
  "the reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor's prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages.",
  "these normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values.",
  "an extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law-why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",
  "accounting for the availability of compensatory resources reveals normative properties of substantive tort law that are often quite different from the ones modern tort theories depict, including the relation between tort law and criminal law and the vital role deterrence plays in a rights-based tort system.",
  "an adequate account of tort law must comprehend how the scarcity of compensatory resources alters substantive tort doctrine in principled ways.",

  "1 this compensatory problem is brought into sharp relief by the supreme court's recent decision involving purdue pharma l.p.'s bankruptcy after it faced at least $40 trillion of potential tort liabilities for manufacturing and distributing oxycontin, the highly addictive pain killer largely responsible for triggering the opioid-overdose crisis.",
  "2 although the case turned on the statutory powers of federal bankruptcy courts, 3 it painfully illustrates how bankruptcy affects tort compensation.",
  "under the plan the bankruptcy court approved, 'if people experienced a potentially deadly addiction that could be linked to a purdue prescription, they may receive the minimum payout, $3,500-a paltry sum.' 4 cases like this underscore the self-evident proposition that the compensatory properties of tort law depend on the availability of compensatory resources.",
  "to be sure, this kind of problem supplies the subject matter of economics, which seeks to identify the efficient allocation of scarce resources.",
  "scarcity can be normatively relevant for other reasons, though the question remains open because no one has seriously pursued this line of analysis.",

  "any 'glaring gap' in tort theory involving liability insurance necessarily extends to the more fundamental question of how the availability of compensatory resources substantively shapes tort law.",
  "instead of tackling these issues, abraham and sharkey sidestep them by arguing that courts pretend to abide by these tort principles while ignoring them: '[c]ourts often honor the frequently followed fiction that common-law decisions are to be based on precedent and principle, not on policy considerations.",
  "mentioning the availability of liability insurance as a factor in decisions about the proper scope of tort liability would conflict with this fiction.' 10",
  "this basic question has never been adequately addressed, making it mysterious why liability insurance-and, by extension, bankruptcy-both implicates issues of funding and appropriately factors into substantive tort law.",
  "a large part of the difficulty arises from the firmly established rule that a defendant's financial ability to pay for a judgment 'is not alone sufficient to justify legal responsibility .",
  "8 liability insurance and other factors like bankruptcy affect the availability of compensatory resources and would seem to have obvious importance for tort law, but incorporating those concerns into substantive doctrine would apparently require courts to depart from timehonored tort principles.",
  "this purported fiction assumes that tort principles do not account for the availability of compensatory resources, forcing courts to ignore those principles if they want to rely on liability insurance when formulating substantive tort doctrine.",

  "11 hence there is a foundational, surprisingly neglected question of tort law that begs for analysis: are there tort principles that would enable courts to justifiably rely on bankruptcy, liability insurance, and the general availability of compensatory resources to formulate substantive tort law?",
  "after identifying the relevant noncontroversial tort principles, part i explains why courts can defensibly consider matters like insolvency and liability insurance when formulating substantive tort doctrine.",
  "to further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, part ii asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation.",
  "this thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a 'social currency' that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange.",
  "in a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury.",
  "without any injurycausing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations.",
  "the substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",
  "as i will try to demonstrate, insofar as there is a 'glaring gap' in tort theory, it involves the failure to recognize how the social fact of scarce compensatory resources fundamentally structures tort law for reasons of common-law principle.",
  "following the transition from the state of nature, the newly emergent state enforced legal obligations with ordinary money for paying taxes and the like.",
  "12 by utilizing ordinary money as a form of social currency for enforcing legal obligations within the realm of injury compensation, the common law imbued the monetary damages remedy with a duality of normative meaning that persists to this day-it is both crassly commercial and a normative measure of fair compensation.",
  "weinrib, supra note 9, at 681-82 (observing that 'the courts' tailoring of liability rules to the operation of insurance would be regarded as bizarre' in canada, an approach which conforms to 'the conception of tort law that is prevalent in non-american common-law jurisdictions').",
  "first, money is a poor substitute for bodily injury-there is not enough money to compensate for a lost life, and money does not perfectly replace broken bones or fully correct for the fundamental alteration of one's life.",
  "recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented ex ante instead of being compensated ex post with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy.",
  "the normative importance of injury prevention, in turn, justifies both punitive damages and criminal punishment for culpable forms of injury-causing behavior.",
  "the compensatory limitations of tort liability accordingly shape the criminal law, contradicting the conventional account that treats tort law as the civilized outgrowth of the punitive practices that organize the criminal law.",
  "the relevant tort principles are not the products of any particular rationale for tort liability, such as allocative efficiency or corrective justice.",
  "they instead are embedded within the normative calculus that courts necessarily and openly apply when developing substantive tort law in a principled manner.",
  "social facts involving the general availability of compensatory resources, including the spread of liability insurance, factor into this normative calculus in ways that predictably shape substantive tort law's reach, causing it to either contract or expand.",
  "as previously discussed, compensatory resources are also scarce because defendants often do not have enough money to satisfy their tort judgments.",
  "the compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment.",
  "13 debtor's prison-a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century 14 -supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability.",
  "extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant's culpability.",
  "in principle, the transformation of debtor's prison into modern bankruptcy could expand the scope of substantive tort liability, a dynamic that has never adequately factored into the leading accounts of tort law.",
  "these predictions are borne out in part v, which confirms that the scarcity of compensatory resources can persuasively explain the basic structure of",
  "coleman, debtors and creditors in america: insolvency, imprisonmentfordebt,andbankruptcy,1607-1900, at 256 (1974) ('between 1811 and the end of reconstruction most but not all of the eastern states gradually prohibited the imprisonment of defaulters except in cases of fraud and in damage suits for alimony, child support, and wrongful behavior.').",
  "modern tort law-why it employs a default rule of negligence liability sometimes supplemented by rules of strict liability and limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",
  "once one recognizes the principled ways in which the availability of compensatory resources affects substantive doctrine, the tort rules governing accidental injury have normative properties that modern tort theories have overlooked-a glaring gap if there ever was one.",
  "to identify the relevant tort principles, we must first define the basic normative problem any court confronts when developing substantive tort law in a principled manner.",
  "by first spelling out the necessary rudiments of the normative calculus for solving these problems, we can then start to figure out how substantive tort law could, in principle, be affected by the availability of compensatory resources.",
  "the foundational need for all legal rules, according to karl llewellyn, plausibly stems from the demand for a neutral third party to mediate the conflicting interests of the parties in a dispute: 'i should indeed be tempted to argue that the differentiation of anything we can perceive as law begins with this.' 15 the conflicting interests at the heart of legal disputes is underscored by guido calabresi and douglas melamed's influential analysis of legal entitlements:",
  "whenever a state is presented with the conflicting interests of two or more people, or two or more groups of people, it must decide which side to favor.",
  "absent such a decision, access to goods, services, and life itself will be decided on the basis of 'might makes right'-whoever is stronger or shrewder will win.",
  "hence the fundamental thing that law does is to decide which of the conflicting parties will be entitled to prevail.",
  "to be protected by a right, an individual must have some interest that the law prevents others from interfering with merely because doing so would further their own interests or those of society.",
  "this formulation of the tort right is set forth at the outset of the multivolume restatement (second) of torts : an individual interest that 'is protected against any form of invasion .",
  "for example, a tort right that protects the individual interest in physical security must give that interest some sort of legal priority over the duty-bearer's potentially invading or conflicting liberty interest.",
  "regardless of the underlying rationale for tort liability, any tort right necessarily prioritizes the right-holder's legally protected interest over a specified conflicting, subordinate interest of the dutybearer.",
  "an absolute right to physical security, for example, would entail a priority of that interest which prohibits risky actors from threatening it in any way.",
  "a pedestrian's legally protected interest in physical security would have absolute priority over the conflicting liberty interests of automobile drivers using the same public roadway.",
  "an absolute priority would justify negating these potentially conflicting (absolutely subordinate) liberty interests with a legal rule that prohibits driving anytime the activity would threaten injury to a pedestrianeven if the risk of injury were minuscule.",
  "an absolute right to physical security would effectively shut down wide swaths of socially valuable activities, explaining why courts have long recognized, '[m]ost of the rights of property, as well as of person, .",
  "toprioritize among conflicting interests, a tort rule must first normatively distinguish them in a manner that justifies an interpersonal priority of one interest (such as security) over another (such as liberty).",
  "although such a normative distinction ultimately derives from the underlying rationale for tort liability, once that distinction has been drawn, the resultant legal priority defines the substantive content of a tort right and its correlative duty.",
  "each right gives legal protection to an identifiable interest-one's interest in physical security, and the other's interest in the exercise of liberty.",
  "to equitably resolve conflicts between these two relative rights, tort law must fairly balance or mediate the conflicting interpersonal interests of the two interacting parties.",
  "consequently, the 'history of the law of torts has centred around the search for an adjustment between two basic interests of individuals-the interest in security and the interest in freedom of action.' 19",
  "due to these analytic properties of tort rights and their correlative duties, the normative structure of any tort problem can be defined in terms of the conflicting individual interests in question.",
  "for example, in a tort case involving an automobile driver who accidentally injured a pedestrian, the court must determine whether the pedestrian's interest in bodily security is prioritized over the driver's conflicting liberty interest.",
  "absent such a priority, tort law cannot, in principle, shift the injury costs from the plaintiff to the defendant; the loss must instead lie where it fell, absolving the defendant from liability.",
  "the 'balancing of interests' in the foregoing quote from the new york court of appeals defines the normative calculus of tort law, one that determines whether the plaintiff's injury involves an interest that is legally prioritized over the defendant's conflicting interest.",
  "as a leading torts treatise explains, '[t]his process of weighing the interests is by no means peculiar to the law of torts, but it has been carried to its greatest lengths and has received its most general conscious recognition in this field.' 23",
  "thus, although '[t]ort liability of course depends on balancing competing interests,' to 'identify an interest deserving protection does not suffice to collect damages from anyone who causes injury to that interest .",
  "is redressable in damages.' 21 relative rights grant legal protection to the conflicting interests of both the plaintiff and the defendant.",
  "the plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages only if the injury is to a legally protected interest with a relative priority over the defendant's conflicting, legally protected interest.",
  "the balancing of interests can also work in the other direction, with the defendant's interest receiving a relative priority over the plaintiff's conflicting interest, in which case the plaintiff's injury to the legally protected, subordinate interest 'does not suffice to collect damages.' 22",
  "once a loss has already occurred, 'whatever benefit might be derived from repairing the fortunes of one person is exactly offset by the harm caused through taking that amount away from another.' id.",
  "consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff's impaired interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm.",
  "'hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.' id.",
  "these special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff's protected, injured interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner.",
  "when the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.",
  "24 hence, there is no doubt that courts must develop substantive tort law by equally accounting for how a liability rule impacts the conflicting, legally protected interests of both right-holders and their correlative duty-bearers.",
  "rather than attempting to resolve this ongoing controversy about the underlying rationale for tort liability, the normative calculus of tort law is defined only in relation to a principle of formal equality that requires courts to consider how a substantive tort rule affects the conflicting interests of both rightholders and duty-bearers.",
  "for example, courts could balance conflicting interpersonal interests in security and liberty by reference to an underlying principle of substantive equality that gives everyone an equal right to selfdetermination or autonomy.",
  "this type of balancing would require courts to determine the relative importance of the conflicting security and liberty interests for individuals to lead a life of their own choosing.",
  "alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest.",
  "another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare.",
  "exactly how a tort rule balances one conflicting interest over another within the normative calculus of tort law depends on the highly contestable requirement of substantive equality and its implications for the nature of tort liability.",
  "because it does not fully determine the answers to tort questions, the normative calculus of tort law gives shape to what cass sunstein calls 'incompletely theorized agreements' that enable judges to be 'clear on the result' for the case at hand 'without agreeing on the most general theory that accounts for it.' 26 these incompletely theorized agreements are based on intermediate",
  "see ronald dworkin, sovereign virtue: the theory and practice of equality 1 (2000) ('no government is legitimate that does not show equal concern for the fate of all those citizens over whom it claims dominion and from whom it claims allegiance.').",
  "different theories of justice disagree about 'which specific kind of equality is required by the more abstract idea of treating people as equals.' will kymlicka, contemporary political philosophy: an introduction 4 (2d ed.",
  "27 as stephen smith explains, intermediate moral principles are 'more general than the particular rules that they are employed to justify,' while also being 'narrower than the foundational principle or principles that define comprehensive moral theories' for justifying tort liability.",
  "28 intermediate moral principles of fairness and reasonableness are the normative medium through which courts specify how conflicting interpersonal interests are balanced, weighed, or mediated in the normative calculus of tort law.",
  "this kind of normative reasoning enables courts to reach incompletely theorized agreements about a tort rule's fairness or reasonableness-the same kind of justificatory approach courts regularly use in other areas of the law.",
  "hence, the normative calculus of tort law can accommodate diverse conceptions about what is good or right as a matter of substantive equality, which on one view is necessary to legitimize judicial decisionmaking in a society riven by competing conceptions of fairness and justice.",
  "31 even within a tort system like the modern one that recognizes such a plurality of values, there is an identifiable normative calculus that structures substantive law.",
  "thus, in applying the normative calculus of tort law, judges need only agree that they must fairly or reasonably balance the conflicting interpersonal interests.",
  "they need not otherwise agree about the fully theorized meaning of reasonableness or fairness derived from a comprehensive rationale for tort liability, such as kantian right, liberal egalitarianism, or utilitarianism.",
  "the institutional requirement to treat 'like cases alike' then provides the mechanism that, in principle, enables courts to coherently develop tort law over time and across cases based on these incompletely theorized agreements.",
  "the normative calculus of tort law requires courts to formulate substantive tort rules by giving equal consideration to the conflicting interests of rightholders and duty-bearers.",
  "does this calculus obligate courts to consider only the interests of the individual litigants, or can they also consider the relevant class of right-holders and duty-bearers?",

  "this normative property of tort law would seem to render irrelevant the availability of compensatory resources, such as the funding provided by liability insurance.",
  "34 instead, a defendant's wealth, along with the opportunity to insure against tort liability, is relevant for attaining the efficient and fair distribution of resources across society.",
  "35 how, then, could the availability of compensatory resources be a normatively relevant factor for determining the duty a defendant in principle owed to the plaintiff right-holder?",
  "the apparently obvious negative answer to this question may explain why scholars so far have assumed that liability insurance-and by extension, the availability of compensatory resources-can factor into substantive tort law only as a matter of policy, not principle.",
  "are matters of policy, not principle,' when 'they must be tested by asking whether they advance the overall goal [of promoting the general good], not whether they give each citizen what he is entitled to have as an individual.' 32 for example, the general good might be promoted by discriminatory practices against a minority of individuals in violation of their rights.",
  "thus, to properly protect tort rights and enforce their correlative duties, '[j]udges must make their common-law decisions on grounds of principle, not policy.' 33",
  "the assumption that liability insurance only implicates policy concerns fails to recognize how tort principles can legitimately encompass a range of social considerations beyond the case at hand.",
  "describes a general right everyone is supposed to have.' 37 as a matter of formal equality, any principle for justifying a general right also applies with equal force to the correlative general duty.",

  "tort duty is categorical in nature; it applies equally to everyone within the general category of cases the duty governs.",
  "consequently, as the restatement (third) of torts explains, 'when liability depends on factors applicable to categories of actors or patterns of conduct, the appropriate rubric is duty,' which is based on 'relatively clear, categorical, bright-line rules of law applicable to a general class of cases.' 38 a principled analysis of the duty question accordingly turns on the varied social facts that are normatively relevant within the general category of cases the duty governs, an inquiry not dependent on casespecific facts such as the defendant's wealth or ownership of an insurance policy.",
  "to apply the normative calculus of tort law to the element of duty, courts must equally account for how the duty affects both the ordinary right-holder and the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases to which the right and its correlative duty apply.",
  "although conducted at a higher level of generality than the normative calculus of reasonable care, the duty inquiry involves the same sort of balancing or weighing of conflicting interpersonal interests.",
  "in a negligence case, the normative calculus of reasonable care asks whether the defendant failed to take a safety precaution and incur the associated burden on liberty that was reasonable in light of the reduced threat or risk to the plaintiff's interest in physical security.",
  "39 the underlying normative problem-the fair way to balance conflicting interpersonal interests in liberty and security-does not disappear when courts address the antecedent question of whether the defendant owed a duty of care.",
  "as applied to the element of duty, the normative calculus is simply reoriented from the individual case to the general category of cases the duty governs, thereby enabling courts to consider normatively relevant facts beyond those in the case at hand.",
  "because the normative calculus of tort law applies to both the formulation of reasonable care and to its antecedent duty, we can rely on one element to obtain normative guidance about the other.",
  "geistfeld, social value as a policy-based limitation of the ordinary duty to exercise reasonable care , 44 wake forest l.",

  "of reasonable care, an increase in the burden of exercising care makes it less likely that the precaution will be reasonable, all else being equal.",
  "41 by implication, an increase in the burden faced by the ordinary duty-bearer across the relevant category of cases makes it more difficult to justify the tort duty, whereas a decreased burden has the opposite effect, all else being equal.",
  "for the ordinary duty-bearer, any given tort duty will be more burdensome and more likely to be unreasonable in an impoverished community as compared to an affluent community, all else being equal.",
  "hence, there is a principled reason for contracting or expanding the scope of a tort duty to account for the general availability of compensatory resources.",
  "this normative attribute of the tort duty has an important implication: it explains why the duty can properly account for the availability of compensatory resources while still adhering to the principle that liability does not turn on the defendant's ability to pay for the tort judgment.",
  "the financial capacity of an individual defendant is a case-specific fact which does not properly factor into a principled evaluation of a general tort duty governing a category of cases.",
  "to apply the normative calculus of tort law in the requisite categorical manner, courts must first consider the burden the duty would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer within the relevant category of cases.",
  "courts must then compare that burden to the protection such a duty would afford the legally protected interest of the ordinary right-holder.",
  "whereas the financial capability of an individual defendant is irrelevant to this inquiry, the compensatory resources available to the ordinary duty-bearer can affect the normatively relevant burden of the duty.",
  "thus far we have identified analytic reasons, inherent in the structure of tort rights and their correlative duties, showing why the availability of compensatory resources is substantively relevant as a matter of principle.",
  "this conclusion can be tested with a conceptual analysis, or thought experiment, asking what the common law would look like under conditions of perfect injury compensation.",

  "true, all else being equal, that the reasons against taking the precaution tend to increase with its cost, whereas the reasons in favor of the precaution tend to increase with the reduction of injury likelihood or severity that the precaution would effect.",
  "if the common law would be fundamentally altered, then the scarcity of compensatory resources presumably has substantive implications for the common law of torts.",
  "this analytical approach is analogous to the one employed in the coase theorem, which analyzes tort rules under the unrealistic assumption that there are no transaction costs, thereby showing why and how transaction costs can be important for legal analysis.",
  "42 the unrealism of a modeling assumption can be an effective way to isolate the importance of that assumed factor.",
  "so, too, the unrealistic assumption of perfect injury compensation can help to show why and how the availability of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",
  "for example, in defining the meaning of 'just compensation' in the takings clause of the fifth amendment in the united states constitution, the supreme court held that 'in view of the combination of those two words,' there is 'no doubt that the compensation must be a full and perfect equivalent for the property taken.' 43 ideal compensation involves a full and perfect equivalent for the harm in question.",
  "the fundamental tort problem centers on the equitable mediation, balancing, or 'adjustment between two basic interests of individuals-the interest in security and the interest in freedom of action.' 44 in the event of liability, the defendant's subordinate liberty interest is legally responsible for harming the plaintiff's prioritized security interest.",
  "due to the normative difference between these two conflicting interests, a perfectly compensatory currency for redressing the plaintiff's injury must be socially constructed to equitably burden the defendant's liberty interest by an amount that completely redresses the plaintiff's bodily injury.",
  "1 (1960) (proving that if there are no transaction costs in a world of well-defined property rights, then the individuals who either create or are harmed by an externality will efficiently resolve their conflict regardless of how legal entitlements are initially assigned).",
  "despite the obvious unrealism of this thought experiment (as coase recognized), it has a number of important implications for how the law can address the problem of externalities in a world of transaction costs.",
  "a compensatory currency with these normative properties was utilized by ancient societies that existed prior to the emergence of centralized government, an era somewhat misleadingly called the 'state of nature.' 45 a close look at this currency shows why the compensatory ideal for bodily injury is conceptually sound.",
  "the term 'primitive money' is 'the sort one encounters in places where there are no states or markets.' 46 but as the economic anthropologist david graeber explains:",
  "instead, they are used to create, maintain, and otherwise reorganize relations between people: to arrange marriages, establish the paternity of children, head off feuds, console mourners at funerals, seek forgiveness in the case of crimes, negotiate treaties, acquire followersalmost anything but trade in yams, shovels, pigs, or jewelry.",
  "because this is a 'totally different conception of what money, or indeed an economy, is actually about,' the term 'social currenc[y]' is the label graeber gives to the medium of exchange that can normatively reorganize human relations across a variety of social settings.",
  "by reorganizing social relations in the requisite normative sense, social currency can fulfill the compensatory ideal of providing a full and perfect equivalent for bodily injury.",
  "consider, for example, the available historical materials from medieval ireland which largely consist of 'a series of law codes' that 'endlessly and meticulously' specify the amount of compensation for various injuries.",

  "the conceptual underpinning was exactly the same in either case: both revenge and compensation were articulated solely in idioms of repayment of debts and of settling scores and accounts.' 84 the revenge option gave injury victims the means to attain equitable balance when compensation would not adequately restore their lost honor.",
  "over time, the criminal law became the exclusive province of the state, leaving the victims of crime with a tort claim for monetary compensation.",
  "the rise of punitive damages within tort law then became the injury victim's surrogate to obtain retribution for reprehensible misconduct that the compensatory damages remedy could not adequately redress.",
  "but unlike its counterpart in the state of nature, the punitive remedy is embodied in an award of monetary damages.",
  "this tort remedy enables an injured victim to exact financial revenge without engaging in any violence-a civilized attribute of the tort remedy which gained further value as the market economy developed.",
  "the only wayto punish a corporate wrongdoer-the cause of widespread injury in modern society-is by inflicting financial pain through a tort award of punitive damages.",
  "these developments have led to the now conventional understanding that the early common law 'approach[ed] the field of tort through the field of crime.' 87",
  "however, the premise that tort damages are the civilized outgrowth of punitive revenge (the province of criminal law) is belied by the historical practices that entwined the two remedies.",
  "we effectively disentangled the two in our earlier thought experiment, which demonstrated how perfect compensation obviates the need for criminal punishment.",
  "88 by implication, the inherent inadequacy of monetary tort remedies generates the rationale for criminal liability: if the only legal response to murder and other forms of highly culpable injury-causing misconduct involved inadequate monetary sanctions, the public peace would be unduly threatened.",
  "hence, the need to criminally punish injury-causing behavior stems from the failure of monetary damages to adequately protect basic tort rights-a relationship between these two fields of the common law opposite from the conventional account.",
  "having historically situated the monetary damages remedy, we can now see why it is supposed to retain at least some of social currency's normative properties.",
  "tort law recognizes that these damages 'cannot restore the injured person to his previous position' and instead are supposed to 'give to the injured person some pecuniary return for what he has suffered or is likely to suffer.' 89 '[s]ome pecuniary return' for pain and suffering can be adequately compensatory only if the monetary damages serve as social currency that adequately restores plaintiffs to the same normative positions they occupied prior to their injuries.",

  "a healthy person with ordinary wealth faces substantially different choices than someone who has been made wealthy by a large compensatory damages award for lost limbs.",
  "these constraints are harms.' 92 ordinary money's capacity to enhance welfare does not perfectly satisfy the compensatory demands of a pluralist tort system that is also concerned about giving individuals a fair opportunity to lead a life of their own choosing.",
  "a financial penalty can serve as a form of interpersonal punishment only if it readjusts the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in the requisite normative sense-the defining property of social currency.",
  "in a pluralist tort system, ordinary money can function as social currency only if its commercial or commodified meaning is socially distinguishable from its normative meaning in reordering the relationship between a plaintiff and defendant.",
  "this distinction explains why the damages rule only requires 'some pecuniary return' for nonmonetary injuries rather than the amount that would fully restore the plaintiff's welfare to the pre-injury state.",
  "'some pecuniary return' can be adequately compensatory in a normative sense even if its market value does not fully restore the plaintiff's welfare to the pre-injury state.",
  "for these types of harms, 'compensatory damages are designed to place [the plaintiff] in a position substantially equivalent in a pecuniary way to that which he would have occupied had no tort been committed.' 93 one dollar of a financial loss is fully compensated by one dollar of damages, an equivalency based on the market value of a dollar and not on any further social meaning.",
  "excepting compensation for economic harms, the monetary damages remedy embodies a duality of normative meaning-it is both fully commodified and imbued with a social meaning for reordering relationships between injurers and their victims.",
  "this normative duality raises an obvious question: is it possible in a mature market economy to adequately distinguish money's commodified meaning from its normative meaning in (re)ordering social relationships?",

  "but even if commercial money can still adequately serve as a form of social currency, its ability to function in that normative manner is considerably constrained by the irreparable nature of bodily injuries and the scarcity of money.",

  "for example, john goldberg and benjamin zipursky argue that 'the point of tort law is to define and prohibit certain forms of mistreatment, and to provide victims of such mistreatment with the ability to use civil litigation to obtain redress from those who have mistreated them.' 199 in their view, the purely compensatory rule of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities does not involve any such mistreatment, making this form of liability 'so distinctive as to locate it at or beyond tort law's conceptual boundaries.' 200 however, liability insurance and a host of other developments render implausible the claim that tort liability is necessarily limited to redress for mistreatment.",
