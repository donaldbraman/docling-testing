  "in rahimi , the court concluded that section 922(g)(8)(c)(i) was consistent with the second amendment as interpreted in heller and bruen .",
  "6 in my view, this was straightforwardly correct, for three reasons that professor robert leider and i sketched out shortly before rahimi was decided.",
  "first , the second amendment (and the fourteenth amendment) protect a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms, whose scope was",
  "second , bruen ' s references to historical and analogical reasoning were a call for courts to perform a version of that general law inquiry -an inquiry into ' the law of the past ' 9 -to understand the principles under which a legislature could regulate the right to keep and bear arms.",
  "third , there was strong historical evidence that one such principle was that legislatures could limit the use of weapons by those who had been proven to be dangerous, as then-judge barrett had argued in a prominent dissenting opinion in the seventh circuit.",
  "the court reiterated that, under bruen , ' the appropriate analysis involves considering whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory tradition, ' 13 and that judges must '' apply[] faithfully the balance struck by the founding generation to modern circumstances.",

  "' thelawmustcomportwiththeprinciples underlying the second amendment, but it need not be a ' dead ringer ' or a ' historical twin.",
  "'' 15 the court then employed this methodology to quickly survey historical examples that ' con /unifb01 rm what common sense suggests: when an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.",
  "at 691 (observing that heller and bruen ' were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber ' ).",
  "18 these are fair quibbles, which professor leider and i bracketed in our earlier work, 19 but ultimately my view is that unless one is trying to distill the general law to an arti /unifb01 cially low level of abstraction, 20 the more natural inference is that legislatures could use their regulatory authorities to provide for the disarmament of dangerous people.",
  "but chief justice roberts ' s eighteen-page opinion was followed by forty-nine pages of concurrences which focused less on the fate of the statute and more on a broader question: how should the court interpret the second amendment in general, and, for that matter, the constitution in general?",
  "without the path dependence of numerous precedents, the justices see an opportunity to describe from /unifb01 rst principles how the adjudication of constitutional rights ought to work -to borrow from what they see as working well in other areas of law and to reject what they believe is not.",
  "the court ' s opinion in bruen , for instance, contained several central analogies to recent decisions championing a categorical historical approach to the first amendment; 21 it also endorsed the originalist",
  "22 and by counterpoint, the justices have also used second amendment cases to express their skepticism of doctrinal tools such as the tiers of scrutiny well known to first amendment and fourteenth amendment case law.",
  "those debates will affect not just the future of the right to keep and bear arms, but the future of many other constitutional rights as well.",
  "what they reveal is a pivotal phalanx of justices who are openly committed to two things: an originalist method of constitutional interpretation, and an opposition to judicial ' balancing ' in constitutional adjudication.",
  "but it will be trickier for the justices to maintain both of those commitments than their opinions in rahimi let on.",
  "a central debate that emerged from the rahimi opinions involved the role of judicial ' balancing ' in constitutional adjudication.",
  "justice sotomayor, who dissented in bruen , 25 penned a concurrence saying that while ' [e]ven under bruen , this is an easy case, ' she ' remain[ed] troubled by bruen ' s myopic focus on history and tradition, ' and preferred ' the means-end scrutiny that this court rejected in bruen .",
  "24 for other recent analyses of the tensions and omissions in these opinions, see stephen breyer, pragmatism or textualism , 138 harv.",
  "28 justice jackson was not on the court when bruen was decided, but her rahimi concurrence declared that she ' disagree[d] with the methodology of that decision ' and ' would have joined the dissent had i been a member of the court at that time.",
  "' 29 these justices appear to be comfortable with the second amendment balancing tests that had prevailed in the lower courts before bruen .",
  "but in rahimi , the justices who joined bruen expressed a different methodological theme -one that centered an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation and also rejected judicial balancing of constitutional rights.",
  "justices gorsuch, barrett, and kavanaugh each professed /unifb01 delity to originalist interpretations of the constitution, though each with their own spin.",
  "justice gorsuch emphasized that the constitution ' s core commands are ' the people ' s directions in the constitution -directions that are ' trapped in amber.",
  "'' 30 he amusingly co-opted this quotation from the chief justice ' s majority opinion, where the chief had emphasized that constitutional doctrine was not trapped in amber.",
  "' 32 first, ' that the meaning of constitutional text is /unifb01 xed at the time of its rati /unifb01 cation, ' 33 and second, that that meaning '' remains law until lawfully altered.",
  "'' 34 she also correctly recognized that historical evidence was relevant both to ' elucidat[ing] how contemporaries understood the text ' but also to ' the more complicated role of determining the pre-existing right that the people enshrined in our fundamental law, ' which one",
  "' 35 the second amendment protects a pre-existing right, and so we must understand history -the law of the past -to know what it is that it protects.",
  "37 justice kavanaugh /unifb01 rst stressed the importance of following the constitution ' s text in cases where it is clear and speci /unifb01 c, supplying an almost comically long list of examples from the document.",
  "38 he then discussed the importance of using history, rather than judicial policymaking, in resolving disputes about the meaning of the text in cases where it is less clear or less speci /unifb01 c.",
  "his essay ranged from the use of pre-founding background history, to founding era history probative of original meaning, to postfounding practice more relevant to liquidation, gloss, and the like.",
  "justices gorsuch, kavanaugh, and barrett all insisted that they were not deciding the merits of gun control provisions or determining the importance of the right to bear arms.",
  "justice gorsuch emphasized that it was ' the people [who] rati /unifb01 ed the second amendment ' whohaddecided that gun rights were ' vital to the preservation of life and liberty ' even though ' an arms-bearing citizenry posed some risks.",

  "professor sherif girgis highlights that the theoretical differences between justice kavanaugh and justice barrett, which ' track[ ] an old cleavage in legal conservatism, ' also explain their different attitudes toward post-rati /unifb01 cation tradition.",
  "originalist reasoning ' may sometimes be dif /unifb01 cult, ' he concluded that ' that path offers surer footing than any other this court has attempted.",
  "' 42 ' come to this court with arguments from text and history, ' he proposed, ' and we are bound to reason through them as best we can.",
  "allow judges to reign unbounded by those materials, or permit them to extrapolate their own broad new principles from those sources, and no one can have any idea how they might rule.",
  "justice kavanaugh argued that when dealing with ' vague constitutional text ' without established judicial precedent, ' there are really only two potential answers to the question of how to determine exceptions to broadly worded constitutional rights: history or policy.",
  "' 44 history was better, justice kavanaugh argued, because it ' establishes a ' criterion that is conceptually quite separate from the preferences of the judge himself.",
  "when the text is vague and the pre-rati /unifb01 cation history is elusive or inconclusive, post-rati /unifb01 cation history becomes especially important.",
  "indeed, absent precedent, there can be little else to guide a judge deciding a constitutional case in that situation, unless the judge simply defaults to his or her own policy preferences.",
  "[t]hat kind of balancing approach to constitutional interpretation departs from what framers such as madison stated, what jurists such as marshall and scalia did, what judges as umpires should strive to do, and what this court has actually done across the constitutional landscape for the last two centuries.",
  "the subjective balancing approach forces judges to act more like legislators who decide what the law should be, rather than judges who ' say what the law is.",
  "but that is not a permission slip for a judge to let constitutional analysis morph into policy preferences under the guise of a balancing test that churns out the judge ' s own policy beliefs.",
  "this shared opposition to balancing is also what drove the biggest methodological cleavage between these justices -the cleavage about how much to rely on history and tradition when the original meaning of the constitution has run out.",
  "to him, the only real choices are ' history or policy, ' 50 so judges who wish to avoid making policy decisions must use history -history to /unifb01 gure out the original meaning of the constitution, and still more history (however late in the day) to close the gap.",
  "justice barrett, by contrast, reiterated her longstanding skepticism of '' freewheeling reliance on historical practice '' 51 and rejected the view that '' tradition, ' standing alone, is dispositive.",
  "55 on justice barrett ' s more speci /unifb01 cally positivist view, judges should turn to history only when a legal rule tells them to do so -such as originalism, liquidation, stare decisis, and so on.",
  "but again, despite this important dispute between justice kavanaugh and justice barrett about the relevance of post-founding history in constitutional interpretation (a dispute in which i favor justice barrett ' s view, for what it is worth), 57 what is especially striking is",
  "57 because i share justice barrett ' s view that the central reason to follow the original meaning of the constitution is that it is the law, rather than because it is especially good at constraining judges, compare william baude, is originalism our law?",
  "both of them saw it as common ground that judges should avoid freewheeling analysis in which judges pick and choose their sources or preferred outcomes, even while they disagreed on exactly how methodologically to accomplish that goal.",
  "in my view, the justices ' willingness to embrace originalism as the central task of constitutional interpretation, and their unwillingness to embrace judicial balancing, are both very good things.",
  "one aspect of this tension, highlighted by the kavanaugh/barrett dispute, is that sometimes the original meaning of a speci /unifb01 c constitutional provision can be too hard to discern, or too indeterminate.",
  "justice kavanaugh is right that when the original meaning of the constitutional text is vague or ambiguous, judges need some way to decide the cases nonetheless, and their own policy views about the justice of the cause are not good material for /unifb01 lling the gap.",
  "especially in a world of political and judicial polarization, it is better for judges deciding constitutional cases to try to decide them on the basis of something other than their policy preferences.",
  "but justice barrett is right that ' history, ' without a more de /unifb01 ned legal methodology, is not a suf /unifb01 cient way to /unifb01 ll that gap either.",
  "and she is right that a judge, whose job is to follow the law, needs not just some gap/unifb01 ller, but a legal gap/unifb01 ller.",
  "a second aspect of this problem, which is more fundamental, is that the original understanding of constitutional rights was not hostile to balancing .",
  "among the many works of legal scholarship cited in the rahimi opinions and for that matter in the bruen opinions, perhaps the most glaring omissions were works by professors jamal greene, jud campbell, and others illustrating that many founding era",
  "58 finally, it is worth noting that justice thomas ' s dissent, while less focused on methodology, also re /unifb02 ected an opposition to the use of ' generalized principles, ' rahimi , 602 u.s.",
  "at 775 (thomas, j., dissenting), arguing that the government ' s approach -' and indeed any similar, principle-based approach -would hollow out the second amendment of any substance, ' id .",
  "it expressed concern that the majority ' s approach to synthesizing the historical materials would result in ' the exact sort of ' regulatory blank check ' that bruen warns against and the american people rati /unifb01 ed the second amendment to preclude.",
  "at and after the founding, legislatures were expected to make reasonable determinations about how to regulate individual liberty in order to better protect and preserve the liberty of all.",
  "this was a basic tenet of social contract theory that formed a backdrop to reading the constitutional bills of rights.",
  "if the legislature trenched on a constitutional right that had been expounded with speci /unifb01 city through precedent and practice, the legislation was unconstitutional.",
  "but these inquiries, especially the latter, entailed a great degree of balancing -balancing the rights of each individual against the common good.",
  "judges at the time of the enactment of the bill of rights or the fourteenth amendment lived in a different legal environment -one that could still take for granted various unwritten principles of law, even of fundamental rights, as being widely shared",
  "to be sure, there were some founding era rights that were closer to absolutes, for instance because they were grounded in a speci /unifb01 c positive law custom or because they were seen as inalienable.",
  "see campbell, natural rights and the first amendment , supra note 59, at 280 -90; see also william baude & stephen e.",
  "62 it was perhaps easier for them to apply well-settled policies of unwritten law, without worrying that in doing so they were applying the judge ' s own views , because of this generally shared legal culture.",
  "some may be skeptical that there is such a thing (if there ever was) as well-settled principles of unwritten law shared across jurisdictions.",
  "still others may believe that judges will try , but doubt that they will succeed in doing anything other than following their own hearts.",
  "if any of this is true, then today ' s originalist judges need to think harder -or at least to think differently -about how to ensure that they are neutrally and fairly adjudicating cases under our inherited constitution.",
  "de /unifb01 ned by reference to conduct to be shielded from regulations of various sorts, ' such as free speech and arms bearing.",
  "63 but there are strategies the justices can use to reduce the need for judicial balancing, if they are as serious about it as they claim.",
  "for all that the rahimi opinions denied judicial balancing, they gave almost no attention to one of the oldest and most straightforward ways of avoiding it: judicial deference.",
  "on this view, when other legal materials run out, judges should decide constitutional cases with the presumption of constitutionality -by deferring to the legislature ' s decision.",
  "first , at a conceptual level, this is a straightforward alternative to the other options canvassed in rahimi -namely, the broad use of",
  "a rule that judges should defer to legislative regulations of rights in cases of doubt does not call for judicial policymaking; it calls for judges to permit the products of legislative policymaking.",
  "and rather than defer to the traditions of a rolling period of the past, it defers to the decisions of legislators whose enactments remain law in the present.",
  "second , and importantly, some form of deference to legislators in constitutional cases is itself sanctioned by text, history and tradition.",
  "the presumption of constitutionality can potentially be stated as a correlate of the constitutional text itself: ' [i]t is simply that, as a matter of correct interpretation of the text, the proper hermeneutic principle is that indeterminacy does not warrant judicial invalidation of legislation or executive actions that fall within the range of meaning of the speci /unifb01 c text at issue.",
  "additionally, as discussed above, professors greene and campbell argue that the founding era conception of rights was one that centered on the role of legislatures, representative of the people, to regulate individual rights where necessary for the common good.",
  "66 the very idea of retaining natural rights entailed self-determination, so while judicial review was present in this system, it was limited.",
  "still further, as professor christopher green has demonstrated, in the early republic judges insisted that statutes could be set aside only when they were clearly unconstitutional, which they grew to equate with a standard of unconstitutionality beyond a ' reasonable doubt.",
  "' 68 and as professor derek webb has more recently expanded, a '' triple helix ' of judicial restraint ' -' (1) the presumption of constitutionality,",
  "65 michael stokes paulsen, the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text, so help me god: un-writing amar ' s unwritten constitution, 81 u.",
  "(2) the clear error rule, and (3) the reasonable doubt standard ' -was /unifb01 rmly ' liquidated ' over the course of the nineteenth century.",
  "to the extent that the opinions in rahimi acknowledged this approach at all they did so with an equivocal shrug.",
  "other judges will apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption in favor of the individual right in question, ' justice kavanaugh lamented.",
  "70 or they did so with a hand-waving invocation of the burden of proof: ' aregulation is constitutional only if the government af /unifb01 rmatively proves that it is ' consistent with the second amendment ' s text and historical understanding, '' justice barrett said, quoting bruen .",
  "71 but if the justices are serious about both being originalists and avoiding judicial policymaking, they would do well to more seriously contemplate the longstanding approach that their predecessors developed for doing both.",
  "72 the judicial premise was that judicial review should be exercised with delicacy because taking a judgment out of the hands of the legislature was a matter of high stakes -with no easy way to correct a mistaken decision.",
  "the legislative premise was that legislatures took very seriously their obligations to the constitution, and so legislation was only enacted after it had survived serious constitutional scrutiny.",
  "to be fair, one might conclude that this burden-shifting is entailed by bruen ' s two-part test, especially if one reads bruen to say (at ' step one ' ) that any regulation that falls within the unquali /unifb01 ed text of the second amendment is presumptively unconstitutional, and then to say that the regulation can only be saved if (at ' step two ' ) the government rebuts the presumption of unconstitutionality with historical evidence.",
  "74 indeed, the standard is suf/unifb01 ciently eyebrow raising that when the wisconsin supreme court recently employed the reasonable doubt rule to deny a religious challenge to the state ' s unemployment tax, 75 the catholic charities bureau sought certiorari on the reasonable doubt standard, arguing that it was something between ' a hortatory expression ' and simply '' dead ' in federal courts.",
  "' 76 the supreme court even brie /unifb02 y agreed to review the standard when it granted the catholic charities bureau ' s petition, but then quickly beat a retreat, amending the cert grant to include only the merits and not the presumption of constitutionality.",
  "77 perhaps that is just as well for now, as the court does not appear ready to fully appreciate the tradition of judicial deference to legislation, but this is something the anti-balancing justices will need to confront someday.",
  "in any event, even if neither law nor logic calls for a presumption of constitutionality that is so strong as to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they could still call for some presumption -at least one strand of webb ' s ' triple helix ' 78 remains unbroken.",
  "the justices should give that presumption some attention in constitutional cases and recognize that, beyond ' history or policy, ' 79 another approach to resolving close constitutional cases is to let legislatures resolve them.",
  "80 i cannot resist observing that making use of the presumption of the constitutionality more frequently would also help the court address another recurring problem it discussed in a slate of concurrences last year: ' the best processes for analyzing likelihood of success on the merits ' when considering ' emergency applications in cases .",
  "the presumption of constitutionality is simply a presumption, and it will never be able to eliminate all hard cases -at best it can only reduce them by relocating them to a new boundary.",
  "when a legislature abridged the core of an individual right, or regulated it in suf /unifb01 ciently unreasonable ways, courts would uphold individual rights by saying so.",
  "81 so beyond the presumption of constitutionality, originalist justices might engage in more searching judicial review by reviving the techniques of their forebears.",
  "in the nineteenth century, constitutional rights were seen and adjudicated partly through the lens of ' what we now call general law.",
  "though referred to by different names, this shared body of unwritten law was not derived from any enactment by a single sovereign but instead ' existed by common practice and consent among a number of sovereigns.",
  "'' 82 these general law rights were secured by the privileges or immunities clause of the fourteenth amendment and the provisions of the bill of rights that were understood to codify pre-existing customary and natural rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to keep and bear arms.",
  "judges who wish to pursue an originalist approach to rights adjudication could look to the practices and constitutional decisions of the states over time to help understand the contours of those rights.",
  "as discussed above, in the case of the right to keep and bear arms, this method could point to something very much like the approach taken in rahimi : the recognition that disarming those proven to be",
  "justice kavanaugh has expressed doubt about the usefulness of the maxim that courts ' should simply try to ' preserve the status quo, ' ' arguing that ' [t]here is no good blanket answer to the question of what the status quo is.",
  "each conception of the status quo is defensible, but there is no sound or principled reason to pick one over another.",
  "fletcher, the general common law and section 34 of the judiciary act of 1789: the example of marine insurance , 97 harv.",
  "84 but in other cases -such as permanent disarmaments, 85 the exclusion of guns from ' sensitive places, ' 86 the regulation of gun length or magazine size, 87 and so on -courts would have to make judgments about the reasonableness of the regulations, their purposes, and the burdens they impose.",
  "this approach will look uncomfortably like balancing, but it is not of the same kind as the tiers of scrutiny that justice kavanaugh seems to especially disfavor.",
  "[w]hat the traditional approach permitted was a sort of rights-based interest balancing, where the state could regulate a right for limited purposes, such as to protect the rights of others.",
  "it did not necessarily allow legislatures to restrict a right simply out of disagreement with the value of the right.",
  "and even when the legislature had the power to restrict rights out of public necessity, restrictions could not be so severe as to amount to a nulli /unifb01 cation of the right.",
  "90 rather, judges consider the history and tradition of regulation of particular individual rights under a speci /unifb01 c legal theory: the theory that those individual rights were understood to have a scope de /unifb01 ned by the principles of ' general law, ' and that these cases and statutes can be used as evidence of what those general law principles were.",
  "but as noted above, this way of thinking about the law has become so unfashionable today that it may be quite some time before judges are ready to ask it to bear all of the weight in constitutional cases.",
  "943, 948 -52 (1987) (emphasizing the sharp break between the now-familiar ' balancing ' approach that emerged in the mid-twentieth century and the traditional approach that prevailed before that).",
  "a third strategy the justices might use to avoid the balancing of individual rights is to construct a series of doctrinal rules as they decide a series of cases over time.",
  "today the court has demarked ' historic and traditional categories ' of unprotected speech that trace ' [f ]rom 1791 to the present .",
  "' 91 the original and historical understanding of free speech did not necessarily have such sharp contours between completely protected and unprotected speech, making the modern doctrine something of a translation or extrapolation.",
  "but as discussed, the original and historical understanding of free speech did not have a strong neutrality principle, instead turning on the reasonableness of legislative regulations in pursuance of the common good.",
  "93 themodern doctrine of neutrality arose in part as a reaction to the anxieties of legal realism and the need for judges to articulate more neutral principles in deciding which restrictions on speech they would uphold and which they would not.",
  "as the free speech examples show, there is often a noticeable difference between the modern doctrinal rule and the law of the past,",
  "95 i suspect that most modern free speech doctrine can still be grounded in originalism -this depends on the details of the differences, the legal changes that might justify them, and on the relationship between constitutional standards and constitutional decision procedures 96 -but it is true that it is a dif /unifb01 cult approach to justify.",
  "the second challenge is that the court has not been especially consistent in pursuing that strategy even where it claims to do so.",
  "while the bruen majority invoked the court ' s categorical historical approach to the first amendment as a favorable analogy, it downplayed the fact that other aspects of first amendment doctrine also frequently employ means-ends scrutiny through forms of heightened scrutiny that the majority and especially justice kavanaugh disfavored.",
  "just as the court ' s first amendment doctrine has not proven as categorical or rule-based as sometimes advertised, it is easy to imagine that the same thing might happen in the second amendment and other areas.",
  "the third challenge is that articulating such rules requires the court to decide a reasonably plentiful number of cases on the topic.",
  "in the past twenty years, the court has decided only /unifb01 ve second amendment cases, and has only begun to address the most basic questions about the scope of the right.",
  "after rahimi , the solicitor general asked the court to immediately resolve three pending petitions about the scope of section 922(g) ' s ban on felons possessing /unifb01 rearms, observing that the range of",
  "strauss, freedom of speech and the common-law constitution , in eternally vigilant: free speech in the modern era 33 (lee c.",
  "often captures the original meaning of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as applied to modern circumstances ' and that ' one might construct a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain ' ).",
  "101 sometimes it seems that fear of balancing might lead to a fear of opining in the /unifb01 rst place.",
  "none of these approaches are a complete and suf /unifb01 cient alternative to all kinds of judicial balancing in all cases.",
  "deference to legislatures allows legislatures to balance rights in many cases and still requires judges to decide when the legislature has gone too far.",
  "the general law approach still requires courts to compare the legislature ' s purpose in regulating the right to the scope of the burden it has imposed.",
  "the general law approach constrains balancing with a historically guided and rightsoriented approach; it makes balancing more lawful and legitimate.",
  "constructing doctrine replaces case-by-case or ad hoc balancing with the ex ante elaboration of neutral principles; it makes balancing more predictable and impersonal.",
  "indeed, analysis of these approaches in combination helps to remind us that the disfavored concept of balancing entails several different but related judicial approaches.",
  "over time, the justices may /unifb01 nd that these frameworks will let them de /unifb01 ne and avoid whatever is especially bad about balancing while accepting the parts that are inevitable or even desirable.",
  "interestingly, in rahimi the court ' s decision can be justi /unifb01 ed by all three of these approaches, perhaps in combination.",
  "the court articulated, as if through construction, the principle that legislatures may regulate /unifb01 rearms so as to disarm the dangerous.",
  "102 but of course many harder cases will await the justices where the relative power of these approaches will be put to a greater test.",
  "when we see the justices insisting on their adherence to originalism, or denying that the most powerful judges in the country engage in policymaking, we might hear ralph waldo emerson in the background: ' [t]he louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons.",
  "they invite readers to judge the judges, to see if they have lived up to their promises or fallen short.",
  "104 the opinions in rahimi lay down markers for originalism and opposition to judicial balancing, thus inviting us all to judge over the next few decades whether their authors can manage to live up to both.",
  "102 indeed, the chief methodological critique of the dissent was that the majority ' s approach would lead the government to win too many cases."
