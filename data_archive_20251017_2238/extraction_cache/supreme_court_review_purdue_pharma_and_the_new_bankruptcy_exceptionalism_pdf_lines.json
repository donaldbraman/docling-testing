  "as a result, the opinion is /unifb02 ush with exceptionalist rhetoric about expansive bankruptcy court power while the holding does not address the issue head on.",
  "instead, the court develops a new statutory canon of constraint that narrowly construes terms in the bankruptcy code -like ' appropriate, ' ' necessary, ' and ' fair and equitable ' -to cabin judicial authority in bankruptcy cases.",
  "11 this, we argue, represents a new bankruptcy exceptionalism in which broad statutory provisions that should be interpreted by their plain meaning are narrowed to constrain the powers of bankruptcy courts.",

  "the delaware court of chancery, which presides over the nation ' s most complex corporate and business governance cases, famously does.",

  "they seek to replicate the specialization of the delaware court of chancery, but without the speci /unifb01 c qualities of a court of equity.",

  "50 bankruptcy judges are not ' article iii ' judges, 51 but they are adjudicating disputes over private rights that arguably fall under the exclusive judgment power of article iii and state courts.",
  "52 this argument rests on a view that the constitution protects property and liberty interests by making article iii judges, who have lifetime tenure and salary protections, available to adjudicate private disputes among individual litigants.",
  "what is exceptional is not the power they exercise, but the fact that a non-article iii court is exercising that power.",
  "that is, when bankruptcy judges exercise equitable powers -even those based on the text of the bankruptcy code -a constitutional exceptionalist would argue they must be reined in to protect the structure created by article iii.",
  "perhaps the bankruptcy system, by granting appellate authority to district courts, is immune to some versions of this critique, but a very strong commitment to article iii exceptionalism might perceive even that to be insuf /unifb01 cient.",
  "bankruptcy courts are subject to appellate review, which should alleviate structural concerns, at least if one accepts the appellate model of judicial review.",

  "51 they are not appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and do not enjoy lifetime tenure and protected compensation.",
  "thus, while it is common to talk about the powers of bankruptcy courts, it is perhaps more technically accurate to speak of bankruptcy cases or refer to a ' bankruptcy tribunal.",
  "57 thus, although bankruptcy courts are the courts of /unifb01 rst instance for virtually all bankruptcy cases, they exercise that power as adjuncts to, and subject to the discretion of, an article iii district court judge.",
  "because bankruptcy courts are resolving private rights disputes outside of the direct control of article iii there is a risk of depriving parties of their right to a jury, forcing parties to give up choice of law rights, or coercing premature settlements.",

  "while we are skeptical of such due process arguments -for reasons set forth elsewhere 59 -they do re /unifb02 ect a recurring concern about the constitutionality of certain bankruptcy practices.",
  "the supreme court sometimes limited bankruptcy authority and sometimes accommodated broad discretion, but when the court worried that bankruptcy practice did not provide suf /unifb01 cient due process or article iii review, it considered the constitutionality of the practice head on and issued a constitutional ruling.",
  "the most direct challenge to the constitutionality of bankruptcy courts came in the early 1980s, in northern pipeline construction co.",
  "56 in certain instances, the bankruptcy court ' s judgment is advisory and only becomes /unifb01 nal after de novo review at the district court.",
  "59 bankruptcy makes jury trials available, gives parties the right to appeal adverse judgments, and absent a single bankruptcy proceeding for resolving distressed /unifb01 rms, claimants or plaintiffs who bring suit late are likely to be left with nothing.",
  "it was relevant to the justices deciding northern pipeline that bankruptcy courts were neither territorial courts nor military courts-martial and that the case in question was not a public rights dispute.",
  "62 as a result, bankruptcy courts did not, according to justice brennan ' s plurality decision, fall within any of the historic exceptions to the requirements of article iii.",
  "the northern pipeline decision led to the passage of the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of 1984 (bafja), which made bankruptcy judges ' a unit of the district court.",
  "' 64 bafja seemingly endorsed the appellate review model in which non-article iii courts can be allowed to adjudicate private disputes if certain ' jurisdictional ' facts are subject to de novo review in an article iii court.",
  "to the extent that criticisms of bankruptcy exceptionalism are aimed at bankruptcy courts (a) deciding private rights disputes and (b) lacking article iii status, it is worth noting that members of the supreme court personally contributed to making bankruptcy courts exceptional in this way.",

  "65 see merrill, supra note 53, at 944 ( ' the appellate review model -which cast article iii courts in the familiar role of reviewing records made by other tribunals and resolving questions of law -came to be seen as solving this danger of ' contamination ' of the judicial power by involvement in matters of administration.",
  "at 945 ( ' the critical point is that the tension perceived by modern commentators between the language of article iii and the use of non-article iii agencies to adjudicate disputes under federal law was largely invisible during the years when the appellate review model was adopted.",
  "' 68 thus, if bankruptcy courts are exceptional when they exercise powers that properly belong to article iii courts, that is at least partially the fault of a supreme court justice who was worried about degrading the status and prestige of non-bankruptcy article iii courts.",

  "schor , 69 was widely understood to implicate the same article iii issue that had been raised four years earlier in northern pipeline .",
  "in schor , the supreme court held that the cftc had authority to adjudicate the kinds of private law disputes that northern pipeline had held unconstitutional.",
  "congress gave the cftc the authority to adjudicate such matters, but the decision to invoke this forum is left entirely to the parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction of these matters is unaffected.",
  "in such circumstances, separation of powers concerns are diminished, for it seems self-evident that just as congress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of court or resort to arbitration without impermissible incursions on the separation of powers, congress may make available a quasijudicial mechanism through which willing parties may, at their option, elect to resolve their differences.",
  "read together, northern pipeline and schor create the impression that article iii courts must be available to hear certain private rights disputes, though the schor court carved out an exception when parties consent to a non-article iii adjudicatory forum.",

  "' 74 but these practical considerations were ' insuf /unifb01 cient to overcome the seventh amendment ' s clear command.",
  "77 thecourtlater tempered this ruling when it announced that the constitution could tolerate bankruptcy court judgments over private rights when those judgments are subject to de novo review by an article iii court.",
  "but the formal doctrine that emerged between 1982 and 2011 paints only a partial picture of bankruptcy practice in that period.",
  "despite occasionally striking down bankruptcy court judgments on constitutional grounds, for decades the supreme court and courts of appeals tolerated broad exercises of bankruptcy court authority -either by reading the language of the code broadly or by not reviewing bankruptcy court decisions.",
  "79 to that end, courts tolerated bankruptcy court innovations that allowed bankruptcy judges to blur corporate formalities, 80 order nonconsensual third-party releases, 81",

  "dismiss cases for being /unifb01 led in bad faith, 82 and approve settlements that might deviate from the strict requirements of absolute priority.",
  "83 these innovations occurred quietly as district and circuit courts tolerated bankruptcy court discretion based on the broad language of the code, and they did so while largely leaving due process and article iii concerns unaddressed.",
  "recently, however, the supreme court has begun to avoid constitutional decisions in bankruptcy cases, opting instead to narrowly construe the text of the code.",
  "84 our reading of purdue suggests this is part of a trend of reading broad provisions of the bankruptcy code narrowly to avoid constitutional questions about court structure.",
  "though the courts never explicitly say so, they have adopted something like a canon -seemingly rooted in notions of due process and structural separation of powers concerns -of narrowing the code ' s text.",
  "it argued that nearby text in the code -found in sections 1123(b)(1) -(5) -authorizes only speci /unifb01 c plan provisions dealing with claims held by the debtor.",

  "like the cases described in the previous section, the majority in purdue expressed a concern about structural issues that could be posed by third-party releases.",
  "the structural concerns stand out when the court expresses unease about a ' roving commission, ' and when it frames the question before it as one about the authority of bankruptcy courts rather than addressing the actual question before it, which dealt with the power of an article iii court presiding over a bankruptcy case .",
  "in fact, one of the most notable parts of purdue is that the case satis /unifb01 ed the article iii requirements the supreme court had established a decade earlier.",
  "as a formal matter, the bankruptcy court order had been subject to and ultimately approved under de novo review in an article iii court (here, the second circuit).",
  "89 the case thus came to the court as one not about the power of a bankruptcy court but about the power of an article iii court hearing a bankruptcy case to approve third-party releases.",

  "204, 218 -19 (2024) ( ' each of those ' other ' paragraphs authorizes a bankruptcy court to adjust claims without consent only to the extent such claims concern the debtor.",
  "from this, it follows naturally that an ' appropriate provision ' adopted pursuant to the catchall that purports to extinguish claims without consent should be similarly constrained.",

  "89 as the second circuit explained, ' the practical import of the stern issue is nonexistent given that only conclusions of law are at issue here, requiring our de novo review under any standard.",
  "92 again, the case was about whether the second circuit was endowed with the power to approve third-party releases after a de novo review.",
  "driving the point home, although the court claimed it was engaging in ordinary statutory interpretation, the majority opinion contains a number of passages that would /unifb01 t comfortably with constitutional arguments from earlier decades.",
  "for example, the majority emphasized that the third parties in purdue 94 were ' seek[ing] an injunction ' permanently and forever ' foreclosing similar suits in the future.",
  "' 95 later, the majority appears to invoke due process values by claiming that purdue ' s theory of nonconsensual third-party releases ' suggests those claims can be bargained away without the consent of those affected, as if the claims were somehow purdue ' s own property.",
  "perhaps most importantly, the majority opinion suggested that a broad theory of section 1123(b)(6) would have been inconsistent with the history and tradition of the judicial power:",
  "no one has directed us to a statute or case suggesting american courts in the past enjoyed the power in bankruptcy to discharge claims brought by nondebtors against other nondebtors, all without the consent of those affected.",
  "surely, if congress had meant to reshape traditional practice so profoundly in the present bankruptcy code, extending to courts the capacious new power the plan proponents claim, one might have expected it to say so expressly ' somewhere in the [c]ode itself.",
  "93 by contrast, the court announced that bankruptcy courts were not endowed with the power to extinguish nondebtor claims against nondebtors.",
  "94 the releases in the case were granted in favor of the members of the sackler family who had previously owned and managed the company.",
  "at 222 ( ' yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.",
  "in each of these ways, the sacklers seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits.",
  "these quotes are all framed as reasons to adopt a narrow understanding of section 1123(b)(6), but they resemble the structural arguments that had for decades persuaded the supreme court to constitutionally limit bankruptcy courts ' judgment power.",
  "for example, in pointing out that nonconsensual third-party releases would give purdue a property right in plaintiffs ' claims, the majority hints -without saying so outright -that nonconsensual third-party releases would amount to an unconstitutional taking, or at least that they would raise property-rights concerns.",
  "similarly, concerns about ' roving ' and ' limitless ' bankruptcy court powers resemble concerns that bankruptcy courts are exercising article iii powers.",
  "and the resort to history and tradition suggests that congress needs to provide a clear -in our view, impossibly clear 98 -statement if it wants to ' reshape traditional practice ' by expanding bankruptcy court powers to include the right to order nonconsensual third-party releases.",
  "those concerns all appear to have been on the minds of the justices and likely in /unifb02 uenced the court ' s interpretation of the text of the bankruptcy code.",
  "because the court did not explicitly base its ultimate decision on these concerns, we cannot prove the constitutional matters were the primary driver for the court ' s decision.",

  "by our reading, the other items listed in sections 1123(b)(1) -(5) are speci /unifb01 c things that the drafters worried might be viewed by courts as inconsistent with other provisions.",
  "beyond that option, there are not many other ways to say that parties can include any appropriate provisions in a plan as long as they are not prohibited elsewhere.",
  "justice gorsuch avoids this problem by assuming that the question is not how a drafter would grant broad authority that includes releases but rather how a drafter would speci /unifb01 cally authorize these exact types of releases.",
  "the court ' s approach requires congress to add to the section 1123(b) list as every case reveals a new option.",
  "that approach undermines the discretionary language, and, by the court ' s logic, every addition further constrains discretion and narrows the set of other appropriate provisions.",

  "again, the only provision that could possibly supply authority to include those full-satisfaction releases in a bankruptcy plan is the catchall in § 1123(b)(6).",
  "any contract-law theory would not work for full-satisfaction releases, given that holdout creditors often refuse to consent to fullsatisfaction releases.",
  "so if full-satisfaction releases are to be allowed, § 1123(b)(6) must be read to reach creditor claims against non-debtors, even without consent.",
  "one version of the full-satisfaction doctrine that might survive postpurdue scrutiny would be for courts to allow channeling injunctions that require victims to bring cases against the fund until and unless the fund runs out of money.",
  "such injunctions could be considered in aid of a rule that a tort victim is only entitled to one satisfaction 129 but would not bind victims to a release that may result in less than full payment.",

  "127 it is possible that the court will view things differently than in purdue if the litigants /unifb01 nd the right statutory authority.",
  "one argument put forward in the red river talc bankruptcy is that the authority for full-satisfaction releases (and nonconsensual releases more broadly) may lie in the all writs act.",
  "in this way, the lawyers have astutely separated the argument for releases from the bankruptcy code and from the powers of a bankruptcy judge.",
  "whether that is enough to distance the issue from the new bankruptcy exceptionalism remains to be seen, but it may be the strongest remaining argument (in the eyes of the court) for releases.",
  "the third circuit will likely af /unifb01 rm the con /unifb01 rmation of the plan pointing to some or all the grounds discussed, and the supreme court will sit this one out.",
