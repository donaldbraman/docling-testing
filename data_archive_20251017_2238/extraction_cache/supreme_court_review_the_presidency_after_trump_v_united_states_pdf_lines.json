  "one might speculate that trump ' s lawyers declined to raise the issue of separation of powers vis-à-vis congress because they viewed the argument as a defense on the merits to be raised at a different time and perhaps did not want to raise the issue at the motion to dismiss stage for fear that they would not be able to raise harlow -type immunity on interlocutory appeal.",
  "but this speculation is implausible since, as explained above, the trump team raised many other issues in the motions to dismiss that were clearly defenses and could clearly be appealed only after trial.",

  "(it is not clear why trump ' s lawyers failed to address these issues below; the best explanation appears to be, amazingly, that they just missed them.",
  "the centrality of separation of powers constraints on congress to the government ' s argument was apparent in dreeben ' s response to the /unifb01 rst question he received at oral argument.",
  "yes, justice thomas, but i think that it ' s important to put in perspective the position that we are offering the court today.",
  "the president, as the head of the article ii branch, can assert as-applied article ii objections to criminal laws that interfere with an exclusive power possessed by the president or that prevent the president from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned functions.",
  "in its brief and at oral argument, the government explained that ' the position ' it was ' offering the court ' had several discrete components.",
  "first, congress cannot interfere with the president ' s ' conclusive and preclusive, ' i.e., exclusive, powers within the jackson framework.",
  "authority to recognize foreign nations, to veto bills, to grant pardons, and to remove at will a principal of /unifb01 cer of a single-headed agency.",
  "52 second, congress also cannot enact a statute that as applied to the president would ' impede the president ' s ability to carry out his constitutionally assigned duties.",
  "third, and closely relatedly, federal courts must construe generally worded statutes to avoid serious questions of unconstitutionality under the /unifb01 rst two rationales.",
  "but other criminal statutes burden presidential power ' in such a wide range of applications ' that the president must be deemed excluded from the statute in every instance.",

  "these arguments for constitutional constraints on congress ' s power to regulate the presidency were relevant because the government maintained that congress had in fact criminalized trump ' s allegedly illegal conduct and had the constitutional authority to do so.",
  "56 thequestion of congress ' s power to regulate the presidency was thus directly implicated in the case even if not raised by the defendant or",
  "the government made a closely related if not identical argument early in its brief when explaining constitutional protections for the presidency.",
  "john sauer, claimed at oral argument that trump ' s district-court motion to dismiss based on statutory grounds, see supra note 40, set forth ' a whole panoply of clear statement rules, ' transcript of oral argument, supra note 7, at 65.",
  "but, as noted above, the motion did not in fact raise the clear statement or constitutional arguments based on separation of powers.",
  "when justice jackson noted that trump ' didn ' t raise ' the clear statement or avoidance issue below, sauer demurred and stated that the issue was ' fairly included in the question presented.",
  "as dreeben correctly noted at oral argument, the argument ' was not raised in the district court and it was not raised in the court of appeals.",
  "56 this point is implicit in the prosecution, and dreeben stated at oral argument that a ' building block of [the government ' s] submission is that congress actually did apply these criminal laws to of /unifb01 cial conduct.",
  "57 dreeben, on behalf of the government, acknowledged at oral argument that the court had ' discretion to resolve that issue.",
  "it is important to understand why constitutional constraints on congress ' s power were relevant to immunity in the criminal context in trump but were not relevant to immunity from civil suit in fitzgerald .",
  "in contrast to trump , which was premised on congressional regulation of presidential conduct, the lawsuit in fitzgerald was based on judicially implied statutory and constitutional causes of action.",
  "in recognizing a constitutionally based absolute immunity from judicial review of civil damages suits against the president, fitzgerald assumed the validity of these implied causes of action but, under the canon of constitutional avoidance, declined to address congress ' s power to create a cause of action for damages against the president.",
  "59 the court in fitzgerald thus left open the possibility that congress had the constitutional authority to enact a statute imposing civil damages liability on the president for of /unifb01 cial acts, but said not a word about how this authority might be limited by exclusive presidential power.",
  "the introduction at the supreme court of the issue of constitutional limits on congress ' s power to criminalize of /unifb01 cial presidential acts raised a conceptual dif /unifb01 culty: should such limits be treated as a defense to prosecution, or as an immunity from judicial review as in fitzgerald ?",
  "from one perspective, presidential immunity is a principle -like absolute immunity for judges, prosecutors, and legislators -that blocks ' an otherwise valid legal rule [from being] enforced against a particular defendant in a particular context.",

  "intrudes on an exclusive presidential power is invalid , it would be a defense rather than an immunity on this view.",
  "62 by contrast, one might see any constitutional constraint on adjudication, including a jackson category three constraint on congress ' s power, as a presidential ' immunity ' in the sense of a constitutional bar on federal courts proceeding against the president.",
  "the court has, in the federalism context at least, treated analogous constraints on state power to prosecute federal executive of /unifb01 cials as an ' immunity.",
  "whether the constitutional constraint on congress is treated as an ' immunity ' matters because ' the essence of absolute immunity is its possessor ' s entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct.",
  "' 64 if the constitutional constraint on congress is a defense and not an immunity, then a president may have to suffer through trial under an unconstitutional law that would not be appealable until /unifb01 nal judgment.",
  "the government had maintained this view in passing in the court of appeals and initially took that position at oral argument.",
  "but justice barrett at oral argument worried that an appeal on issues of this sort only after a jury trial and /unifb01 nal judgment may come too late to protect the president.",
  "66 dreeben acknowledged that ' the court has the authority to craft procedural rules that implement its article ii concerns.",
  "' this meant, he said, that the court could treat a president ' s protection from an unconstitutional federal statute as an issue that the trial judge could address at the outset of a case and that could be subject to interlocutory review.",
  "the government argued that its many concessions to presidential power vis-à-vis limits on congress were not implicated by the trump",
  "at the same time, the government in places treated the issue of constitutional constraints on congress ' s power to regulate the presidency as an ' immunity.",
  "' brief for the united states, supra note 47, at 4; response in opposition to defendant ' s motion to dismiss on presidential immunity grounds, supra note 40, at 35.",
  "dreeben ' s concession has a basis in fitzgerald , which had suggested that in the presidential context collateral orders could include ' serious and unsettled issues ' that ' alleg[e] a threatened breach of essential presidential prerogatives under the separation of powers.",
  "all of trump ' s conduct, it maintained, was covered by one of four validly enacted and applied federal criminal statutes.",
  "it offered its concessions as comfort to the court about the implications for the presidency of denying trump immunity in the case, and perhaps because it suspected the court would be interested in these issues even though they were not addressed by the courts below.",
  "butoncethegovernmentputtheseissuesonthecourt ' s plate, several hard questions arose -questions that did not have /unifb01 rm answers in the court ' s case law.",
  "which and how many of the separation of powers theories offered by the government applied in the case, and how?",
  "how does the court determine whether a federal criminal law unduly burdens a presidential power or prevents the president from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned duties?",
  "the proper answers to these questions are notoriously underspeci /unifb01 ed in the court ' s jurisprudence and contested among scholars.",
  "also dif /unifb01 cult and novel, as oral argument made clear, is the role the president ' s motives for conduct play in assessing these burdens, and in determining whether his action is of /unifb01 cial or unof /unifb01 cial.",
  "circuit ' s overbroad and erroneous reasoning, the supreme court should simply ' send [the case] back to the court of appeals or issue an opinion making clear that [its reasoning is] not the law.",
  "but in light of the hard and novel issues raised for the /unifb01 rst time before the court, and the rushed proceedings, the court and the country might have been better off if the court had taken the path suggested by the chief justice.",
  "instead, it issued an opinion that, while resolving relatively little and deeply ambiguous in places, amounted to perhaps the most consequential disquisition ever on the law of the presidency.",

  "it focuses primarily on the /unifb01 rst element of the court ' s immunity holding concerning the president ' s exclusive powers vis-à-vis congress.",
  "it then assesses the court ' s additional holding about the president ' s presumptive immunity for non-exclusive powers, and related issues.",
  "it described the president ' s protection from prosecution under an unconstitutional law as an ' absolute immun[ity] ' without bothering to engage the distinction between defense and immunity.",

  "after asserting without explanation that these were public and not private acts, the court ruled that the conduct implicated the president ' s exclusive authority and could not be criminalized by congress.",
  "71 it did so in part because the president ' s threatened /unifb01 ring of the acting attorney general, a central element of the charge of obstructing a congressional proceeding, implicated the president ' s exclusive removal power.",
  "72 the court also held that the effort to punish the president for obstruction due to his conversations with justice department of /unifb01 cials implicated the president ' s exclusive power over the",
  "70 justice barrett ' s concurrence defended the treatment of the constitutional limit on congressional power as an immediately appealable issue but did not characterize the issue as an immunity.",
  "the government appeared to acknowledge that the president ' s acts were of /unifb01 cial when it described them as ' of /unifb01 cial conduct that was intertwined with his private means of attaining the conspiracy ' s aim.",
  "speci /unifb01 cally, the court ruled that congress could not make it a crime for the president to obstruct a congressional proceeding based on the president ' s efforts, however corrupt, to enforce federal election law.",
  "these were the most far-reaching rulings in the decision, and some of the most far-reaching pronouncements about presidential power in the court ' s history.",
  "the jackson category three element of trump was, like jackson ' s treatment in youngstown , very light on textualism and originalism.",
  "74 the court determined that the president ' s communications with the justice department were exercises of the president ' s article ii removal power and take care duty.",
  "and that was that: both congress ' s article i powers and the courts ' article iii powers had to yield without any consideration of the scope of those powers, or how they might overlap with the president ' s own powers, and without any effort at balancing the interests or powers of the branches.",
  "this methodological approach tends to expand the category of exclusive presidential power because it does not consider any countervailing factor once an act is deemed to be an exercise of the exclusive presidential power.",
  "the approach is particularly signi /unifb01 cant because it goes to the underlying legality of presidential action and because the court married it to novel extensions of the president ' s removal power and law enforcement discretion.",
  "the court in three decisions before trump had expanded the president ' s exclusive removal power in the face of statutory for-cause restrictions on presidential /unifb01 rings.",
  "at 608 ( ' [o]nce it is determined that the president acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.",
  "court described its precedents as recognizing ' only two exceptions to the president ' s unrestricted removal power ' : ' one for multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power, and one for inferior of /unifb01 cers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority.",
  "78 but the decision extends the president ' s exclusive removal power beyond its traditional domain of resisting forcause limits on /unifb01 rings to a different context.",
  "the court applied this exclusive power to deny congress the authority to criminalize a president ' s use of the removal power to obstruct a congressional proceeding.",
  "but its logic appears to disable congress from punishing the president for /unifb01 ring or threatening to /unifb01 re a subordinate of /unifb01 cial in an effort to facilitate any crime.",
  "congress now might be unable, for example, to criminalize a president ' s threatened or actual termination of a senior subordinate in order to obstruct justice or to use unlawful force or, possibly, to facilitate a bribe.",
  "i qualify this conclusion with respect to bribery because of an exchange between the chief justice and justice barrett about whether and how a president could be prosecuted for bribery, which opened up a possible yet ill-de /unifb01 ned loophole to the majority ' s conclusion about exclusive presidential powers.",
  "78 the court in trump stated that ' congress lacks authority to control the president ' s ' unrestricted power of removal ' with respect to ' executive of /unifb01 cers of the united states whom he has appointed, '' with a ' cf.",
  "79 the same logic appears to apply to other exclusive powers -for example, a presidential pardon in an effort to obstruct justice would not seem to be something congress could criminalize.",
  "80 the chief justice maintained that the government could not introduce evidence of a president ' s of /unifb01 cial acts that were protected by immunity to prove crimes involving unprotected conduct.",
  "justice barrett disagreed, arguing that a president could be prosecuted (for example) for the crime of bribery because the constitution ' does not authorize a president to seek or accept bribes ' and maintained that ' excluding from trial any mention of the of /unifb01 cial act connected to the bribe would hamstring the prosecution.",
  "the chief justice replied that ' the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact that the president performed the of /unifb01 cial act ' and ' may admit evidence of what the president allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to receive or accept in return for being in /unifb02 uenced in the performance of the act ' but may not ' admit testimony or private records of the president or his advisers probing the of /unifb01 cial act itself.",
  "important caveat, the court ' s removal holding is a signi /unifb01 cant and never-before-hinted-at expansion of the president ' s removal power that was nowhere briefed nor publicly discussed before the ruling.",
  "third, a broader and even more signi /unifb01 cant holding is that the president has ' exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the justice department and its of /unifb01 cials.",
  "' 82 the court ostensibly tied this power to the article ii command that the president shall ' take care that the laws be faithfully executed.",
  "it cited cases about the president ' s broad civil and criminal law enforcement discretion that were inapposite because the court had recognized that this discretion was subject to at least some forms of congressional regulation.",
  "the court had previously ruled, for example, that congress could ' limit an agency ' s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities or by circumscribing an agency ' s power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.",
