<p>The debate about how to regulate dominant technology platforms and, more generally, dangers in the increasingly important technology sector, misses an essential dimension. It is the same oversight that financial regulators committed prior to the Global Financial Crisis: under-appreciating systemic risk.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967339"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-1" href="#post-8599-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> Fortunately, the responses those regulators eventually developed provide a template to avoid a similar disaster in tech.</p>
<p>For all the fire and fury, discussions about reining in “Big Tech” cover a limited set of policy concerns. Addressing them could under-solve important challenges that technology platforms pose. These issues—information quality, privacy, and antitrust—are important.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968307"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-8599-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> But each of them has become, in different ways, partisan and logjammed.</p>
<p>We think that an exclusive focus on these issues comes at a cost. In particular, it displaces thinking about the costs if these firms fail. Our dissatisfaction with the existing technology ecosystem should not induce us to ignore its vulnerabilities. Technology platforms have reached the point where they are so interconnected, and so essential to the functioning of modern life, that their failures could be more than an inconvenience. They could be catastrophic. Moreover, these failures will not necessarily occur where we expect. Seemingly small platforms may have disproportionate significance, and seemingly safe ones may fail through unanticipated interaction effects.</p>
<p>There is a model of a regulatory regime that takes the question of systemic resilience as its <em>raison d’être</em>. Financial regulation is designed to promote the safety and soundness of institutions, as well as to protect the consumers who depend on those institutions.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-8599-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> Financial stability and systemic risk have become watchwords of the post-financial crisis regulatory settlement in the United States.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-4" href="#post-8599-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In our view, the financial-regulation paradigm can usefully be applied to significant risks of our current technological environment in a way that could promote stability and resilience. This approach would appeal across the political spectrum as a means to reduce the likelihood of a technology disaster.</p>
<p>In particular, we propose two steps. First, we recommend that technology regulators use the paradigm that financial regulators use to identify firms of systemic importance.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-5" href="#post-8599-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup> Those regulators evaluate a number of factors to identify firms capable of damaging the financial system, including size, interconnectedness, substitutability, leverage, and other characteristics.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-6" href="#post-8599-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> Firms that meet the test for systemic importance would be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-7" href="#post-8599-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, we recommend that federal technology regulators join a council that meets regularly to discuss and identify issues of systemic risk in technology, adopting the framework of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC, or the Council) created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-8" href="#post-8599-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our proposal offers a number of advantages over the current system. It consolidates a balkanized regulatory landscape and rationalizes a regulatory mission. It offers a different perspective on technology regulation, one that addresses real problems that have—so far—bedeviled both important technology firms and their government minders. It takes the best features of a resilience regime that successfully managed to pass a stern test during the COVID-19 pandemic and applies those features to a critical new part of the economy. In what follows, we make the case for the systemic importance of parts of the technology industry, outline the systemic-stability oversight regime in financial regulation, and describe how we would apply that model to technology. We propose a designation process for systemically important network institutions, or SINIs, and outline our vision for the Technology Stability Oversight Council, or TechSOC.</p>

<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc91683462"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91703750"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582964"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531164"></a> 1. Size and Scale</h4>
<p>We all know Big Tech is big. Just how big and important, and in how many ways, is striking.</p>
<p>Seven of the world’s nine most valuable companies by market capitalization in 2021 were technology platforms, including the American “GAFAM” quintet (Google/Alphabet, Apple, Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) and the Chinese giants Tencent and Alibaba.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-9" href="#post-8599-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup> And if anything, this understates the case. GAFAM alone represent more than one-fifth of the entire value of the Standard &amp; Poor’s index of the 500 largest American companies.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-10" href="#post-8599-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup> And market value is not the only measure on which Big Tech is big. Apple and Amazon trail only Walmart on the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies by revenue.<a id="post-8599-_Ref126760593"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-11" href="#post-8599-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup> Facebook’s 2.85 billion monthly active users in the first quarter of 2021 represent a third of the world’s population, and 1.88 billion of those users access Facebook daily.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-12" href="#post-8599-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup> Amazon employs more than 950,000 Americans and 1.3 million people worldwide.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-13" href="#post-8599-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup> Despite a global pandemic—or perhaps in part because of it—Google reported quarterly profits of nearly $18 billion in April 2021, its third straight quarter of record profits.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-14" href="#post-8599-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup> Consider how few companies even generate that number in revenues over an entire year. The other dominant platforms have similarly gaudy statistics.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-15" href="#post-8599-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Major tech markets are marked not only by huge firms but also by significant market concentration. Google’s market share in search is roughly 90% worldwide, despite the efforts of major competitors such as Microsoft and Yahoo! over a period of many years.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-16" href="#post-8599-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup> Facebook similarly dominates social media, where Google itself abandoned its competitive effort, Google+, in 2018.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-17" href="#post-8599-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup> Whether these or the other Big Tech behemoths enjoy market power or monopoly status under the formal measures of antitrust is a question that regulators and economists have struggled with.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-18" href="#post-8599-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup> Other significant firms in these markets such as Snapchat and TikTok have managed to avoid being crushed, although they remain far smaller than the GAFAM members.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-19" href="#post-8599-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup> And those five firms compete against each other in various areas. In colloquial terms, however, there is no question that each has staked out a market area in which it reigns supreme. And while much of their growth is organic, these firms have also acquired hundreds of startups and complementary companies.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-20" href="#post-8599-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup> It is difficult to think of any historical corporate entity or group of entities, from the East India Company to the Ma Bell AT&amp;T monopoly, which coordinated the lives of so great a fraction of humanity.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-21" href="#post-8599-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>One reason major tech companies are so powerful is that they function as digital platforms.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-22" href="#post-8599-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> That makes them “[m]ultisided markets” with strong network effects.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967979"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-23" href="#post-8599-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup> This is particularly true for advertising-based business models, in which access to the users on one side is effectively sold to the advertisers on the other side. The more users, the more data about them. The more data, the better the algorithms for targeted advertising. The better the advertising results, the more that advertisers will be locked in as well. It is a powerful cycle driven by network effects.</p>
<p>With billions of users engaging in trillions of transactions, the major tech platforms have created historically unprecedented systems of data collection and behavioral targeting.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-24" href="#post-8599-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup> And that is just the starting point. Increasingly powerful computers allow those companies to refine the raw data to generate new insights. Facebook, for example, is building the world’s fastest supercomputer to power its artificial intelligence initiatives.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-25" href="#post-8599-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup> The big platforms also have data-sharing relationships with hundreds of other companies and purchase data from the massive and lightly regulated world of data brokers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-26" href="#post-8599-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another dimension of digital platforms is that they are foundations for other services and companies. Platform operators create application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow others to interconnect. These relationships either generate revenues, provide access to new data, or reinforce the lock-in of the core service. For example, Google’s mapping service is an essential foundation for a plethora of location-oriented firms.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95727230"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-27" href="#post-8599-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup> Ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, although they eventually created their own mapping technology, would never have gotten off the ground without piggybacking on Google Maps.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-28" href="#post-8599-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup> Apple’s iOS App Store hosts nearly two million applications, virtually all created by unaffiliated developers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-29" href="#post-8599-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup> This model streamlines development and distribution for application creators, but it is also extremely lucrative for Apple, whose non-hardware (services) revenue grew to $68 billion in fiscal year 2021.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-30" href="#post-8599-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup> Anyone challenging Apple (or Google’s Android platform) has to compete not only against the installed base of devices but against the entire platform ecosystem.</p>
<p>These business models, resulting in growth on growth, mean that the largest tech giants provide services to billions.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-31" href="#post-8599-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup> As ever more of our activity moves online, these giants have become essential conduits through which modern commerce and social interaction flows. Their path to such scale is in many ways controversial, but the scale illustrates the importance of these firms.</p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc91683463"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91703751"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582965"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531165"></a> 2. Vital Services</h4>
<p>Every firm ranked at the very top in terms of employees, revenues, or market capitalization is important, but their importance is not a linear function of those numbers. Major tech firms have importance above and beyond their size. The large platforms have become increasingly critical, but the businesses on which they rely, or that they facilitate, have also become vital.</p>
<p>Consider Facebook.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-32" href="#post-8599-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup> The fact that it has so many users tells only part of the story. Those users are entrusting their personal information, images, communications, and relationship structures to the social media platform. We trust Facebook with these valuable assets, much as we trust a bank with our savings, despite growing unease about Facebook’s business practices. Facebook has become the way that people stay in touch with family and friends, interact with their social groups or communities, and find products or services. In the words of Nikita Aggarwal and Carl Öhman, “Facebook has, in large parts of the world, become the <em>de facto</em> online platform for communication and social interaction.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-33" href="#post-8599-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>And it is not just Facebook. Google, whose mission statement boldly states its goal “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” long ago became a verb because of its inescapable role in the contemporary ecology of knowledge.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-34" href="#post-8599-footnote-34">[34]</a></sup> Apple’s iPhone kicked off the mobile internet revolution and is perhaps the defining product of the twenty-first century so far because of how often so many people around the world use it (or similar devices built on Google’s Android operating system).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-35" href="#post-8599-footnote-35">[35]</a></sup> Amazon transformed commerce and became an essential source of products for the vast majority of Americans.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967373"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-36" href="#post-8599-footnote-36">[36]</a></sup> Twitter, despite having “only” 436 million users and a market cap about eleven times smaller than Facebook prior to its sale to Elon Musk, nonetheless occupies a central role in certain aspects of information generation and sharing, as evidenced by the controversy over then-President Donald Trump’s tweets and eventual removal from the service.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967382"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-37" href="#post-8599-footnote-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2019, a <em>New York Times </em>technology reporter systematically attempted to block and avoid the major tech platforms over a period of six weeks.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968079"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-38" href="#post-8599-footnote-38">[38]</a></sup> Even as a sophisticated user willing to switch software and hardware, she found it virtually impossible. Her conclusion: “After the experiment was over . . . I went back to using the companies’ services again, because as it demonstrated, I didn’t really have any other choice.”<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968085"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-39" href="#post-8599-footnote-39">[39]</a></sup> The major tech platforms have their tentacles into so many other services that even when we don’t think we are using them, we are. Facebook has profiles on many millions of people who have never used its service because their friends and relatives provide information that can be used to generate a “digital dossier.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-40" href="#post-8599-footnote-40">[40]</a></sup> Most smaller online services today delegate their login process to the giants, who already have the identification information and, it is hoped, the systems to maintain security.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-41" href="#post-8599-footnote-41">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are also technology firms whose significance is disproportionate to their scale. Consider the importance of Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zoom is, by most measures, no peer for the platform giants. It had approximately 4,400 employees at the start of 2021, and revenues of $2.65 billion.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95746469"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-42" href="#post-8599-footnote-42">[42]</a></sup> Founded in 2011, Zoom only went public in 2019.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-43" href="#post-8599-footnote-43">[43]</a></sup> Its video-conferencing software earned it a strong following in what was seen as a growing but still relatively niche market. However, when the pandemic forced many millions of workers and students to work from home starting in early 2020, Zoom usage took off.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-44" href="#post-8599-footnote-44">[44]</a></sup> Competing products such as Skype, Microsoft Teams, Blue Jeans, and Google Meet have seen huge take-up as well, but Zoom has been the market leader.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95746472"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-45" href="#post-8599-footnote-45">[45]</a></sup> It was remarkably effective at scaling up quickly to support massive levels of video traffic. It is difficult to imagine how most major businesses, universities, and K–12 schools could have functioned effectively without it during 2020–2021.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-46" href="#post-8599-footnote-46">[46]</a></sup> Even as firms and schools return to in-person operations, they are continuing to use Zoom for meetings that previously would have been conducted in person. Zoom, or something like it, has rapidly become an essential business tool like email or the Web.</p>
<p>The Zoom example highlights how there has been a critical shift behind the scenes over the past two decades regarding how technology firms operate. The cloud revolution has turned computing power into a utility. Starting with Amazon Web Services, major tech firms such as Google and Microsoft now provide computing, storage, and other functionality as services to other firms doing business online.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-47" href="#post-8599-footnote-47">[47]</a></sup> Even Apple, whose core businesses involve selling hardware and software, now operates massive data centers to handle photos, messaging, application delivery, music, and streaming video offerings.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-48" href="#post-8599-footnote-48">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cloud computing allows firms to purchase computing as a resource from a large, common pool, analogous to how they purchase electricity. That structure allows firms to quickly scale capacity up or down and provides better reliability through expert centralized management and global redundancy.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95666149"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-49" href="#post-8599-footnote-49">[49]</a></sup> Although software and hardware products almost inevitably have bugs or security vulnerabilities, users have come to expect always-available digital services. They think of Google or Facebook similarly to the way they think of heating, electricity, and water: as essential utilities.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-50" href="#post-8599-footnote-50">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The utility that operates the electricity distribution network in your city may not be one of the biggest firms in the country, but if the lights go off your life comes to a standstill. With so much of business and daily life dependent on the internet, the infrastructure underlying internet services takes on an outsized role.</p>

<p>When they first took off, the major tech platforms saw themselves—and were widely seen by others—as upstarts, challenging dominant incumbents with valuable innovations in operations and user benefits. That has changed, with widespread dissatisfaction growing over the firms and how they are regulated. As we will see, our proposal can address a serious gap in the regulatory environment now that these big firms have made something of a heel-turn. Microsoft and Apple rode the personal-computer revolution of the 1980s to supplant mighty IBM and other major technology or telecommunications firms of the day.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-51" href="#post-8599-footnote-51">[51]</a></sup> Google and Amazon launched with the internet revolution in the late 1990s, in part positioning themselves against Microsoft, which had become the most powerful company in technology. Facebook, and a host of smaller yet still huge companies, such as Netflix and Uber, came on the scene in the 2000s, as broadband and mobile connectivity set the stage for an era of “Web 2.0.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-52" href="#post-8599-footnote-52">[52]</a></sup> All these companies have strong entrepreneurial DNA, with visionary founders—Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sergei Brin, and Larry Page—who steered them from their days in garages.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-53" href="#post-8599-footnote-53">[53]</a></sup> That the internet became such a crucial fact of daily life and business, and that so many services did not charge up-front fees thanks to advertising or other business models, were viewed as triumphs.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-54" href="#post-8599-footnote-54">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Policymakers and regulators initially endorsed the rapid growth of Big Tech. In 1997, the Clinton Administration issued the <em>Framework for Global Electronic Commerce</em>, which firmly declared that government should avoid undue interference with the emerging internet ecosystem.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-55" href="#post-8599-footnote-55">[55]</a></sup> Legislation such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967398"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-56" href="#post-8599-footnote-56">[56]</a></sup> and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-57" href="#post-8599-footnote-57">[57]</a></sup> sought to shield digital platforms from unreasonable or unintended legal obligations. GAFAM were celebrated as great American success stories, with firms such as Alibaba, Didi, Baidu, and Tencent seen in similar lights in China.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-58" href="#post-8599-footnote-58">[58]</a></sup> If occasional academics criticized “the Googlization of ‘everything,’” they were swimming against the tide.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-59" href="#post-8599-footnote-59">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>All that changed rapidly in the late 2010s. Big Tech platforms became the targets of intense criticism on several fronts. The recent emergence of neo-Brandeisian antitrust theorists and activists, as well as the ongoing efforts of European competition regulators alarmed at the influence of these largely American platforms, have turned the debate toward the dangers of bigness.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95630177"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-60" href="#post-8599-footnote-60">[60]</a></sup> Their concern has resonated. The intrusive model of “surveillance capitalism” (to use Shoshana Zuboff’s evocative phrase) and the flaws of mass-scale, algorithmic decision-making have provoked increasing alarm among policymakers and the public.<a id="post-8599-_Ref121991800"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-61" href="#post-8599-footnote-61">[61]</a></sup> The role that social media firms played in the spread of misinformation during recent presidential elections and in other contexts raised alarms that technology was not just, as Google’s mission statement claimed, making information “universally accessible and useful,” but making us in some ways less informed and serving nefarious ends.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-62" href="#post-8599-footnote-62">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 2020, Big Tech was the target of intense attacks in scholarship,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-63" href="#post-8599-footnote-63">[63]</a></sup> books,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-64" href="#post-8599-footnote-64">[64]</a></sup> and documentaries.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-65" href="#post-8599-footnote-65">[65]</a></sup> CEOs of the major platforms were hauled before congressional committees to justify their actions, and regulators (especially in Europe) were regularly imposing large fines on them for privacy and competition policy violations.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-66" href="#post-8599-footnote-76">[76]</a></sup> Strikingly, these attacks were bipartisan, although the issues Democrats and Republicans highlighted often differed.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-8599-footnote-67">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>The intensity and prominence of the “techlash” might suggest that there is no need for further action because tech platforms will at some point be subject to sufficient regulatory oversight. However, this is not the case. There are significant unsolved problems and unresolved controversies in the current tech-regulation debates. Most important from our perspective, even if they are addressed, systemic risk will still be a serious blind spot.</p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582968"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91703754"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91683466"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531168"></a> 2. Shape of the Current Debates</h4>
<p>There are two reasons why current approaches to tech regulation do not appropriately respond to systemic risk: substantive focus and procedural frameworks.</p>
<p>First, the major issues of contention in contemporary policy debates over Big Tech do not relate to systemic harms. The most contemporary heat, if not light, in the debate about technology has come from concerns about speech on technology platforms. Liberals have focused their attention on the popularity of disinformation, often designed to activate conservatives, on sites like Facebook.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-8599-footnote-68">[68]</a></sup> These observers have worried about Russian interference via social media in American elections, have worried about the spread of falsehoods on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and have bemoaned the popularity of often misleading conservative commentary on current events.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-8599-footnote-69">[69]</a></sup> The right, on the other hand, has focused on different sorts of platform biases. Conservatives argue that the halting efforts by platforms to remove disinformation from their sites has systematically been biased against right-of-center commentators.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-8599-footnote-70">[70]</a></sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-70" href="#post-8599-footnote-70"></a> In their view, it is liberals who are engaged in speech suppression by seizing the levers of control on platforms and using that control to deplatform non-liberal speech.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967438"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-71">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>The result has been a form of gridlock, as policymakers have debated limitations or repeal of the so-called Section 230 grants of immunity to websites that permit comment from their users.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967428"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-72">[72]</a> </sup>Because it is hard to imagine how platforms would work without this sort of immunity, let alone whether holding companies liable for speech that others make on their platforms would be consistent with First Amendment principles, the policy solution to this question of privileged speech has been difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>These speech and informational controversies are extremely important. They are linked to the scale and influence of a small number of powerful platforms. Facebook and Twitter making decisions about what content to host or what messages to amplify is entirely different than a small online apparel company making the same kinds of decisions about product reviews on its site. The relevant harms, however, are political, relating to free speech and democracy. They raise the kinds of questions that have long been the subject of media and communications regulation, which were developed in response to earlier dominant information platforms in radio, telephony, and television.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-73">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second major area of tech policy controversy operates through an antitrust lens.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-74">[74]</a></sup> Politicians and policymakers have worried that Google, Facebook, and other platforms—but especially Google and Facebook—have become too big. Sometimes this bigness concern is articulated in a way that the early progressives emphasized with the first antitrust laws—a worry that, whatever the effect on the consumer, the problem with amassing so much information in a few platforms is simply unhealthy for the body politic.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-75">[75]</a></sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-75" href="#post-8599-footnote-75"></a> This model is associated with Justice Louis Brandeis’s concern that the concentration of economic power could lead to a despotic result in the political arena.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-76">[76]</a></sup><a id="post-8599-_Ref95630878"></a></p>
<p>The Brandeis critique is often thought to be a progressive one; in recent times, however, conservatives have found common ground with this argument. In particular, they believe that technology platforms are adopting practices that systematically disadvantage right-of-center perspectives.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95630577"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-77">[77]</a></sup> Non-progressives have thus also called for alternatives to the platforms. They believe that if there is no alternative to Facebook, there may be no room for different voices.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-78">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>In other words, the debate over whether firms have gotten too big to be healthy is rooted not just in fears about bigness in general but also in the belief it privileges the values held by the managers (or in some cases, the employees) of the biggest technology firms.</p>
<p>The American Innovation and Choice Online Act, designed to rein in anticompetitive practices of Big Tech, reached the Senate floor in 2022.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-79">[79]</a></sup> A bipartisan agreement on technology trustbusting is not impossible, but it is worth reflecting on the difficulty of winning the ensuing litigation. The government’s two highest profile cases against technology firms on monopolization grounds, the 1980s investigation of IBM and the 1990s Microsoft litigation, ultimately foundered. Breaking up companies through litigation is difficult to do, and the likelihood of victory in the courts is by no means certain.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-80">[80]</a></sup><a id="post-8599-_Ref111967506"></a></p>
<p>These competition policy concerns bear some similarity to systemic risk regulation, in that they involve identifying and targeting a subset of firms with sufficient scale, scope, or other market power. However, there is an important distinction from antitrust. The watchwords of systemic risk regulation are importance and resilience, rather than size and power. There have been significant antitrust actions in the sector, such as the Department of Justice blocking the proposed merger of Visa and Plaid,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8599-footnote-81">[81]</a>]</sup> but these are unconnected with systemic risk oversight. Market concentration is a factor in systemic risk—if there are many relatively small firms competing, it is unlikely the death of any of them would cause market-wide disruption.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-82">[82]</a></sup> However, whether economic power is too concentrated in a market is a different question from whether risk is. Otherwise, there would have been no need to establish a bespoke systemic risk regulation framework in the Dodd-Frank Act and other responses to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>A final major area of technology policy debate concerns privacy. The major tech platforms built their businesses around aggregation of tremendous amounts of data, including vast troves of personal information about virtually everyone. Privacy-related concerns animate the critiques of “surveillance capitalism,” the model under which tech platforms relentlessly target and then shape users’ interests to feed their advertising businesses.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-83">[83]</a></sup> The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018, imposes extensive requirements on all data processors and data controllers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-84">[84]</a></sup> While the United States still does not have a comprehensive federal data-protection law, several major states have passed laws incorporating aspects of GDPR, and there is strong legislative momentum in Congress for further action.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-85">[85]</a></sup> A compromise bill with the support of key House and Senate leaders was introduced in mid-2022.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-86">[86]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, however, privacy is different than systemic risk. Privacy rules focus on whether surveillance practices of tech platforms are harmful to users, not whether the failure of those platforms might be. It is true that the more data firms aggregate, the greater the dangers of data breaches. However, privacy regulation generally focuses on the harms of those breaches to customers of the relevant firm whose information is leaked, rather than the possibility of industry-wide contagion.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-87">[87]</a></sup></p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582969"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91703755"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc91683467"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531169"></a> 3. The Tech Regulation Playbook</h4>
<p>In addition to focusing on a limited set of issues, the current tech policy debates apply a restrictive set of tools.</p>
<p>The roots of technology regulation go back to the regimes for telecommunications and media firms, which were established earlier in the twentieth century.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-88">[88]</a></sup> Those, in turn, trace their roots to public-utility regulation created originally for railroads in the nineteenth century.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95720931"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-89">[89]</a></sup> The main pillars of public-utility regulation are common carriage, universal service, and price regulation.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968000"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-90">[90]</a></sup> The idea of both is that some industries are so foundational and subject to such strong natural monopoly conditions that market forces will not produce outcomes that meet essential public-policy objectives.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8599-footnote-91">[91]</a></sup> As a result, firms were required to provide services to all comers without discrimination and were subject to intrusive oversight of the prices they charged. Classic public-utility regulation has been significantly reduced in communications and media industries in favor of a managed-competition approach.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-92" href="#post-8599-footnote-92">[92]</a></sup> The contemporary derivative of those frameworks is network neutrality: the principle that internet platforms should not discriminate against unaffiliated traffic or devices.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95665939"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-93" href="#post-8599-footnote-93">[93]</a></sup> Essentially, the idea is that digital platforms should be open and fair for all who depend on them, rather than pure profit maximizers for proprietary wealth creation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-94" href="#post-8599-footnote-94">[94]</a></sup> Under this approach, regulation is typically conducted by a specialized expert agency, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-95" href="#post-8599-footnote-95">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>Much of the debate about Big Tech has concerned whether it should be something analogous to a network-neutrality framework,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-96" href="#post-8599-footnote-96">[96]</a></sup> and whether a new specialized regulatory agency should be created.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95721818"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-97" href="#post-8599-footnote-97">[97]</a></sup> Such an agency would focus on addressing practices by the tech platforms that reduce competition or harm users. Antitrust enforcement to block mergers and break up firms that have become too big or powerful would complement the regulatory oversight. While these are very important debates, they are also familiar ones. Similar questions about whether to create a new agency and whether to ramp up antitrust enforcement come to the fore every time market structures change in major industries.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-98" href="#post-8599-footnote-98">[98]</a></sup><a id="post-8599-_Ref111968013"></a></p>
<p>Whether such rules are desirable for Big Tech is beyond the scope of this Article. We take no position on whether further speech, antitrust, or privacy regulation should be imposed or what it might look like. Our focus is on a blind spot in the discussion. The standard regulatory playbook tends to ignore or poorly address a particular category of harms: those arising from systemic risk. As noted earlier, antitrust focuses on concentrated power, while expert agencies focus on industry practices or standards. Neither is well-suited to consider whether some market participants may create disproportionate risk, even if they fail to meet standard market-power tests or engage in otherwise-troublesome behavior. We thus turn to the question of whether systemic risk is a problem in today’s tech sector.</p>

<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582971"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531171"></a> 1. Defining Systemic Importance</h4>
<p>Not all risks are significant, and not all significant risks are systemic. There are many things that companies can do or fail to do, which cause harms to their customers and other stakeholders. The bigger the firm, the greater the magnitude of these risks. Regulation in its varied forms is designed to ameliorate risks not sufficiently addressed through market forces and private mechanisms. As noted in the previous section, the ongoing debates about Big Tech concern whether regulatory and competition policy obligations should be extended in new ways to major digital platforms. Those proposals, however, concern dangers involving the companies themselves, not their potential impact on the overall economic system.</p>
<p>Systemic risk does not have a precise definition.<a id="post-8599-_Ref123656008"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-99" href="#post-8599-footnote-99">[99]</a></sup> It is generally discussed in the context of financial regulation as the potential that a shock will cause cascading effects, resulting in the financial system as a whole seizing up such that capital is effectively unavailable.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-100" href="#post-8599-footnote-100">[100]</a></sup> The textbook example of systemic risk is a bank run, which occurred during the Great Depression: depositors lost faith in a large number of banks and accordingly attempted to withdraw their funds <em>en masse</em>, which is the sort of thing that banks—who loan out the money depositors give them—are definitionally not prepared for.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-101" href="#post-8599-footnote-101">[101]</a></sup> Similarly, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers and prospective failure of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, AIG, and other large institutions created a panic across the entire financial system.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-102" href="#post-8599-footnote-102">[102]</a></sup> A key aspect of systemic risk is this notion of contagion: Failures in one institution can spill over to others, even if <em>ex ante </em>they seemed sufficiently robust.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-103" href="#post-8599-footnote-103">[103]</a></sup></p>
<p>The need for a separate layer of regulation emerges, in part, from the fact that oversight of each individual firm cannot fully internalize the spillovers. The costs of bailing out Lehman Brothers in 2008 were deemed too high because they were weighed against the shareholder losses and other direct impacts of a Lehman bankruptcy, not the dramatically greater costs of the near-Depression that resulted. Firms of systemic importance are also the ones that tend to be “too big to fail”—knowledge of their significance produces moral-hazard dynamics in which gains are internalized but risks are socialized through government bailouts.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-104" href="#post-8599-footnote-104">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>The study of systemic risk in the financial sector and what to do about it blossomed after the Global Financial Crisis. There was, however, little discussion about how the concept might be relevant elsewhere in the economy.<a id="post-8599-_Ref91688673"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-105" href="#post-8599-footnote-105">[105]</a></sup> One reason for this is that concepts traditionally used to articulate systemic risk, such as cost of capital or asset volatility, are associated with finance. However, the characteristics of systemic risk in finance apply to a variety of scenarios. There is no reason these should necessarily be limited to financial markets. Such markets are necessarily interconnected because money is money; it is the representation of value, unit of account, and means of exchange across all firms and users. In an era of global digital networks and physical supply chains, however, finance may no longer be so exceptional. As a group of RAND researchers point out, the bailouts during the Global Financial Crisis included the major U.S. auto makers, even though they were not predominantly in the financial services sector, because of the ripple effects their failures would have had across interdependent supply chains.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-106" href="#post-8599-footnote-106">[106]</a></sup></p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582972"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531172"></a> 2. Systemic Risk Beyond Finance</h4>
<p>The RAND researchers were among the first to attempt to model systemic importance outside of the financial services sector. A major challenge for such an effort is that there is no single metric, such as capital, to evaluate firms in nonfinancial markets.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-107" href="#post-8599-footnote-107">[107]</a></sup> The fact that Apple holds tens of billions of dollars of cash on its balance sheet does not make it a risky enterprise; to the contrary, it makes Apple more resilient. This is because Apple is, predominantly, not a vehicle for others’ capital; those funds represent its own profits from sales of goods and services.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-108" href="#post-8599-footnote-108">[108]</a></sup> Similarly, it is not as obvious what a systemic failure would mean outside finance, where the freezing up of liquidity can be measured using the same kinds of financial metrics.</p>
<p>To address these difficulties, the RAND team developed a novel dataset of the interconnections among firms in the broader economy based on a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirement to disclose information about business segments and customers that represent more than 10% of consolidated sales or revenues.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-109" href="#post-8599-footnote-109">[109]</a></sup> This allowed them to construct a model of upstream and downstream dependencies. If a firm fails, the impacts will be felt by its suppliers and those it supplies. Failures of firms with more connections to other firms will have more systemic impacts. So will unexpected revenue shocks of such firms short of failure. The RAND study estimated the total economic loss of a 1% revenue shock to every firm based on this model. In this way, the RAND analysis models the equivalent of a bank run for cascading failures in other industries.</p>
<p>The firm that would generate the largest loss of a shock according to this model was not a bank. It was Amazon, at a $77 billion economic loss for just a 1% revenue shock.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-110" href="#post-8599-footnote-110">[110]</a></sup> Apple was sixth.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-111" href="#post-8599-footnote-111">[111]</a></sup> Even more interesting, when sorted in terms of the highest estimated losses per unit of revenue, the top firm was the internet domain name registrar GoDaddy.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-112" href="#post-8599-footnote-112">[112]</a></sup> The human-resources software firm Workday was also in the top twenty.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-113" href="#post-8599-footnote-113">[113]</a></sup> Neither would be remotely considered a Big Tech platform in the same category as Facebook, even though both are dominant in their particular market segment. A 1% shock to GoDaddy’s revenues would cause $4 billion in losses across the economy, the researchers projected, even though GoDaddy itself only generates $220 million in annual revenue.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-114" href="#post-8599-footnote-114">[114]</a></sup> This disproportionate importance of certain firms is consistent with the systemic risk model, where size is not everything.</p>
<p>The point of the RAND study was to demonstrate a methodology for investigating systemic risk in the broader economy and to suggest areas of concern.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-115" href="#post-8599-footnote-115">[115]</a></sup> The researchers did not attempt to identify comprehensively which firms posed systemic threats or why. The methodology of modeling firm-level interconnections and impacts of revenue shocks was expressly limited.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-116" href="#post-8599-footnote-116">[116]</a></sup> Nonetheless, it provides evidence for the intuition that financial services firms are not the only ones subject to contagion risk and that the sources of such risk may not only be the largest and most prominent firms. In finance, establishment of systemic risk as a major topic of public-policy concern stimulated academic research on how best to evaluate it. Greater attention to systemic risk in technology platforms, as we propose, should similarly help improve the tools available for the task.</p>
<p>As described earlier, the structure of the internet ecosystem as a collection of interconnected platforms, linked through APIs and utility-like infrastructure, creates conditions of dense interconnection.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-117" href="#post-8599-footnote-117">[117]</a></sup> Amazon sits at the nexus of a vast network of firms that create, market, and distribute virtually every product imaginable and an equally vast information network that tracks, analyzes, recommends, and finds those products. Moreover, because Amazon operates over the internet, it depends on largely privately controlled infrastructure to move data reliably across a distributed global data network with no central control point.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-118" href="#post-8599-footnote-118">[118]</a></sup> One piece of that infrastructure manages the domain names that allow users to find websites, millions of which were registered through GoDaddy.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-119" href="#post-8599-footnote-119">[119]</a></sup> There are other components of internet infrastructure whose importance is similarly obscure, such as content delivery networks like Akamai that facilitate streaming media and services such as Cloudflare that protect against paralyzing distributed denial-of-service attacks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-120" href="#post-8599-footnote-120">[120]</a></sup></p>
<p>We do not suggest that all such firms are systemically important. In Part II below, we describe the macroprudential regulatory framework developed in financial markets pursuant to Dodd-Frank and other responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Using that as a model, we develop a framework to evaluate whether a technology firm is systemically important. Our point here is that major technology firms (and some not even considered major) bear characteristics sufficiently similar to those that gave rise to systemic risk concerns in finance.</p>
<p>An important value of the systemic risk paradigm is its generality. It focuses not on the dangerous ways powerful firms may succeed, such as by manipulating markets or abusing their customers, but on the dangerous consequences of their failure. In contrast to most regulatory inquiries, which start from standards for problematic conduct and apply them to firms, this approach begins with standards for identifying firms, and only then looks at their conduct. Behavior that would be unobjectionable for most businesses can raise serious concerns for systemically important ones. Thus, even for existing policy considerations, such as cybersecurity breaches, the analysis may be quite different in the context of systemic importance.</p>
<p>In subpart I(D), we elaborate on the cybersecurity example and the danger of cloud service outages. However, these are far from the only scenarios in which systemic risk might come into play for technology platforms. Because systemically important firms are “too big to fail,” <em>any </em>major business disruption becomes an industry-wide or even economy-wide concern.</p>
<p>For example, ride-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber have become ubiquitous in cities. There is evidence that in addition to outcompeting private taxi services and reducing car purchases among some populations, these platforms significantly reduce usage and therefore undermine the financial sustainability of public transportation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-121" href="#post-8599-footnote-121">[121]</a></sup> Yet Uber and Lyft, despite their massive adoption and large public market valuations, have never been remotely close to profitability, and show little sign of reaching that goal in the near future.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-122" href="#post-8599-footnote-122">[122]</a></sup> A market downturn in which investors lost confidence and additional capital was not available might drive them into insolvency. That would, in turn, not only have consequences for their investors, employees, and drivers, but could remove a major form of mobility from cities. While other transportation options would eventually return to fill the gaps, there might be significant economic disruption for an extended period. These knock-on costs would be much greater than the direct losses to those directly involved with the ride-hailing firms.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing scenario might be fanciful. It rests on several claims about the scale of these services, their displacement of alternate forms of transportation, the plausibility of their failure, and the attendant disruption. These are all subject to empirical investigation. We do not assert here that Uber and Lyft are systemically important. We observe that they plausibly might be, or might become so. And if they were, the attendant risks are not adequately addressed in any of the current public-policy discussions around these firms.</p>
<p>One reason for systemic risk regulation is that, by the time such risks become real, it is too late to do anything short of the heroic (and fantastically costly) kinds of interventions that were necessary to end the Global Financial Crisis. Such risks must be considered prospectively. Developing the empirical and institutional machinery we propose in this Article not only helps to respond to the harms of systemic risk in technology, it will help to prevent them.</p>
<p>Systemically important firms also have a complex relationship with regulation and other governmental policy initiatives. On the one hand, they tend to be dominant and aggressive actors who appropriately attract the most intensive regulatory engagement. Often rules expressly limit their applicability to larger firms, who have the compliance resources that smaller firms lack.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-123" href="#post-8599-footnote-123">[123]</a></sup> Regulators in Europe have imposed the strictest data protection and platform-liability rules on the Big Tech platforms. In response, these platforms have at times suggested they might be forced to withdraw from jurisdictions where the rules are too onerous.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-124" href="#post-8599-footnote-124">[124]</a></sup> To the extent the services they provide are of systemic importance, doing so would be extremely damaging.</p>
<p>It may well be that the threats by platforms to shut down operations are just negotiating ploys. In other cases, however, governments may deliberately attempt to oust firms. China, in particular, has already blocked the major U.S.-based social networking and search platforms and created restrictions that made it untenable for them to operate local subsidiaries.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-125" href="#post-8599-footnote-125">[125]</a></sup> This occurred before such firms reached their current level of importance in the West, and Chinese alternatives have developed to serve the local market. However, Apple still has a huge presence in China, both as a primary manufacturing location and as one of its biggest and most profitable markets.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-126" href="#post-8599-footnote-126">[126]</a></sup> If China took steps to cut off supply chains or market access for Apple, the impacts could be severe and not at all limited to China.</p>
<p>These scenarios illustrate how systemic importance raises different issues than the current regulatory debates involving Big Tech. The possibility that essential firms will fail may seem remote. However, by definition, such “black swan” events appear so up to the moment when they occur, with disastrous consequences.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-127" href="#post-8599-footnote-127">[127]</a></sup> The possibility that collateralized mortgage obligations and credit default swaps would tank the global economy for a period of years seemed remote to most observers prior to 2008 as well.</p>
<p>An important basis for systemic risk regulation is that the effort and expense involved in building robustness into the system before it is needed tends to be far smaller than the costs when it would have made a difference. Moreover, the possibility that a relatively small technology firm with disproportionate importance, such as GoDaddy, would fail, is considerably easier to envision than one of the Big Tech giants. A systemic risk orientation is the only way to ensure that the outsized risks that the collapse of such firms might unleash are appropriately considered.</p>

<p>We are not the only observers to use the term “systemically important” in the context of major digital platforms, though we apply it in the way that Congress and financial regulators would find most familiar. However, earlier users of the term have generally focused on importance rather than the systemic dimension. They employ it primarily as a proxy for “large and should be further regulated.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-128" href="#post-8599-footnote-128">[128]</a></sup> Systemic risk is used anecdotally in prior work, rather than based on empirical factors. Prior researchers have therefore not developed the regulatory framework we introduce later in this Article.</p>
<p>For example, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) suggested in 2020 that a council of regulators “should evaluate the reach and impact of social media companies, as well as the society-wide consequences of social media platform[] misuse, to determine which companies they should designate as systemically important.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-129" href="#post-8599-footnote-129">[129]</a></sup> This suggestion arose when it found that Twitter was not sufficiently protected against a hack, and high-profile accounts were seized for a cryptocurrency scam.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-130" href="#post-8599-footnote-130">[130]</a></sup> “The risks posed by social media to our consumers, economy, and democracy are no less grave than the risks posed by large financial institutions,” NYDFS observed.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-131" href="#post-8599-footnote-131">[131]</a></sup> As accurate as this assessment might be, NYDFS had limited authority to address it as a state regulatory agency, and no action was taken based on its recommendation.</p>
<p>Twitter is certainly now significant to the flow of important forms of speech such as news and political commentary, and a major channel for spreading harmful or fraudulent material. That does not make it systemically important. As discussed earlier, there have been several proposals to create a digital platform agency which would regulate major tech platforms the way the FCC today regulates media and telecommunications utilities.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-132" href="#post-8599-footnote-132">[132]</a></sup> Such an agency would be analogous to the macroprudential regulators in financial services, which exercise oversight on firms’ policies and practices to achieve defined public-policy objectives.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-133" href="#post-8599-footnote-133">[133]</a></sup> However, that is different from the macroprudential orientation of true systemic risk regulation, which concentrates on dangers to the economy as whole.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-134" href="#post-8599-footnote-134">[134]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, the World Economic Forum issued a report in 2017 that addressed what it termed “systemically important techs.”<a id="post-8599-_Ref123664414"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-135" href="#post-8599-footnote-135">[135]</a></sup> However, it used the phrase in a different sense. The report concentrated on the ways that finance and technology are increasingly intertwined. “Financial institutions increasingly resemble, and are dependent on, large tech firms to acquire critical infrastructure and differentiating technologies,” as Marc Hochstein explained in a review of the report.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-136" href="#post-8599-footnote-136">[136]</a></sup> In other words, the emphasis was on how tech is important to finance, not on how the systemic risk framework developed for financial services might be a model for tech. The proposal was more a thought bubble than a mandate—one of the authors of the report characterized the use of the term “systemically important” as “a play on words, intentionally so.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-137" href="#post-8599-footnote-137">[137]</a></sup></p>
<p>Financial institutions and technology firms are indeed becoming increasingly inseparable, which has led some policymakers to propose subjecting technology firms to financial oversight.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-138" href="#post-8599-footnote-138">[138]</a></sup> The idea is that as financial firms increasingly move their services into the cloud, they are at risk of tech sector disruption; regulators “fear a glitch at one cloud company could bring down key services across multiple banks and countries, leaving customers unable to make payments or access services, and undermine confidence in the financial system.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-139" href="#post-8599-footnote-139">[139]</a></sup> We view these approaches as broad illustrations of the parallels between the two industries and the way the government engages with them. They provide support for considering technology firms more explicitly within the realm of financial regulation. Our aim is different: using the tools of financial regulation to develop a new way to think about technology regulation.</p>
<p>One reason to worry about simply having financial regulators oversee tech firms is that it might look like an impermissible overreach by regulators who have not been given these responsibilities. The Supreme Court has of late taken a skeptical view of expansive approaches to the regulatory frontiers of agencies. During the pandemic, it struck down an effort by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to mandate vaccinations for employees of larger employers on the grounds that Congress had not clearly authorized this sort of public-health intervention.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-140" href="#post-8599-footnote-140">[140]</a></sup> It also reversed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s effort to ban evictions on the theory that they could lead to a spread of the virus.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-141" href="#post-8599-footnote-141">[141]</a></sup> Even where permissible, agency mission creep should be treated skeptically as a policy matter. Are regulators used to dealing with banks and trading firms best situated to understand social media platforms and domain name registrars?</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly the case that technology firms are increasingly intertwined with the financial services ecosystem. And this creates under-appreciated risks. For example, in 2019, Capital One leaked customer data for 106 million people, including information about card balances, credit scores, and even in some cases Social Security numbers and linked bank account numbers.<a id="post-8599-_Ref123665036"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-142" href="#post-8599-footnote-142">[142]</a></sup> It turned out that a former employee of Amazon Web Services—which supplied Capital One with cloud data services—had accessed the personal information.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-143" href="#post-8599-footnote-143">[143]</a></sup> She was charged with computer fraud and abuse;<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-144" href="#post-8599-footnote-144">[144]</a></sup> but the incident also led two legislators to ask the Treasury Secretary to designate cloud providers, including Amazon, as systemically important “financial market utilities.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-145" href="#post-8599-footnote-145">[145]</a></sup> Doing so would subject such utilities to additional regulation by a federal regulator, most typically the Federal Reserve (the Fed).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-146" href="#post-8599-footnote-146">[146]</a></sup> The Treasury declined this invitation, and Capital One later agreed to pay a $190 million settlement over the data breach.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-147" href="#post-8599-footnote-147">[147]</a></sup> This incident illustrates how, even when tech platforms’ roles in financial market risk are identified, there is no developed language for evaluating responses. That is one element of what we hope to provide by building out a framework for systemic risk regulation for tech.</p>
<p>Thus, while the term is in circulation, prior articles have not attempted to build out a model for understanding tech platforms as systemically important in the sense understood by financial regulation. Nor has there been a careful attempt to design a regulatory regime appropriate for the industry context. If anything, the way “systemically important” is thrown around casually outside of finance reinforces the importance of our project.</p>
<p>Before developing our regulatory framework, we next examine in more detail what systemic resilience for technology platforms means. In the previous subpart, we described a few hypothetical scenarios in which critical technology firms failed.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111967276"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-148" href="#post-8599-footnote-148">[148]</a></sup> There, we deliberately selected unusual possibilities to emphasize the broad nature of systemic risks. To further reinforce the need for attention to systemically important technology firms, we offer here two more extensive case studies of more likely scenarios.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531174"></a> D. <a id="post-8599-_Toc95582974"></a>Case Studies</h3>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582975"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531175"></a> 1. Cybersecurity Breaches</h4>
<p>As discussed in section I(B)(2), cybersecurity breaches are a pervasive and growing threat. Data breach notifications or even the largest imaginable fines would not remotely address the harms of a major breach by an essential platform. Steps must be taken to reinforce the robustness of the data-protection environment overall, such that systemic breaches are both less common and less dangerous.</p>
<p>Data breaches illustrate how systemic risks of Big Tech go beyond the existing regulatory debates. Virtually all companies store the information of their customers digitally, including sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers and credit card numbers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-149" href="#post-8599-footnote-149">[149]</a></sup> If it falls into the wrong hands, this information can lead to identity theft, unauthorized charges, and the invasion of personal privacy, with consequences including ransoms or worse. As the world becomes increasingly digitalized, data breaches also become more frequent, impose more risks, and cause more serious damages to society. Data-breach-notification requirements have been adopted in most states, GDPR, and all major proposals for federal privacy legislation.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968040"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-150" href="#post-8599-footnote-150">[150]</a></sup></p>
<p>Data breaches are normally viewed as a privacy or data-protection issue, relevant to any firm that holds or processes personal information. Many of the most damaging breaches did not even involve “technology” firms. For example, the hotel giant Marriott suffered two major data breaches within sixteen months. The 2018 breach impacted more than 327 million Starwood guests (Starwood was purchased by Marriott).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-151" href="#post-8599-footnote-151">[151]</a></sup> And about 5.2 million members of the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program had their personal information stolen in 2020.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-152" href="#post-8599-footnote-152">[152]</a></sup> The Choice Hotels chain, whose brands include Quality Inn and Cambria Hotels, also lost control of sensitive customer data in 2019.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-153" href="#post-8599-footnote-153">[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such data breaches cause serious harms and have led to significant penalties. For example, Marriott was fined £18.4 million by the British Information Commission’s Office (ICO) because of its 2018 data breach.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-154" href="#post-8599-footnote-154">[154]</a></sup> After it was hacked in 2017, the credit bureau Equifax paid at least $575 million, and potentially up to $700 million, settling with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and fifty U.S. states and territories for its “failure to take reasonable steps to secure its network.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-155" href="#post-8599-footnote-155">[155]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are, by definition, spillover effects of data breaches, in that information harvested from one location can be used elsewhere. Stolen passwords may be used to access another site, or personal information may be used for identity theft. However, these risks are generally not systemic—they rely on a form of interconnection but are not contagious. Many firms may have the same vulnerabilities because they use the same software. A data breach at one firm, however, is not likely to produce a cascading effect elsewhere. Even the Equifax breach did not undermine the security of the other two major credit bureaus.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-156" href="#post-8599-footnote-156">[156]</a></sup> Tools such as data-breach-notification laws and enforcement actions by privacy or consumer-protection regulators are appropriate means to address most data-breach risks, even if not completely effective.</p>
<p>There may, however, be firms whose role in data protection does rise to the level of systemic risk. This could be either because of their size or their importance to data security. A 2014 data breach at Yahoo! impacted roughly half a billion user accounts, much more than even the notorious Equifax breach.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-157" href="#post-8599-footnote-157">[157]</a></sup> And Yahoo! was by then an also-ran in the digital platform wars.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-158" href="#post-8599-footnote-158">[158]</a></sup></p>
<p>The GAFAM companies have, for the most part, avoided major data breaches, although they have been far from perfect when it comes to cybersecurity. If they did ever have a serious breach, however, the impact would be massive. These companies not only serve hundreds of millions or more customers; they provide, as noted earlier, the login functionality for many other sites online. And they are at the nexus of huge data-sharing networks with inconceivable amounts of personal information feeding their targeting and customization algorithms. A major data breach today by Facebook, Google, or Amazon would be catastrophic. It is to those companies’ credit that such an Armageddon has not occurred. They are highly motivated to prevent it and possess powerful tools for doing so. It must be recognized, however, that the degree of risk involved is orders of magnitude greater than the degree of risk for other private actors and even major government data repositories.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors in the systemic risk of tech platforms is the rise of cloud computing. The shift from treating the servers that deliver content over the internet as specialized devices operated by individual companies to vast pools of computing capacity managed and provisioned as infrastructure is in many ways as important as the shift from private networks to the interconnected global internet.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-159" href="#post-8599-footnote-159">[159]</a></sup> Cloud computing makes it possible to deliver powerful services to users around the world, with capacity scaling up or down based on demand.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-160" href="#post-8599-footnote-160">[160]</a></sup> Few of the now commonplace online services that billions of people take advantage of today would be viable without the power of cloud infrastructure.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-161" href="#post-8599-footnote-161">[161]</a></sup> Yet the flip side of this power is the extent to which the entire internet ecosystem, and everything connected to it, now depends on data centers managed by a handful of firms. As the authors of the RAND study of systemic risk in the broader economy explain:</p>
<p>No firm epitomizes the shift in systemic risk more than Amazon and its increasingly widespread cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a point illustrated through the efforts of this report. Amazon’s centrality in traditional production networks was just emerging at the time of the 2008 crisis. Now, its centrality in digital networks underpinning diverse firms and even public institutions provides an example of the potential of systemic risk in the broad economy, an example that calls for further study on potential risks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-162" href="#post-8599-footnote-162">[162]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Forbes has observed, “Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in the cloud computing . . . world with a market share of 32% in Q3 in 2020. . . . This means that any outage at Amazon can have a cascading impact on large swathes of the internet.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-163" href="#post-8599-footnote-163">[163]</a></sup> AWS experienced at least three outages in December 2021 alone, with attendant consequences for the businesses that rely on Amazon’s servers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-164" href="#post-8599-footnote-164">[164]</a></sup> For example, in an outage that largely affected northern Virginia, failure of AWS brought down sites including Adobe Spark, the <em>Capital Gazette</em>, Coinbase, the<em> Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, the<em> Washington Post</em>, and Roku, among others.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-165" href="#post-8599-footnote-165">[165]</a></sup> The New York City Subway also blamed the outage for challenges communicating with riders about service disruptions.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-166" href="#post-8599-footnote-166">[166]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nor are other countries immune from such problems. In September 2021, an AWS outage in Japan caused significant disruptions to “major online brokerages, a leading mobile phone carrier[,] and the country’s biggest airline.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-167" href="#post-8599-footnote-167">[167]</a></sup> Flights were delayed as the ticketing and check-in system of ANA Holdings went down.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-168" href="#post-8599-footnote-168">[168]</a></sup> Brokerages like SBI Securities and Rakuten Securities also reported delays in their price data feeds.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-169" href="#post-8599-footnote-169">[169]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nor is AWS the only cloud computing service to experience outages with rippling effects on its customers. In June 2021, several major sites in Australia stopped working for about an hour, and this outage was largely attributed to a glitch caused by service disruptions at Akamai, a U.S. service provider.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-170" href="#post-8599-footnote-170">[170]</a></sup> This outage affected Australian banks, Virgin Australia, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-171" href="#post-8599-footnote-171">[171]</a></sup> Some Australians “complained on social media of being stuck in supermarket checkouts with no way to pay for groceries or being stranded at gas stations and unable to pay for fuel.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-172" href="#post-8599-footnote-172">[172]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fastly, a cloud computing service that serves as an edge cloud platform, went down in early June 2021, and in so doing took down all sites that use the gov.uk domain, thereby preventing people from booking COVID-19 tests and from filing annual tax returns with HM Revenue and Customs.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-173" href="#post-8599-footnote-173">[173]</a></sup> The outage impacted businesses as well, including Amazon, Boots, and eBay, which were estimated to have lost millions of pounds in revenue as a result of the outage.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-174" href="#post-8599-footnote-174">[174]</a></sup></p>
<p>A Google Cloud outage in December 2020 brought down Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Docs, and Google Drive for about an hour, along with all services that rely on Google’s servers, including Pokémon Go and Discord.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-175" href="#post-8599-footnote-175">[175]</a></sup> Though the outage itself only lasted an hour, a large proportion of Gmail users dealt with continuing issues for about three hours after the outage.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-176" href="#post-8599-footnote-176">[176]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cloud computing increasingly occupies a central place in our technology infrastructure, and its leading providers have dropped significantly during the past five years. The number of companies using infrastructure as a service (IaaS), a type of cloud computing service,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-177" href="#post-8599-footnote-177">[177]</a></sup> has surged.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-178" href="#post-8599-footnote-178">[178]</a></sup> The COVID-19 pandemic, which pushed virtually all countries to implement work-from-home policies, has accelerated these developments.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-179" href="#post-8599-footnote-179">[179]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cloud computing is also capital-intensive and subject to significant economies of scale, leading to a concentrated market. The fifteen largest cloud service providers share more than 70% of the market.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-180" href="#post-8599-footnote-180">[180]</a></sup> In 2019, the Financial Stability Board, an international body of bank supervisors, had expressed its concerns about the concentration of risk in the space.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-181" href="#post-8599-footnote-181">[181]</a></sup></p>
<p>The disruption caused by even minor AWS outages gives an indication of how important cloud platforms have become and how widely their failures are felt. However, these services are generally not subject to specialized economic regulation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-182" href="#post-8599-footnote-182">[182]</a></sup> The terms of their interactions with customers are governed by contract, often including disclaimers that absolve the cloud providers from liability for technical failures.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-183" href="#post-8599-footnote-183">[183]</a></sup> There is reason to worry that private ordering will not fully address important risks, especially the systemic ones extending beyond individual firms.</p>
<h2><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582977"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531177"></a> II. The SIFI Model from Financial Regulation</h2>
<p>Financial regulation is different from other kinds of regulation in purpose and in style, partly because it emphasizes resilience and worries about interconnectedness. After reforms in the wake of the last financial crisis, the systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) model has passed a test during the pandemic with flying colors, a test that suggests to us that it offers an effective approach to resilience regulation. The more general alternative, Administrative Procedure Act (APA)-style administrative law, was devised in reference to adversarial relationships between a regulated industry and the agency that regulates it.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-184" href="#post-8599-footnote-184">[184]</a></sup> The APA sets forth the rules of the road that agencies must use to make policy and affords industry and other interests a route to court if the agency fails to follow those rules.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-185" href="#post-8599-footnote-185">[185]</a></sup> With environmental protection, or workplace safety, the paradigm is distributive rather than integrative. Costs not borne by the public are passed on to regulated industry, meaning that administrative law undergirds a contest in which judges are referees adjudicating the rationality and scientific soundness, or at least the process of identifying the scientific soundness, of government decisions to impose costs on businesses.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-186" href="#post-8599-footnote-186">[186]</a></sup></p>
<p>Financial regulation has adopted a different approach. It is collaborative, to some degree, because the provision of financial services is something like a public good. The private firms that extend credit and safeguard deposits are performing a service that the government <em>wants</em> to have performed, and so part of what the government does when it regulates finance is to encourage the development and reach of financial institutions.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95744837"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-187" href="#post-8599-footnote-187">[187]</a></sup> One of the functions of the Federal Reserve, for example, is to provide information to financial institutions through its research arm. It also provides institutions who run out of money, but are not insolvent, with loans. And it has longstanding relationships with its “primary dealers,” who stand ready to sell or buy government securities from the Federal Reserve when it wants to expand or contract the money supply.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-188" href="#post-8599-footnote-188">[188]</a></sup></p>
<p>When times turn bad, the financial system has proven itself to be highly susceptible to panics and collapse, which can impose more costs on the public than the firms themselves experience. The government accordingly has imposed rules on financial institutions designed to reduce the likelihood of collapse—rules that have been adjusted to now encompass the systemic-importance approach in place today. This aspect of financial regulation is not entirely collaborative—banks might prefer somewhat less resilience regulation—but it is not entirely adversarial, either. Investors, employees, and managers in financial firms worry about the risk of a collapse, either at their firm, or at an interconnected firm on which they rely (or even simply resemble), and take comfort from the government’s efforts to prevent a collapse.</p>
<p>Both regulators and the regulated, in other words, have an incentive to work together to create a system of financial regulation strong enough to weather shocks and healthy enough to encourage the public to make use of financial firms with confidence.<a id="post-8599-_Ref95745336"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-189" href="#post-8599-footnote-189">[189]</a></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, financial regulation offers a different kind of regulatory paradigm than the paradigms wielded over the more traditional industries regulated by other administrative agencies, but shared by the administrative context of other areas of the state seeking to provide services through a public–private partnership.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-190" href="#post-8599-footnote-190">[190]</a></sup> It is an old paradigm, too, though it has evolved over the years. Financial markets were among the earliest to be subjected to direct government involvement, as exemplified by the First and Second Banks of the United States and the creation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency during the Civil War. The nineteenth-century successes and failures of government efforts to encourage and rationalize the provision of financial services then have informed the way financial regulation works today.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-191" href="#post-8599-footnote-191">[191]</a></sup></p>
<p>The resiliency paradigm of finance has not yet been applied to the technology industry.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-192" href="#post-8599-footnote-192">[192]</a></sup> By contrast, the tech sector emphasizes the importance of innovation under a Schumpeterian paradigm in which that innovation is sometimes disruptive.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-193" href="#post-8599-footnote-193">[193]</a></sup> That innovation has costs, both to incumbent firms and to users, is taken as a necessary fact of life. We do not want to curb tech sector innovation but think that it could be paired with resilience regulation of the too-important-to-fail parts of the now elaborate ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the rest of this Part, we sketch out the fundamental principles of the systemic risk regulation paradigm. In the following Part, we apply that paradigm to areas of the tech industry that might most benefit from it.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582978"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531178"></a> A. Some Principles of Financial Regulation</h3>
<p>Financial regulation is all about building sustainable institutions. At both the global and domestic level, regulation can be characterized as pursuing three different ends in order to do so: an analysis of credit risk, operational risk, and market discipline.</p>
<p>First, regulators carefully scrutinize the credit risk taken on by financial institutions; for this, daily supervision of the balance sheet is traditional.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-194" href="#post-8599-footnote-194">[194]</a></sup> Indeed, financial regulators for many years only looked to credit risk—the risk that a bank was making loans that were unlikely to be repaid in full, resulting in losses that could be visited on the people providing the financing to make those loans (classically, individual depositors).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-195" href="#post-8599-footnote-195">[195]</a></sup> Since then, global regulators have identified two other sources of concern and opportunity when it comes to pursuing financial stability: market discipline for financial institutions and operational risk as a worry that can be paired with credit risk.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-196" href="#post-8599-footnote-196">[196]</a></sup> The opportunities afforded by market discipline—the idea is that investors can help regulators identify risky practices by voting with their feet and exiting risky firms—means that there is a role for disclosure by banks that allow investors to make intelligent choices about which banks to support.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-197" href="#post-8599-footnote-197">[197]</a></sup> As for the perils posed by operational risk, the idea is that banks can run into trouble not only by making bad investments, but also by misapplying their internal controls and allowing a rogue trader to put them into positions that can threaten the soundness of the bank.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-198" href="#post-8599-footnote-198">[198]</a></sup> Financial regulators have encouraged banks to develop controls to mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>Systemic risk regulation is a relatively new addition to the financial regulatory regime. It is based on the recognition that safety and soundness requirements that are appropriate for most firms may not be sufficient for those that are systemically important. Therefore, the first distinguishing feature of this regulatory framework is designation. Regulators identify certain firms, whose failure would imperil the rest of the financial markets, as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-199" href="#post-8599-footnote-199">[199]</a></sup> These firms are subject to heightened regulatory obligations to ensure their resiliency. Designation, moreover, is not limited to banks—the market segment traditionally subject to the most stringent oversight—but can and has been extended to systemically important nonbanks like insurance companies. There is both a domestic and international component of the SIFI designation process, in that American regulators identify American institutions whose failure would threaten the American economy and then work with their foreign counterparts to identify firms whose failure would likely spread across borders.</p>
<p>The international designation process is essentially an adjudication on a transnational level, with detailed metrics and applications of those metrics to individual banks, resulting in the designation of thirty banks—eight of which are American—as systemically important and therefore subject to extra oversight.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-200" href="#post-8599-footnote-200">[200]</a></sup> The domestic process of designation has operated in parallel with the international version, with the Financial Stability Oversight Council designating those American banks identified as systemically significant.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-201" href="#post-8599-footnote-201">[201]</a></sup> Designation costs large financial institutions. It subjects them to extra capital requirements, and in the United States it means additional supervision by the Federal Reserve.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-202" href="#post-8599-footnote-202">[202]</a></sup> However, these costs are meant to be exceeded by the benefits the rest of us receive when banks do not fail.</p>
<p>Nor are these the only economic consequences posed by SIFI designation. Although designation carries clear regulatory costs, it also raises the possibility of the receipt of a regulatory benefit—an implicit acknowledgment that the government will rescue a systemically important firm that gets into trouble. This could encourage investors to be willing to finance the firms cheaply, as they know their money will be safe there. As we will see, it is unlikely that a technology firm would enjoy a similar benefit—there are no government bailouts that would save a firm that suffers a tech disaster—but it is an issue that regulators must keep in mind.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582979"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531179"></a> B. The Financial Stability Oversight Council</h3>
<p>Domestically, the designation process is overseen by an organization of regulators chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury: the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Global Financial Crisis came as a surprise to financial regulators and resulted in a reorganization of regulatory oversight in an effort to better coordinate it and to create a robust process for the identification and designation of systemically important firms. During the crisis, the collapse of the housing market and the threat to banks posed by complex derivatives proved to be risks that neither the banks nor the regulators had foreseen adequately; the post-crisis reform was partly an effort to make sure that these sorts of surprises did not happen again.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-203" href="#post-8599-footnote-203">[203]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council is charged with taking a broader view of risks to financial stability in the hopes that idiosyncratic but real threats to financial institutions can be identified as early as possible.</p>
<p>As a result, Congress reformed the process of financial regulation through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-204" href="#post-8599-footnote-204">[204]</a></sup> In addition to strengthening the capital requirements of banks in an effort to make them more resilient to a surprising shock like those presented during the crisis, the statute created the process of identifying the particularly important financial institutions whose instability might threaten the system.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-205" href="#post-8599-footnote-205">[205]</a></sup></p>
<p>Comprised of representatives from various federal agencies, the Council should be understood as a regulator made up of regulators.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-206" href="#post-8599-footnote-206">[206]</a></sup> The Council is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and includes nine other federal financial regulators.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-207" href="#post-8599-footnote-207">[207]</a></sup> It also includes, in a nonvoting capacity, some non-federal regulators—a state banking regulator, a state insurance commissioner, and a state securities commissioner, as chosen by the state regulators in each issue area.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-208" href="#post-8599-footnote-208">[208]</a></sup> While this state–federal cooperative approach is relatively unique, the ability of states to affect decision-making on the council is limited. Only federal regulators, for example, get to vote on designations of systemic importance of nonbanks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-209" href="#post-8599-footnote-209">[209]</a></sup></p>
<p>Congress gave the Council eleven factors to apply to designations, with one including “any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate,” affording it a great deal of flexibility in determining what matters in designation.<a id="post-8599-_Ref113448625"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-210" href="#post-8599-footnote-210">[210]</a></sup> The Council, in turn, added content to that broad mandate by promulgating a regulation indicating that it would principally focus on size, substitutability, interconnectedness, leverage, liquidity, and existing regulatory scrutiny.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-211" href="#post-8599-footnote-211">[211]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council issued guidance dividing the six categories imposed by Dodd-Frank into two distinct groups.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-212" href="#post-8599-footnote-212">[212]</a></sup> The first group, including size, substitutability, and interconnectedness, was meant to “assess the potential impact of the nonbank financial company’s financial distress on the broader economy.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-213" href="#post-8599-footnote-213">[213]</a></sup> The second group, including leverage, liquidity risk, and maturity mismatch, would tell the Council “the vulnerability of a nonbank financial company to financial distress.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-214" href="#post-8599-footnote-214">[214]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interconnectedness is meant to capture direct or indirect linkages between financial companies that could transmit consequences to a broad swath of firms if a company found itself in material financial distress.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-215" href="#post-8599-footnote-215">[215]</a></sup> Relevant to this inquiry was not just the number of links to other firms—though firms that found themselves central to huge networks were certainly liable to be found to be systemically interconnected—but also the importance of the firm to its counterparties.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-216" href="#post-8599-footnote-216">[216]</a></sup> For example, a firm with a number of concentrated principal contractual counterparties might suggest a dangerous degree of interconnection by a financial firm, especially if the interlinked firms were large or unique in some way. An example might be a custodian, a firm that held assets for other firms; if the custodian fell into material financial distress, the firms that depended on the custodian to provide them with the collateral they had left with it could be seriously affected.</p>
<p>Substitutability is meant to identify the alternatives to a firm that finds itself in distress and withdraws from a particular market.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-217" href="#post-8599-footnote-217">[217]</a></sup> For example, a company with a stable and large market share compared to its competitors might impose high switching costs upon its parties if it fell into distress. The idea would be that the firm would have a stable base of clients who depend on it and would find it difficult to switch to an alternative service provider. The stability of that client base would be an example of the lack of substitutes. A classic example of a non-substitutable firm might be a regulated natural monopoly, like an electric company. If the company went under, its customers would find it difficult to switch to an alternative provider.</p>
<p>Size was conventionally measured by the balance sheet of a financial firm.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-218" href="#post-8599-footnote-218">[218]</a></sup> Balance sheets of such firms account for the assets, liabilities, and equity of the firm, and its related businesses. The idea is straightforward enough. Regulators worry much more about Wells Fargo collapsing than they do a small hometown bank because the small hometown bank’s collapse would only have a local effect, whereas Wells Fargo’s collapse would have national consequences. For what it is worth, regulators are not only interested in the big firm but also its related parties to make sure that the firm was not pretending to be small by disguising itself within a holding company structure with a number of affiliates. FSOC declared that it would assess size with reference, even, to off-balance-sheet entities that, if distressed, might impel the firm to do an unrequired rescue.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-219" href="#post-8599-footnote-219">[219]</a></sup> If the rescue then drew the rescuing parents of the off-balance-sheet entity into distress, regulators promised to take steps to ameliorate that issue.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-220" href="#post-8599-footnote-220">[220]</a></sup></p>
<p>Applying the metrics of size, substitutability, and interconnectedness was meant to give the Council a handle on the risks posed by the firm to the broader economy. The other three factors—leverage, liquidity risk, and maturity mismatch—were designed to help the Council assess the vulnerability of any particular firm.</p>
<p>Leverage is a somewhat uniquely financial term that is meant to capture a company’s exposure relative to the amount of its equity capital, which serves as a buffer to soak up losses. Under the capital rules applicable to banks, those institutions can be highly levered indeed. A leverage ratio of 3% is the minimum required by bank regulators across the world, although some countries require slightly more leverage.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-221" href="#post-8599-footnote-221">[221]</a></sup> The idea is straightforward enough. Consider two highly leveraged companies. If the first company buys one dollar of assets and finances the purchase by putting up two cents of its own money and borrowing $0.98 from somebody else, it has a leverage ratio of 2/100, or 2%. It will be insolvent if the asset it buys declines in value by more than two cents. Not only will the company have none of its money left, but its creditors will also face losses. If the second company engages in the same purchase, but puts up four cents of its own money, and borrows $0.96 from somebody else, it will remain solvent as long as its assets do not decline in value by more than four cents. The 4% leveraged company is less vulnerable to a decline in the value of its assets than is the 2% leveraged company.</p>
<p>Liquidity risk refers to the risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs. An example might be seen in the mortgage bank at the center of <em>It’s a Wonderful Life</em>.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-222" href="#post-8599-footnote-222">[222]</a></sup> After many of its depositors came in person to the bank seeking their deposits back immediately, George Bailey found it difficult to satisfy them all with the money he had on hand, as much of the money they deposited with the bank was tied up in houses that could not be turned easily into money. The bank owned plenty of assets but could not easily exchange those assets for the cash it needed to meet the demand for withdrawals.</p>
<p>Maturity mismatch refers to the difference between the maturities of the firm’s assets and its liabilities<a id="post-8599-_Ref113448643"></a>.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-223" href="#post-8599-footnote-223">[223]</a></sup> The term is related to liquidity risk, in that it also would be implicated if a company relied on short-term financing to fund long-term positions, like, say, depositors who can ask for their money back at any time funding home mortgages that will not be paid off for thirty years. Companies with a high degree of maturity mismatch are at risk of insolvency if that short-term financing disappears, which might force them to sell the mortgages, at fire-sale prices, in a desperate effort to raise ready cash.</p>
<p>In the course of designating four nonbanks as systemically important, the six factors were applied through a three-step process.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-224" href="#post-8599-footnote-224">[224]</a></sup> The first inquiry was quantitative and oriented on size. Nonbank financial companies with more than $50 billion in assets passed this stage and accordingly knew that they might be subject to designation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-225" href="#post-8599-footnote-225">[225]</a></sup> In the next stage, the Council would assess the riskiness of particular institutions that pass the quantitative threshold on its own, without informing the financial company of this process, making it an inquisitorial, rather than adversarial round in designation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-226" href="#post-8599-footnote-226">[226]</a></sup> Finally, if the first two stages of the process were met, the Council would invite the institution proposed for designation to present evidence to the Council designed to persuade it not to designate, a process that could involve lengthy hearings and the production of a great deal of evidence.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-227" href="#post-8599-footnote-227">[227]</a></sup> For example, when faced with designation, MetLife, a large insurance company, submitted over 21,000 pages of materials to the Council in an effort to stop the process at stage three.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-228" href="#post-8599-footnote-228">[228]</a></sup> (It did not work—the Council, by a vote of 9–1, with the federal insurance expert dissenting, ultimately designated MetLife as systemically important.)<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-229" href="#post-8599-footnote-229">[229]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for how to choose which financial firms to regulate, the Council took a three-part approach. It applied basic quantitative criteria to banks—big banks were designated as systemically significant and directed to submit to additional regulation by the Fed and to hold additional capital.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-230" href="#post-8599-footnote-230">[230]</a></sup> Financial market utilities—the exchanges and trade processing institutions that undergirded the markets—were also subjected to regulation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-231" href="#post-8599-footnote-231">[231]</a></sup> These “systems that provide the essential infrastructure for transferring, clearing, and settling payments, securities, and other financial transactions among financial institutions or between financial institutions and the system,”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-232" href="#post-8599-footnote-232">[232]</a></sup> as the Fed put it, would have enhanced supervision by the Fed, the SEC, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-233" href="#post-8599-footnote-233">[233]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the Council was particularly interested in making sure that there were no nonbanks who posed risks like banks did but were not regulated as carefully as banks were. The Council retained the authority to impose federal regulation upon a determination that the nonbank financial company was in “material financial distress” that “could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-234" href="#post-8599-footnote-234">[234]</a></sup> The Council defined that distress to include companies “in imminent danger of insolvency or defaulting on [their] financial obligations.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-235" href="#post-8599-footnote-235">[235]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582980"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531180"></a> C. The New Model Faces a New Test</h3>
<p>There are reasons to believe that this new approach is working. The COVID-19 pandemic offered an intense shock to the economy. Yet, it did not seriously threaten the financial sector, which not only survived the shock but helped the government provide aid to businesses adversely affected by it through a series of emergency lending programs.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-236" href="#post-8599-footnote-236">[236]</a></sup> Similarly, small businesses eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program were also meant to receive funds from the banks with which they had a relationship.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-237" href="#post-8599-footnote-237">[237]</a></sup> Banks, and above all the systemically important banks designated by FSOC, thus not only proved to be resilient enough to withstand a major shock but also assisted the government in providing aid to the rest of the economy, consistent with the partnership model that characterizes financial regulation.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-238" href="#post-8599-footnote-238">[238]</a></sup> As a result, the performance of the banking system was deemed to be good—and deemed to have been helped by the regulatory enhancements put in place by Dodd-Frank. As the Minneapolis Fed put it: “In the COVID-19 crisis, banks were the pillars on which the economic rescue stood, rather than beneficiaries of government handouts.<a id="post-8599-_Ref111968134"></a>”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-239" href="#post-8599-footnote-239">[239]</a></sup></p>
<p>Large bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation authorizing the Fed and Treasury to work through banks to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-240" href="#post-8599-footnote-240">[240]</a></sup> Banks designated as systemically important not only survived the crisis but also played important roles in the recovery, suggesting that designation had created resiliency without overly interfering with performance.</p>
<p>The systemic risk paradigm, in other words, proved to be a resilient and successful one in its first serious test and offered a springboard to the government to provide economic assistance to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Accordingly, those who wonder whether technology legislation on the part of Congress is unlikely—after all, legislation is difficult in the best of circumstances, and technology is controversial—may want to take heart in both the bipartisan nature of the systemic risk legislation in finance and in its performance during the pandemic.</p>
<h2><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582981"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531181"></a> III. Applying the Model</h2>
<p>The SIFI designation and FSOC’s structure should be used as a framework for systemically important technology firms. We are not proposing that they meet the specific SIFI designation criteria of FSOC. While some Big Tech platforms have significant and growing financial services operations, they do not yet compare as pure financial players to the big banks and other institutions that FSOC oversees. The relevant metrics for evaluating importance and systemic risk will not be the same outside of the financial context. Rather, we propose taking the financial services regime as a model and adapting it to the distinctive aspects of the technology context. As discussed in Part I, both very large and very important technology firms appear to be reaching a point where their failure would produce cascading effects that could disrupt the global economy. Traditional regulatory tools are not appropriate for these risks. We therefore examine what a systemic-importance regime for tech could look like.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this is an initial outline. Much work will need to be done to turn it into a concrete regulatory regime. By starting the analytical process, we hope to encourage other scholars, policymakers, and market participants to debate what components should be included in the designation regime, how they should be evaluated, and how best to construct an analogue of the FSOC.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582982"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531182"></a> A. Who: Systemically Important Network Institutions (SINIs)</h3>
<p>We propose that a new regulatory category be established through federal legislation, analogous to the creation of the SIFI designation established in Dodd-Frank. We label it Systemically Important Network Institutions (SINIs) to capture the fact that these are not just firms in the technology sector; they are intimately involved with the internet and related forms of connectivity. Of course, designation is not the only way to regulate the tech sector—it is not even the only way that the government could ensure the resiliency of tech firms.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-241" href="#post-8599-footnote-241">[241]</a></sup> But we think that identifying the particular institutions that form the backbone of the tech sector is a useful exercise and a productive way of thinking about big risks while identifying a limited number of designees required to take on new regulatory burdens. In what follows, we apply FSOC’s entity-focused blueprint to technology.</p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582983"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531183"></a> 1. Criteria for Designation</h4>
<p>The FSOC’s factors of size, interconnectedness, and substitutability might usefully be applied to the technology ecosystem. Important platforms—such as the cloud service providers whose outages have been so disruptive in the past, albeit, thankfully, not very sustained—could be scrutinized to see how they link up with the rest of the technology sector.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-242" href="#post-8599-footnote-242">[242]</a></sup> In fact, in a 2018 speech, Karen Petrou, Managing Partner of Federal Financial Analytics, argued that “looked at as if they were big banks, [technology] platform companies are systemically-important by the criteria now used to designate global systemically-important banks (GSIBs).”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-243" href="#post-8599-footnote-243">[243]</a></sup></p>
<p>Large tech platforms naturally interface with lots of other actors, but there is more to interconnectedness than just size. Is a platform too interconnected? Regulators could apply network mapping techniques to make this determination. There are well-established tools for evaluating power relationships in network models, which are widely applied in management and other fields.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-244" href="#post-8599-footnote-244">[244]</a></sup> Connection points among technology and other firms can be modeled in this way and used to determine which firms occupy positions of strong centrality. The team of RAND economists have already done so for one dimension—the relationships among firms, suppliers, and downstream customers.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-245" href="#post-8599-footnote-245">[245]</a></sup> There is no reason to think that, given the ability to obtain information from suspected interconnectors, the regulators could not do an even better job of teasing out which firms are the keystones to the technology ecosystem and therefore should be required to be more resilient.</p>
<p>In fact, this sort of interconnectedness inquiry could proceed along the lines that financial regulators use for SIFIs. Regulators could establish a simple threshold for interconnectedness, such as a dollar value of client firms or perhaps a number of users, request information from those firms for second-stage inquiry, and at a third stage invite the firms in to explain how they are or are not dangerously fundamental to the workings of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Nor need designation be something that these foundational firms should fear, because they will likely be able to pass on any extra regulatory compliance costs designed to enhance resiliency to their clients.</p>
<p>A similar sort of inquiry can be imagined over size and substitutability. Size could be established through gross revenues and substitutability by the ready availability of competitors along the lines of an antitrust inquiry. For substitutability, regulators could ask how quickly and easily clients of SINIs could switch from one firm to another. Here, the idea is that systemic importance does not come merely from popularity but from the existence—or lack thereof—of alternatives. If Google Maps went down, consumers could quickly switch to another maps program—or at least the debate would be whether this would be so. On the other hand, if backbone platforms like cloud services were hacked or went out of business suddenly, it might be difficult for firms relying on the cloud servers to move seamlessly to another cloud service platform. Eventually, the capacity of the cloud server ecosystem could become too cramped if a provider of about a third or so of cloud services stopped being able to perform its function.</p>
<p>The systemic risk inquiry might have some surprising outcomes. One could imagine a regulatory conclusion that Google, the largest technology firm in the world and the one on which the most consumers rely, would not be systemically important because of the ease with which replacement services could be stood up or switched over to. On the other hand, internet providers of back-office technology might prove to be especially interconnected and accordingly in need of extra attention to their resilience.</p>
<p>All of this requires a dynamic system where, as with financial regulation, designations can change as the market develops. Empowering regulators to make, and obligating them to revisit, systemically important designations would have this effect. Moreover, overseas regulators are aware of the importance of thinking broadly about systemically risky businesses. The European Union promulgated a directive in 2016 providing that digital infrastructure businesses “identified . . . as operators of essential services . . . will have to take appropriate security measures and notify relevant national authorities of serious incidents. Key digital service providers, such as search engines, cloud computing services, and online marketplaces, will have to comply with the security and notification requirements under the new Directive.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-246" href="#post-8599-footnote-246">[246]</a></sup> The implementation of this European Network and Information Systems (NIS) directive might provide further insights for development of the SINI structure.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-247" href="#post-8599-footnote-247">[247]</a></sup></p>
<h4><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582984"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531184"></a> 2. Which Entities Might Be Declared a SINI?</h4>
<p>Who might be subject to a systemic-importance designation? The starting point for consideration would be the Big Tech platforms such as the GAFAM giants. However, as we have discussed, size is only one factor in the inquiry. Systemic importance is not just an alternate route to restrain Big Tech to address concerns such as content moderation, privacy violations, and antitrust.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-248" href="#post-8599-footnote-248">[248]</a></sup> While imperfect, tools exist to address those issues. As the RAND study found, sometimes the most densely interconnected firms are not the biggest in terms of revenues.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-249" href="#post-8599-footnote-249">[249]</a></sup> The same is likely true for substitutability. Firms may dominate an important infrastructure niche and be so deeply embedded in processes through APIs that they are quite difficult to replace, even though they are relatively small.</p>
<p>Another important dimension is that the major tech platforms are not unitary. Amazon, for example, is a business-to-consumer e-commerce platform as well as a business-to-business cloud services provider.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-250" href="#post-8599-footnote-250">[250]</a></sup> These two businesses are symbiotic, and Amazon has significant market power in both.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-251" href="#post-8599-footnote-251">[251]</a></sup> However, Amazon’s AWS cloud business, which powers many different kinds of other firms, might be considered more systemically important than its e-commerce business. Apple sells devices such as the iPhone but also operates services such as its App Store platform and iCloud. And for firms such as Google and Meta, which are essentially conglomerates offering distinct yet interconnected products and services, the systemic-importance inquiry will need to assess whether to measure the whole or the parts.</p>
<p>For illustrative purposes, we offer a map of technology firms that might be determined as systemically important. We emphasize that this screen is preliminary; any analysis would need to evaluate size, interconnection, and substitutability empirically. As with the description of possible failure scenarios for systemically important technology firms,<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-252" href="#post-8599-footnote-252">[252]</a></sup> our goal is to stimulate thinking about where the greatest risks lie. One of the great benefits of a SINI framework is that it would encourage consideration of vulnerabilities that would otherwise be ignored because the firms involved are not the behemoths already under scrutiny.</p>
<h5>a. Cloud Infrastructure</h5>
<p>As already described, cloud infrastructure is a major area in which a small number of firms support a huge share of online activity. The cloud market is also highly concentrated. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google are 60% of the global market.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-253" href="#post-8599-footnote-253">[253]</a></sup> Because their business is to support services delivered by others, cloud infrastructure providers are necessarily highly interconnected with other firms. Whether there is sufficient substitutability would be an important question for a SINI designation inquiry.</p>
<h5>b. Communications Infrastructure</h5>
<p>The communications industry is subject to comprehensive regulation through the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies because of the combination of its societal importance and its tendency toward natural monopolies due to cost characteristics and network effects. While the sectoral communications regulatory regime is different in many ways from the horizontal systemic-importance inquiry we propose, it is similar in imposing obligations above and beyond generic ones such as consumer protection and antitrust. In the internet era, the question is whether firms that are traditionally regulated service providers, such as telephone and cable television companies, should nonetheless be subject to requirements based on their systemic importance. Internet service providers have significant power, which has led to efforts to impose network-neutrality requirements.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-254" href="#post-8599-footnote-254">[254]</a></sup> However, because they are providers of the physical wiring or wireless connections between end-users and the internet, their scope is necessarily geographically limited. A Verizon outage will not impact Comcast customers, even in the same city, nor will it likely affect Verizon users in other cities.</p>
<p>The communications services that generate systemic risks will operate at the application layer of the network, or at the software-infrastructure layer. The biggest segment in the former category involves multi-party video communications. Zoom in particular rose to prominence just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic as the primary method that many millions of individuals and thousands of organizations used to communicate.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-255" href="#post-8599-footnote-255">[255]</a></sup> Even after businesses and educational institutions have returned to in-person activities, remote or hybrid interaction remains a permanent feature for many meetings and classes. Zoom, as well as the business-focused video communications platforms provided by Microsoft and Google, would appropriately be considered for a systemically important designation.</p>
<h5>c. Network Infrastructure</h5>
<p>The software infrastructure of networks would be the next area to seek systemically important providers. As already described, the RAND study found that GoDaddy, a relatively obscure provider of domain name registration services, was one of the most deeply interconnected firms in the U.S. economy.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-256" href="#post-8599-footnote-256">[256]</a></sup> This is no doubt because it provides an essential element of connectivity for so many businesses. Content delivery networks such as Akamai and Cloudflare, which maintain network performance and overcome denial-of-service attacks, are in a similar position.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-257" href="#post-8599-footnote-257">[257]</a></sup> None of these firms are massive by traditional metrics. Size is one of the factors for designation we adopt from the financial services model, so that might be enough to defeat a SINI classification. However, these firms touch many more users than the ones they serve directly.</p>
<h5>d. Application Infrastructure</h5>
<p>Moving higher up in the network stack, there are also a set of software infrastructure providers for the applications and services provided over the internet, as opposed to for the baseline connectivity. Shopify, for example, is the dominant provider of e-commerce storefront capabilities to all but the largest businesses.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-258" href="#post-8599-footnote-258">[258]</a></sup> Twilio powers the majority of communications-oriented services, such as click-to-call functionality or text messaging, initiated through internet-based services.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-259" href="#post-8599-footnote-259">[259]</a></sup> Stripe and Square power all sorts of online payment activity; they are the glue behind the scenes that link traditional financial services systems such as credit card networks with internet activity.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-260" href="#post-8599-footnote-260">[260]</a></sup> As with the network software infrastructure, these providers are relatively small, and there is significant concentration in each market segment.</p>
<h5>e. Enterprise IT SAAS</h5>
<p>Finally, there are internet-connected software as a service (SAAS) providers that could be systemically important because of their essential functionality for other businesses. The human resources software leader Workday, for example, shows up in the RAND study of most-interconnected firms.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-261" href="#post-8599-footnote-261">[261]</a></sup> Salesforce, the dominant customer relationship management platform, and the enterprise resource planning provider SAP, might also be essential to so many firms that their failure would rise to the level of systemic risk. These firms provide important infrastructure for traditional businesses the way the prior two categories power online services.</p>
<h5>f. What’s Not on the List</h5>
<p>This list does not include many of the companies one might initially expect, such as Facebook and Twitter. One aspect of the GAFAM tech giants is that their end customers are primarily consumers. Facebook casts a long shadow because of its influence over social interaction, news, and political discourse. In terms of economic importance, however, a Facebook outage might not have the same devastating consequences as an outage of a large bank. Losing access to updates from your friends and family is not the same as losing access to your money. And Twitter, despite its political and media footprint, is used by less than a quarter of U.S. adults.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-262" href="#post-8599-footnote-262">[262]</a></sup> Again, a fuller designation analysis would need to be done to assess empirically whether the standard was met.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582985"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531185"></a> B. Where: The TechSOC</h3>
<p>We propose that a council of relevant federal regulators be brought together to identify and supervise Systemically Important Network Institutions, or SINIs. By analogy to FSOC, this would be designated the Technology Stability Oversight Council, or TechSOC.</p>
<p>The TechSOC would be comprised of the heads of relevant federal entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Communications Commission is the primary federal regulator of the telecommunications and media sectors.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-263" href="#post-8599-footnote-263">[263]</a></sup> Despite its technical expertise, the FCC does not directly oversee digital platforms today because its statutory jurisdiction is limited outside of telecommunications providers, broadcasters, cable companies, and satellite communications firms.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-264" href="#post-8599-footnote-264">[264]</a></sup> However, the FCC adopted network-neutrality rules in 2015 by classifying the internet as a telecommunications service (although the decision was reversed in 2018 under the Trump Administration).<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-265" href="#post-8599-footnote-265">[265]</a></sup> It also has relevant experience as the agency that oversees network reliability for telecommunications networks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-266" href="#post-8599-footnote-266">[266]</a></sup></li>
<li>Federal Trade Commission, through its authority to police unfair and deceptive trade practices, is the de facto federal privacy regulator, and has also investigated firms for insufficient security practices.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-267" href="#post-8599-footnote-267">[267]</a></sup> It is also involved in antitrust oversight, including for technology firms.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-268" href="#post-8599-footnote-268">[268]</a></sup></li>
<li>Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the Department of Homeland Security is the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-269" href="#post-8599-footnote-269">[269]</a></sup></li>
<li>The Federal Reserve would serve as the connection point between the TechSOC and FSOC, lending its experience in regulation of systemically important financial institutions. In recent years, the Fed has also developed relevant expertise in cybersecurity and dangers of technology-related market disruptions.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-270" href="#post-8599-footnote-270">[270]</a></sup></li>
<li>National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the Department of Commerce is the Executive Branch coordinator for internet and communications policy.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-271" href="#post-8599-footnote-271">[271]</a></sup></li>
<li>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory entity but might be included as a liaison because of its role in developing federal technology standards, including for cybersecurity.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-272" href="#post-8599-footnote-272">[272]</a></sup></li>
<li>If a new digital platform agency is created, it would also be included in the TechSOC.</li>
</ul>
<p>This collection of tech regulators could usefully draw lessons from the experience of financial regulators in identifying vulnerabilities in an increasingly interconnected system. The TechSOC structure would also force information sharing and other forms of informal coordination among agencies that otherwise have only a piece of the relevant information.</p>
<p>FSOC has a chair in the Treasury Secretary, but our ideal council would not be run by a political appointee close to the President and could, potentially, include both Democratic and Republican representatives from the independent agencies in an effort to move the council out of the realm of politics. Many other administrative aspects of the TechSOC would need to be determined in any enabling legislation. Our purpose here is to establish generally the need for something along these lines, recognizing the need for further analysis to generate a fully formed proposal.</p>
<p>The creation of a TechSOC is, in our view, superior to some alternatives. We have a FSOC dedicated to matters of systemic risk, including, at least in theory, systemic risk that arises outside of the financial system, but it would be an inexpert regulator of technology. The TechSOC could adopt the approach of FSOC, while deploying the expertise of its members to identify systemic risk in tech. Rather than a council of technology-interested agencies, we could create a new super agency to regulate tech risk, but the council model reduces the risk of jurisdictional conflict between a new agency and its counterparts with other responsibilities in the technology sector. The council model, moreover, appears to have done well during the COVID-19 crisis, as we have observed, and so in some ways has won the right to be replicated.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-273" href="#post-8599-footnote-273">[273]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582986"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531186"></a> C. What: Consequences for SINIs</h3>
<p>This regulatory body would be conducting a different sort of inquiry than do other regulators: one informed by, if different than, the role that FSOC plays in assuring financial stability.</p>
<p>Both financial regulators and our technology oversight council would be looking for systemic risks posed by individual firms. In practice, this means a search for highly nonlocal effects of local disruptions. In the financial system, the analogy is often drawn to contagion. One firm suffers from, say, a bank run, and the effects are not only felt by it but by its counterparties, by firms that resemble it, and by firms that depend on those firms in turn.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-274" href="#post-8599-footnote-274">[274]</a></sup> The robust interconnectedness of the financial system, while a source of efficient capital allocation in normal times, makes it susceptible to panics and crises in bad times.</p>
<p>Portions of the technology ecosystem have the potential to exhibit a similar kind of dynamic<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-275" href="#post-8599-footnote-275">[275]</a></sup> and therefore would benefit from a similar kind of regulatory inquiry. The question would be whether local difficulties in this ecosystem would also have highly nonlocal effects.</p>
<p>We expect that the TechSOC would want to conduct studies looking for this kind of potential problem. The council might also look for choke points in the ecosystem—places where interconnectedness narrows and is concentrated. The search for such choke points is not only a matter for financial regulation. Health and safety regulators look for choke points in supply chains as good places to worry about alternatives and conversely, in some cases, focus their limited bandwidth.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-276" href="#post-8599-footnote-276">[276]</a></sup> Food regulators might therefore do inspections at ports rather than by trying to surveil every farm that produces consumable exports. In finance, the FSOC has facilitated the move of derivatives trading to exchanges and away from bespoke dealmaking by banks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-277" href="#post-8599-footnote-277">[277]</a></sup> The idea is that the public observability offered by the exchanges will give regulators and others interested in the stability of the derivatives markets a window into sudden market moves. At the same time, the FSOC has designated these exchanges as systemically important and accordingly subject to extra regulatory requirements, particularly requirements to hold capital.</p>
<p>On the other hand, technology regulators might view portions of the technology ecosystem that provide for interoperability as places where the choke-point risk has been addressed, substitutes have been welcomed, and because of the presence of alternatives, the concern about highly nonlocal effects of local collapses has become less salient.</p>
<p>The TechSOC would also look to finance-like factors in assessing the possibility of systemic risk.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-278" href="#post-8599-footnote-278">[278]</a></sup> Once it has identified particular firms—and perhaps certain widespread practices, if appropriate—as systemically important, it could then require those firms to engage in a particular suite of activities.</p>
<p>The most notable of these activities would likely be a new form of the stress test.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-279" href="#post-8599-footnote-279">[279]</a></sup> American regulators require large financial institutions to conduct stress tests on the basis of a regularly changed version of hypothetical adverse scenarios—one year it might be a shock to the housing market, another year, an adverse climate scenario.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-280" href="#post-8599-footnote-280">[280]</a></sup> Those institutions are also obligated to develop their own periodic stress tests simulating liquidity shocks.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-281" href="#post-8599-footnote-281">[281]</a></sup> Mehrsa Baradaran has called this “regulation by hypothetical,”<a id="post-8599-_Ref95746786"></a><sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-282" href="#post-8599-footnote-282">[282]</a></sup> as the stress tests (and living wills, for that matter)—metaphors from medicine, as Robert Weber has observed<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-283" href="#post-8599-footnote-283">[283]</a></sup>—to change bank conduct.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-284" href="#post-8599-footnote-284">[284]</a></sup> Stress tests, which Dodd-Frank required of banks and regulators, meant that the most systemically important banks had to, as the Fed put it, prove “their ability to withstand an extremely adverse hypothetical economic scenario.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-285" href="#post-8599-footnote-285">[285]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stress tests for technology firms offer a similar kind of opportunity. Regulators could obligate systemically important technology outfits to perform an annual or semiannual emergency drill, requiring them to subject their programs to unlikely and adverse scenarios to provide both the firms and the government with some comfort that technology companies that passed the test would be capable of doing well in difficult times.</p>
<p>A second promising requirement for systemically important technology firms would be the creation of the living will. In finance, large banks and nonbank companies designated as systemic are required to file annual resolution plans, which are commonly known as the living will.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-286" href="#post-8599-footnote-286">[286]</a></sup> In such a plan, an institution needs to provide detailed information about its structure and operations and explain how it plans to carry out a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code without seeking extraordinary government support should a disastrous failure happen.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-287" href="#post-8599-footnote-287">[287]</a></sup> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Fed jointly review the credibility and feasibility of the living will and provide written notice of deficiencies to institutions that fail to meet the agencies’ review standard.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-288" href="#post-8599-footnote-288">[288]</a></sup> If those institutions fail to appropriately revise and resubmit their plans, they may be subject to “more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements,” encounter “restrictions on its growth, activities, or operations,” or even be dismantled through “forced divestitures of its assets.”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-289" href="#post-8599-footnote-289">[289]</a></sup></p>
<p>This creation of the Dodd-Frank Act is meant to concentrate the mind of the regulated business, prevent the financial conglomerates from being too big to fail, and make the inevitable collapse of these big institutions less destructive.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-290" href="#post-8599-footnote-290">[290]</a></sup> By providing a roadmap as to what would happen upon a disastrous collapse of operations, they serve as a <em>memento mori</em> to the firm<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-291" href="#post-8599-footnote-291">[291]</a></sup> and a regulatory-required opportunity to engage in crisis planning and emergency preparedness. Additionally, as then-member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Dan Tarullo explained, “the information requirements of living wills and the need to measure and manage risks at the legal entity level can help create the right incentives for firms to simplify their structures,”<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-292" href="#post-8599-footnote-292">[292]</a></sup> which in turn would also strengthen their stability.</p>
<p>Finally, systemically risky finance firms are obligated to hold extra capital against their assets, so that there is a cushion of equity that can be deployed to soak up losses before those losses can be visited on other providers of capital to the firm.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-293" href="#post-8599-footnote-293">[293]</a></sup> The largest worry is that depositors might find their deposits impaired in a crisis. The analogy in technology would be an emergency, “rainy day” fund. Technology firms in distress would have the ability to draw on financial resources to address the crisis quickly; this deployment of emergency financing could bring in hackers to address the consequences of a hack, programmers to bolster the firm in the event of a disastrous programming bug, and so on.</p>
<p>Financial regulators charge the extra regulation required of systemically important firms to the Fed. It is less obvious who precisely on or around TechSOC could serve a similar role in technology oversight. A good systemic risk regulator would include not just lawyers, but technologists and programmers, to say nothing of economists and computer scientists. Our current regulatory environment does not feature such an agency with such a broad remit and multifarious talents among its staff. It could be that a task force of agencies would be the appropriate applicators of the stress testing and reviewers of the living wills, not to mention promoters of other markers of resiliency.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-294" href="#post-8599-footnote-294">[294]</a></sup> Technology policy experts muse about the creation of a new agency responsible for oversight of the sector; and if Congress were to create such an agency, it would belong on the Oversight Council, and perhaps serve as the conduit of the extra regulations on systemically important businesses.<sup><a id="post-8599-footnote-ref-295" href="#post-8599-footnote-295">[295]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="post-8599-_Toc95582987"></a><a id="post-8599-_Toc128531187"></a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>We mean our approach to be something of a thought experiment, but care must be taken in the implementation of a systemic risk framework. We think that tech platforms and backbones could, if they collapsed, have some cascading effects. But it is certainly the case that the contagion of a financial panic—where good firms get pulled in after bad ones and bad news can lead to fire sales, which can look like more bad news, requiring more selling into panics—is a unique problem rooted in the unique fragility and interconnectedness of the financial sector. Not every paradigmatic financial regulatory scheme has an obvious cognate in tech regulation; the capital requirements that banks have, designed to insulate a bank against a fall in asset values, does not have a clear analog in cyber infrastructure, though there may be merit in rainy-day-fund requirements for some systemically important technology firms.</p>
<p>There is a pressing need for new insights in technology regulation. Even as the sector becomes more important, efforts to address its dangers are stymied in partisan fights and fixated on a narrow list of issues. A systemic risk regulation structure would provide a way for policymakers to ensure, hand-in-hand with technology firms themselves, that firms are resilient and that the system is a strong one. For tech platforms that have become too big to fail, we can no longer afford to focus energy only on their bigness. We must take steps to prevent the catastrophic fallout of their failure.</p>

The Fed’s interest in the area has grown but has longstanding roots. As Peter Conti-Brown and David Wishnick have put it:By the 1970s, the Fed not only had teams of technologists at the individual Reserve Banks but also had a specialized team dedicated to long-range telecommunications planning, which developed an early example of a packet-switched network as part of the Division of Data Services. Along with these investments in advanced infrastructure came investments in security and redundancy to prevent costly system outages. Today, the Fed is a large employer of cybersecurity personnel—witness the over one hundred analysts who comprise the National Incident Response Team, dedicated to responding to the highest-impact threats to the Federal Reserve System and the broader financial sector, especially those incidents that involve attempts to penetrate Fed computers.Peter Conti-Brown &amp; David A.
