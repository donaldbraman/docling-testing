"In a recent issue of this Review , Spencer Bowley explains why interest convergence, which once improved Black American fortunes, now stands to benefit the working class in the United States. 1 Bowley reviews historical parallels, 2 current international conditions, 3 and case law on poverty as a suspect class 4 to show how competition from China and a pent-up desire from middleand working-class people may motivate the ruling class to make unprecedented concessions in favor of workers and the poor. 5",body_text,text,0.9842209072978304,3,4,bu_law_review_interest_convergence_working_class
"We agree and in fact see little reason to believe that interest convergence need confine itself to the field of minority rights alone. Indeed, we posit that the classforward movement Bowley foresees has already begun, mainly in the form of legislation dating to the early months of the Biden Administration aimed at increasing blue-collar jobs and strengthening the social welfare safety net, 6 plus a few tentative steps in the State Department to strengthen ties with allies against the China threat. 7",body_text,text,0.9930761622156281,4,5,bu_law_review_interest_convergence_working_class
