First, Donald Trump's presidency saw a significant deterioration of the U.S.-China relationship, stemming from various accusations (whether or not based in fact) of unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and civil rights abuses that President Trump threw at the Asian nation, as well as a trade war that threatened China's food security. 64 At the same time, it seems the United States' relationships with both Latin America and Africa were shoved to the wayside, viewed mostly or entirely through the lens of how they could be leveraged in the context of the U.S.-China relationship. 65 Finally, insinuations that African nations were 'shithole countries,' 66 that even legal immigrants from Latin America are likely unwelcome rapists or criminals, 67 and that China or the Chinese were somehow to blame for the coronavirus, 68 did no favors regarding sentiment toward the United States in those respective nations.",body_text,text,0.9883122954651706,23,102,bu_law_review_learning_from_history

Williams , 92 a case that upheld Maryland's maximum family welfare limit. 93 Many scholars believe the Supreme Court has since declared that the poor are not a suspect class for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. 94 Overturning this belief would subject laws that discriminate on the basis of class to either strict scrutiny (if the class is suspect) or intermediate scrutiny (if the class is quasi-suspect). 95 To survive strict scrutiny, a classification on the basis of a suspect class must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and be necessary to accomplish a legitimate governmental purpose, whereas to survive intermediate scrutiny, a classification on the basis of a quasi-suspect class must serve an important governmental objective and be substantially related to that objective. 96",body_text,text,0.9899140829286515,30,142,bu_law_review_learning_from_history

Seattle School District No. 1 114 fifteen years later. In Parents Involved , Justice Roberts for the Court found 'integration positive' public school student assignment plans using race as one criteria for determining what school a student should attend unconstitutional because '[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.' 115 Bell noted:",body_text,text,0.9490925188136343,38,177,bu_law_review_learning_from_history

"The second failure of Brown is, in a way, a sad confirmation of its proclamation that separate schools are not equal schools. The American method of financing public education with local property taxes ensures that schools located in areas where poor children live are poorly funded while schools located where wealthy children live are funded lavishly. 124 Parents and activists have sought, with limited success, an enduring legal solution to this inequitable system since their hopes that the Supreme Court might find it unconstitutional were dashed in 1973. 125 The average revenue of a school district that is over 75% White is $2,226 more per pupil than the average revenue of a school district that is over 75% nonwhite. 126 Additionally, there is a significant link between racial school segregation and academic achievement gaps, driven largely by this racial difference in school poverty. 127",body_text,text,0.9933628318584071,42,194,bu_law_review_learning_from_history
"This failure to realize a racially equal education system can be explained within the confines of interest-convergence theory by noting that the interest of elite actors in question was not the achievement of racial equality itself. It was being able to send the signal of racial equality. Dudziak notes that by around 1966, the Vietnam War had significantly eclipsed domestic race relations in the United States as the defining feature of international viewpoints of the United States. 128 Five years later, the Supreme Court's new conservative Chief Justice noted the 'reconciliation of competing values' 129 in desegregation cases, and shortly after that the Court began limiting federal power to mandate desegregation. 130 The international usefulness of active desegregation efforts had worn off, and the stage was set for retrenchment.",body_text,text,0.9910979228486647,43,195,bu_law_review_learning_from_history
