"In this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has significantly undermined the effectiveness of many privacy laws. Through the standing doctrine, the U.S. Supreme Court essentially nullified a key enforcement component of many privacy laws-private rights of action. The decision in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez 1 revisits the issue of standing and privacy harms under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the 'FCRA') that began with Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins 2 in 2016. 3 This case arguably strikes a major blow to the enforcement of privacy laws in the federal courts. While state courts do not have the same restrictive rules to hearing cases and controversies, federal standing rules have a way of leaching into judicial thinking. So TransUnion may have reverberations beyond just the federal courts.",body_text,text,0.990427568602425,2,2,bu_law_review_standing_privacy_harms

If Spokeo and TransUnion are carried to their logical conclusion, common and longstanding private rights of action for countless laws, including copyright law, might no longer be viable in federal court.
