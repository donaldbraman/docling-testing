"Amazon's dominance as a platform is widely documented. But one aspect of that dominance has not received sufficient attention-the Amazon Brand Registry's sweeping influence on firm behavior, particularly in relation to the formal trademark system. Amazon's Brand Registry serves as a shadow trademark system that dramatically affects businesses' incentives to seek legal registration of their marks. The result has been a surge in the number of applications to register, which has swamped the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and created delays for all applicants, even those that previously would have registered their marks. And the increased value of federal registration has drawn in bad actors who fraudulently register marks that are in use by others on the Amazon platform and use those registrations to extort the true owners.",body_text,text,0.9940476190476191,0,2,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"Amazon's policies also create incentives for businesses to adopt different kinds of marks. Specifically, businesses are more likely to claim descriptive or generic terms, advantageously in stylized form or with accompanying images, and to game the scope limitations that would ordinarily attend registration of those marks. And the same Amazon policies have given rise to the phenomenon of 'nonsense marks,' which are strings of letters and numbers unrecognizable as words or symbols. In the midst of these systemic changes, Amazon has consolidated its own branding practices, focusing on a few core brands and expanding its use of those marks across a wide range of products. In combination, Amazon's business model and Brand Registry have overhauled the American trademark system, and they have done so with very little public recognition of the consequences of Amazon's business approach.",body_text,text,0.9943883277216611,1,7,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"The Brand Registry is, most basically, a private dispute resolution system that allows mark owners to object to unauthorized uses of their marks on Amazon without having to file formal legal proceedings. 6 What makes Amazon's system different than other private dispute resolution systems is the extent to which it influences parties' behavior within the legal system itself. 7 The Brand Registry not only gives parties a cheaper and more efficient way to resolve disputes, but it also creates incentives for parties to use the trademark system differently than they otherwise would, and in ways that were not anticipated in the design of that system.",body_text,text,0.9923312883435583,5,19,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Most directly, the Brand Registry has changed the incentives to register trademarks. The American trademark system is use-based: Trademark rights arise out of use, not registration, and registration in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) simply records those rights and provides certain enforcement benefits. 8 But because unregistered marks have long been enforceable under federal law on largely the same terms as registered marks, 9 unregistered rights have often been perfectly adequate for many smaller businesses. Indeed, the availability of those unregistered rights has traditionally been seen as a benefit of the American system for small and medium-sized businesses. 10",body_text,text,0.9934545454545455,6,20,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Amazon's policies have shifted that calculus because parties can participate in the Brand Registry in the United States only if their mark is registered with the PTO-or, as of very recently, if their application to register is pending. 11 Given Amazon's dominance as an online shopping platform, small and mediumsized businesses feel compelled to sell on the platform, and registration in the PTO is the ticket to the meaningful enforcement and search benefits provided to participants in the Brand Registry. 12 Businesses therefore have strong incentives to register marks when they previously would have relied on unregistered rights. 13",body_text,text,0.9875195007800313,7,21,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"By conditioning participation in the Brand Registry on PTO registration or at least an application to register, Amazon has created opportunities for pirates to extort sellers that operate on the platform using unregistered marks. 17 Like old-fashioned cybersquatters, these bad actors apply to register the unregistered marks in their own names and then seek to extort the true owners of those marks by threatening the owners with exclusion from Amazon's platform.",body_text,text,0.9946178686759957,9,32,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Not only does the Brand Registry increase incentives to register marks for which the owners would previously have relied on unregistered rights, but it also creates incentives for businesses to adopt different kinds of marks. Descriptive terms (like NATIONAL CAR RENTAL for nationwide car rental services) and generic terms (such as APPLE for apples) are especially more valuable in light of Amazon's policies. 18 Descriptive words are normally not protectable or registrable without evidence that consumers actually associate the term with a single source (what trademark law calls 'secondary meaning'), and this additional proof requirement is supposed to be a deterrent to claiming descriptive terms. 19 Generic terms are categorically excluded from protection, even if they have secondary meaning. 20 Despite these rules, there has always been some incentive to claim descriptive and generic terms as trademarks because control over those terms can provide meaningful competitive benefits. 21 But with Amazon, there is an overwhelming incentive to control descriptive or generic terms because consumers often use those terms to search on Amazon.",body_text,text,0.9921807124239791,10,33,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"The Brand Registry's structure also enables parties to game the trademark registration system and effectively get the full benefits of exclusive rights in descriptive and maybe even generic terms. 22 Of particular relevance, parties can avoid descriptiveness and genericness rejections in the PTO by applying to register those terms in a stylized format (such as a particular font) or with an accompanying image, sometimes disclaiming rights in the descriptive or generic word(s) themselves. In those cases, trademark law supposedly limits the scope of rights accorded to the registered mark to reflect the stylization or accompanying image. 23 But while Amazon is capable of considering the format in which a mark is presented, it does not require visual matching: A simple text match is sufficient to trigger exclusion. 24 That means a highly descriptive term, and maybe even a generic one, might be deemed registrable in the PTO because of its stylization but then enforced on Amazon as if it were a registration of the unprotectable word itself. That gaming disrupts the balance that the formal legal system tries to strike between recognition of the source-identifying capacity of design features on the one hand and the need for competitive access to descriptive and generic terms on the other, ignoring the reasons why those marks get any protection at all. 25",body_text,text,0.9948867786705624,11,42,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"Critics of excessive branding might rejoice about that de-centering and potential democratization of the online marketplace.

And it certainly enhances the value of Amazon's own branding strategies, as reflected in the massive expansion of products sold under the Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials brands. 31 Amazon controls the platform and can preference its own products in search results based on product descriptor keywords, making its house brand more important than product line brands.

"We do not claim that Amazon specifically intended to affect the trademark system in any of the ways we describe or even that Amazon has fully understood the extent of its impact. It seems very likely that Amazon adopted policies that it thought were sensible for its business and that it created the Brand Registry in part to address actual concerns about counterfeit goods and product liabilityand, not incidentally, to avoid regulation like it would face under Congress's proposed SHOP SAFE Act. 34 In that regard, it may be that Amazon's policies and practices have simply had the unintended, though not necessarily unforeseeable, consequences that we describe.",body_text,text,0.9939849624060151,16,56,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Another set of questions focuses more specifically on the overall effects of Amazon's policies on competition and on trademark law's normative commitments. As we describe, Amazon's model and its policies likely increase its own power vis-à-vis third-party brands, de-centering branding more generally. The net value of that shift may be in the eye of the beholder: It depends on how one weighs the potential benefits of search simplification and lower prices for consumers, as well as the ease of marketplace entry for third-party sellers, against the costs of Amazon's increased power over third-party sellers. Likewise, the benefits of a reduction in the power of brands depend on whether alternative search tools, particularly algorithms that focus on product information and consumer reviews, convey relevant information to consumers as effectively as trademarks. In the end, whether and how we should respond to Amazon's effects on the trademark system depends on whether we want the trademark system to demand that trademarks play their traditional role or whether instead the facts on the ground have changed so much that the premises of that system no longer hold.",body_text,text,0.9957337883959044,18,65,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"Third-party sellers' widespread participation in Amazon's Brand Registry has not only promoted Amazon's business model. As this Part addresses, it has also put significant hydraulic pressure on the U.S. trademark system, in effect overhauling the system and calling into question many of trademark law's foundational assumptions. 186 Because Amazon's Brand Registry is built on the U.S. trademark registration system-as opposed to being a system entirely of Amazon's creation-businesses have developed very different practices with regard to the selection and registration of trademarks. In this Part, we detail some of the most significant of these changed practices: small businesses' increased use of the trademark register, trademark extortion, registration of descriptive and generic marks, and registration of nonsense marks. We also discuss how Amazon's use of its own internal house brands fits into this story. These changes have happened relatively quietly without much public attention, but they have materially overhauled the trademark system.",body_text,text,0.9796305068687826,72,322,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"186. We focus on the U.S. trademark system. Even though there are parallel versions of Amazon's Brand Registry in other countries, see Brand Registry Eligibility , A MAZON , https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility [https://perma.cc/4KPE-QUDJ], the effects of each registry are principally domestic. That is because a third-party seller needs trademark rights in a particular country to take advantage of the Brand Registry's features to sell to customers in that country. Id. Moreover, trademark systems in other countries are different, such as with regard to the requirement of use in commerce, see, e.g. , Barton Beebe & Jeanne C. Fromer, The Future of Trademarks in a Global Multilingual Economy: Evidence and Lessons from the European Union , 112 T RADEMARK R EP . 902, 916-29 (2022), so it makes sense to analyze the effects of the Brand Registry on a country-by-country basis. By comparison, it might be more sensible to evaluate other platforms' shadow legal systems globally.

"For the reasons described in Part III.A, Amazon's Brand Registry increases businesses' incentives to seek PTO registration. It also affects the types of marks for which parties seek registration, significantly increasing business incentives to register generic and descriptive terms. Recall that trademark law categorically refuses to protect or register generic terms like 'apple' for a company selling apples; it does so to prevent businesses from monopolizing those terms to the detriment of competition. 224 And descriptive terms like AMERICAN AIRLINES for an American airline are protectable only if they have developed secondary meaning. 225",body_text,text,0.9814814814814815,92,406,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"As discussed by one of us in prior work, businesses have long had an incentive to choose a descriptive or generic term as a mark when they think that 'consumers will rely on [the term] to seek out their products even though consumers do not associate that term with them as a source.' 226 For example, once upon a time, a business might have chosen a generic term in the hope that a telephone operator would direct business to them when a consumer requested a particular category of goods or services. 227 But the value of that strategy has likely increased sharply in the search engine era. Now, businesses can capitalize on consumers using generic or descriptive terms as search terms, even when those consumers are not looking for any particular provider of goods or services. 228 Indeed, courts have sometimes recognized the competitive advantage that highly descriptive marks have in these search listings-marks like 24 HOUR FITNESS for a gym that is always open, 229 1-800 CONTACTS for contact lenses, 230 HOME-MARKET.COM for homeowner referral services, 231 and BOOKING.COM for travel booking services. 232",body_text,text,0.9879086430810569,93,407,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"Amazon's business model, combined with its Brand Registry, disrupts this traditional calculus by increasing the benefits of using and even seeking to register descriptive or generic terms. A business might reasonably conclude that it wants to use a descriptive or generic term as a mark for its Amazon-sold goods to improve the odds of prominent placement in search results. Companies have already been adopting names like 'Thai Food Near Me' or 'Plumber Near Me' to promote themselves in Google search results for those exact terms. 236 The incentive to use generic or descriptive terms is likely even greater for goods sold on Amazon because Amazon's search results put consumers directly into a position to buy the listed goods they see, regardless of brand. As one recent academic analysis of Amazon puts it, 'Although in theory Amazon's digital shelf space is limitless, in practice the first few results-especially those on the first page of the smartphone screen-are tremendously important. According to industry research, more than two-thirds of product clicks happen on the first page of Amazon's search results, with half of those focused on the first two rows of products that appear.' 237",body_text,text,0.7502081598667777,95,420,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"source of the goods or services with which they are used. 261 Those refusals for what the PTO calls 'failure to function' are typically based on contextual determinations: They focus on whether a particular sign functions as a mark as it is shown in a particular specimen of use. 262 That is why the failure-to-function doctrine has primarily focused on the location of a claimed mark and not its intrinsic nature. Consumers often recognize that a sign is a trademark when it is located in a prototypical 'trademark space,' even if they have not previously encountered that mark, but signs used in other places may not be understood by consumers as trademarks at all. 263 Nonsense marks likely do not function as marks, but the reason is their intrinsic nature, not that they do not indicate source when used in a particular manner.

"Even likelihood of confusion, the standard used to assess trademark infringement, is complicated in the context of nonsense marks. Trademark law does not have a good way of assessing similarity when one of the things being compared is not comprehensible as a word or understandable as a symbol. Similarity is usually assessed in terms of sight, sound, and meaning, and only sight is even possibly relevant for nonsense marks. 265 Is NXLYP confusingly similar to NYLPX, or for that matter to PTXWA? On the one hand, these marks might not be confusing because confusion depends on the ability to attach external meaning to the terms-in that sense, because people do not attach any meaning to nonsense marks, they might rarely be similar enough to cause confusion. On the other hand, it might be that all nonsense marks are potentially confused with other nonsense marks because none of them are distinct. Either way, trademark law has no good framework to evaluate such confusion. 266 Perhaps just as troubling is that a nonsense mark might be seen as confusingly similar to a more traditional mark, such as McLaughlin's examples of MAJCF being confused with MAJI, or JANRSTIC with JANSTICK, preventing the more traditional mark applicant from being able to register their mark in the face of the already-registered nonsense mark. 267",body_text,text,0.9951256092988376,108,565,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

In that vein, West observes that 'Amazon has . . . leveraged the trust that consumers have in its brand to launch sub-brands' like AMAZON BASICS and AMAZON ESSENTIALS. 308 Furthermore, Amazon's de-centering of third-party branding, which is the same de-centering that leads many businesses to opt for nonsense marks, 309 likely amplifies Amazon's own branding strategies.

"But Amazon's model differs from Sears's in two key ways. First, just about any third-party business can partner with Amazon to sell any of its wares on Amazon's platform. 330 By contrast, Sears would internally determine which products it wanted to sell and then solicit particular third-party businesses to manufacture those items. Second, Amazon has considerably more power vis-àvis small businesses than Sears did. Businesses operating in Sears' heyday could still thrive without Sears by engaging in local commerce, which was then more prominent. 331 Sears therefore did not have the grip that Amazon has on thirdparty business practices.

At the very least, the effects we have described here should force us to reflect on whether we are comfortable with a single company setting internal rules for its own benefit when the effect is to reconfigure a legal system that was not developed with such a powerful actor in mind.

Importantly, it is seeking to ward off prospective regulation that would expose the company to products liability claims and liability for counterfeits sold on its platform. 378 Amazon's leveraging of the trademark system is not incidental to that goal.

For example, consider applications for descriptive or generic terms that businesses operating on Amazon might be tempted to seek. 398 For well-considered reasons, the trademark system makes it harder, if not impossible, to obtain protection for rights in these terms because of the impact that protection can have on fair competition. 399 It is much easier to register descriptive or generic terms if they are stylized or accompanied by an image. 400 Indeed, the PTO might very well require an applicant to disclaim rights in the descriptive or generic term itself. 401",body_text,text,0.9933719966859983,169,864,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"More broadly, Amazon's policies result in behavior that tends to undermine the trademark system's core assumptions. In particular, that happens when thirdparty sellers pick descriptive, generic, or nonsense terms to use on Amazon. Use of those marks contravenes trademark law's central premise that marks serve to identify the source of goods or services and as shorthand for their qualities and characteristics. 404 The reasons are assorted yet related. By their nature, those kinds of marks are unlikely to be memorable to consumers, let alone associated with a particular source. But those features are less important on Amazon, where consumers can rely on product searches, product reviews, and the pull of Amazon as a brand to find and buy products. 405 Some kind of mark is needed to be in the Brand Registry, but that mark does not need to carry all of the weight that trademarks traditionally have been expected to.",body_text,text,0.9929691725256896,171,872,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

A related harm is that many of these businesses, particularly the ones registering nonsense marks, are primed to rebrand with a new (nonsense) mark if they get sufficiently negative product reviews on Amazon. Such rebranding would give them an opportunity to resurface on Amazon with the same product but with a clean slate. And it is not as if consumers remembered the mark anyhow. While such rebranding might also see to contravene trademark's core values, trademark law does not stand in the way of businesses rebranding, as can happen when a business wants to escape scandal, as with ValuJet Airlines becoming AirTran Airways after a plane crash; an association with a negative term, such as ISIS mobile banking app becoming Softcard; or a dated symbol, as with American Telephone & Telegraph becoming primarily known as AT&T.

"law's expansions over recent decades have deepened that difference and worked primarily to benefit the famous brands. 453 Amazon's practices seem likely to shift the balance even more radically in favor of certain well-known brands, and especially Amazon's own brands. It is notable here that the truly rarified luxury brands are largely unaffected by the changes we have described. Those brands have never really trafficked in the informational function of brands, at least not in the sense of information about the tangible characteristics of those products, which is the kind of information that might be replaced by algorithms and consumer reviews. Instead, they have primarily benefited from their aura. 454 Perhaps unsurprisingly, those brands do not sell on Amazon. They sell through their own stores and a highly curated group of retailers. 455",body_text,text,0.8697001034126164,200,963,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"In the longer term, it remains to be seen whether any countermoves are available to brands that might shift the balance back in their direction. Perhaps one countermove is more use of direct-to-consumer approaches via other platforms, especially social media. 456 Such moves might ultimately affect a shift from product-based competition to platform-based competition, and the competitive effects of a platform-based model will depend on its overall value. 457",body_text,text,0.9934924078091106,201,964,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Amazon's market dominance has frequently drawn the attention of scholars and regulators. But one aspect of its dominance has mostly escaped their attention: the impact of Amazon's policies, and especially its Brand Registry, on the U.S. trademark system. Because sellers need to be on Amazon, and because being a part of the Brand Registry provides them with enforcement benefits and preferential treatment in search results, those sellers have substantially increased incentives to apply to register their marks. But, because an application to register is the ticket to inclusion in the Brand Registry, many small businesses that previously would have relied on unregistered rights now feel compelled to register. The result has been an explosion in the number of applications and a growing backlog at the PTO, leading to longer pendency for all applications. Amazon's policies have also affected the content of those applications. Sellers on Amazon have stronger motivation to claim descriptive and generic terms, especially in stylized format or with accompanying images, and to game the",body_text,text,0.9002070393374741,202,966,california_law_review_amazon-trademark

"These effects may not have been intended by Amazon, but as our data show, they have had a profound impact on trademark registration practice. Some of the effects are problematic from a trademark perspective, and there are broader ruleof-law concerns about the fact that a single company's policies can so dramatically change the legal landscape.",body_text,text,0.9898697539797395,203,973,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
"Amazon does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. As the platform keeps pushing its Brand Registry, sellers will continue to find reasons to participate in the program to protect their marks and remain competitive. While the full consequences of these practices are yet to be seen, as this Article shows, Amazon affects much more than the sellers on its platform: It is starting to reshape the normative and structural underpinnings of the U.S. trademark system. In the end, whether and how we respond to these profound effects on the trademark system depends on the extent to which we consider Amazon's overhaul troublesome for the goals that drive our trademark system.",body_text,text,0.9985185185185185,205,975,california_law_review_amazon-trademark
