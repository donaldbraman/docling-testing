"The Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College ( SFFA ) majority opinion has been widely misunderstood as a victory for those who believe in the 'colorblind Constitution.' By juxtaposing the opinion's main rule with the exception for admitting students based on essays that discuss students' lived experiences with race, I reveal the opinion's fundamental incoherence, as well as its furtive race-consciousness. The majority opinion asserted that equal protection requires that a student's race may never be used as a 'negative,' policies may not 'stereotype' students based on race, and policies must have a fixed endpoint. Yet the Court's exception for race-based essays violates each of these requirements. Rather than banish race from admissions decisions, the opinion merely channels race consciousness into the consideration of essays. This examination reveals the chasm between colorblind rhetoric-engaged in by conservatives and liberals-and the inescapability of racially-forged realities. This matters because conservative lawyers and funders are brandishing SFFA as a complete victory for colorblindness and the touchstone of a national movement to eliminate anti-racist policies.",body_text,text,0.9411764705882353,0,2,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

"The Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College ( SFFA ) 1 has been misunderstood as a victory for those who believe in the 'colorblind Constitution.' The Justices in the majority and in the dissent strongly debated the value of a 'colorblind' conception of the Equal Protection Clause. Chief Justice Roberts argued that his majority opinion enforced what he called Brown v. Board of Education 's 2 commitment to colorblindness. 3 Justice Thomas contended that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended it to require colorblindness. 4 Roberts, Thomas, and the dissenters laid claim to Justice Harlan's famous dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson , although they construed it differently. 5 Thomas quoted Harlan extensively, including his claim that '[o]ur Constitution is color-blind.' 6 In dissent, Justice Sotomayor castigated the Court for 'cement[ing] a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.' 7 And Justice Jackson's dissent seethed: 'With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat.' 8",body_text,text,0.9497607655502392,2,8,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

"This emphasis on colorblindness threatens to mislead readers, including lower courts and students applying to college. The colorblindness debate obscures a gap between rhetoric and reality. At the tail end of the majority opinion, the Court authorized race consciousness, even as it claimed to vindicate colorblindness.

"Instead of banishing race-consciousness, SFFA merely relocates it; now it may occur only in the context of considering an applicant's personal essay, rather than the applicant's entire admissions file. Also, admissions officers may not consult the racial demographics of admitted students while considering individual applications. Under this new regime, students will exercise more agency-and bear more burden-in that their decision whether or not to write about race may be pivotal. The media coverage touting the death of affirmative action threatens to misguide students of color. 43 Some students may think avoiding race is the smartest strategy in this new, 'colorblind' landscape.

After its remark about measurability, Fisher went on to say that 'the University articulated concrete and precise goals.' 62 The goals of the Harvard and UNC policies strongly resembled the goals of the University of Texas policy in Fisher . Roberts's citation is sleight of hand. It gives the impression that Roberts is enforcing Fisher while he is actually reversing its finding that diversity is a compelling governmental interest.

"Unlike the Grutter and Fisher majorities, Roberts went on to suggest that racial categories are as 'elusive' 64 and ambiguous as the universities' asserted pedagogical interests. He argued that the racial categories utilized by the universities-'(1) Asian; (2) Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; (3) Hispanic; (4) White; (5) African-American; and (6) Native American'-are 'opaque,' 65 'imprecise in many ways,' 'plainly overbroad,' and 'arbitrary or undefined.' 66 Roberts first emphasized the 'Asian' category. '[B]y grouping together all Asian students, for instance, respondents are apparently uninterested in whether South Asian or East Asian students are adequately represented, so long as there is enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other.' 67 Roberts offered no support for his intuition that South Asian and East Asian do not belong in the same category. He also provided no citation for the claim that universities do not care if one of those subgroups is underrepresented. There is a squishy quality to Roberts's critiques of racial categories. He repeatedly assumed that universities do not care about subgroups without citing any statements from admissions policies, the universities' briefs, or oral arguments that actually said that. 68 Moreover, the upshot of Roberts's critiques of the universities' racial categories",body_text,text,0.8756793478260869,20,105,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

"Roberts's second 'command,' which forbids racial stereotyping, 74 resonates with a general concern expressed in various opinions. 75 As he did with Fisher , Roberts appropriated a quote from Grutter while concealing its relevant context: 'We have long held that universities may not operate their admissions programs on the 'belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.'' 76 The Grutter majority opinion directly refuted the notion that Harvard-style policies promote the view that minorities express a singular viewpoint. After referring to the claim that the university assumed 'that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue,' O'Connor disavowed it. 77 'To the contrary,' she asserted, 'diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.' 78 Grutter held that 'the Law School's admissions policy promotes 'cross-racial understanding,' helps to break down racial stereotypes , and 'enables [students] to better understand persons of different races.'' 79 These benefits, it concluded, are 'substantial.' 80 Thus, Roberts revived an argument about 'stereotyping' that Grutter had rejected. 81 The universities in SFFA , like the University of Michigan in Grutter , had argued that the diversity rationale combats stereotypes, rather than perpetuating them.

Starr, supra note 14 (manuscript at 12); see also id. (manuscript at 15) (stating that the 'essay carveout fits well with other key components of the [ SFFA ] majority's logic'). Starr argues that 'when race is relevant to understanding how a specific individual developed specific traits that are relevant to a university's valid nonracial objectives[,]' considering race is not stereotyping. Id. (manuscript at 12-13) ('But when an admissions officer considers a particular applicant's life experiences, it does not need to categorize groups at all.'). In my view, this explanation does not work. First, as Benjamin Eidelson has argued, insofar as a person identifies with or is treated as a member of a group, respect for individual experience may require treating them as a member of a group. See Benjamin Eidelson, Respect, Individualism, and Colorblindness , 129 Y ALE L.J. 1600, 1674 (2020) ('[R]efusing to consider race often means refusing to treat people respectfully as individuals, because it means ignoring a factor that illuminates the significance of their choices and experiences.

"Second, a reader of a student essay will unconsciously draw on background knowledge of common racial group experiences to make sense of the essay. See Eidelson & Hellman, supra note 17, at 322 ('[A]pplicants who identify themselves by race will be trading on the reader's sense, not the applicant's own, of the relevance of the facts that the applicant conveys.'). For example, imagine that a Chinese American woman writes a personal essay that says she was racially profiled while driving and subjected to excessive force. A reader may struggle to understand and give weight to this statement because of background assumptions that Black people, and especially Black men (who are often stereotyped as hypermasculine), are typically vulnerable to racial profiling while driving, not Asian American women (who are often stereotyped as hyperfeminine). The reader's assumptions about different racial or gender groups and their typical experiences will inform how they make sense of the student's narrative. See Kohler-Hausmann, supra note 101, at 335. Stories that resonate with general understandings of racialized experiences will be easier to digest than those that diverge from them.

Moreover, if Roberts truly believes that race generally does not matter in the world, then he should have looked askance at students who write about experiences of racial discrimination. If race generally does not matter in life, and asserted differences between Black and White students are illusory, 109 shouldn't colleges assume that Black students who invoke race are 'playing the race card'? 110 Roberts implicitly rejected these arguments and thus accepted that student descriptions of how race has forged their lives are normally credible, do not inflict 'hurt and injury,' 111 and may legitimately serve as the basis of their admission.",body_text,text,0.9587109768378651,32,169,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

In that sense, the essay exception is facially neutral. It does not contain a racial classification. Perhaps that is what Roberts meant by denying that admitting students based on their essays is admitting them 'on the basis of race.' 117 But the same was said of the admissions policies approved in Grutter and Bakke : White students too could display their 'diversity.' As a practical matter, moreover, we know that White people are less likely to regard their race as a significant part of their identities and less likely to report racial discrimination. 118 Black people, surveys suggest, are the most likely to report that they have been subjected to racial discrimination and Latine and Asian American reports of racial discrimination tend to fall in between those of Black people and White people.

This Part provides the rationale for considering race-based essays, which is absent from the SFFA opinions.

"Considering this skepticism, particularly among conservative White Americans, the SFFA majority opinion's willingness to accept student narratives of racial discrimination at face value is rather striking. Could it be that some Justices understood the inequality of banning racial narratives, even though such a ban would not take the shape of a racial classification? Perhaps at some level, Roberts and those who joined his opinion could not deny that race matters in students' experiences, and forbidding students from expressing that would be discrimination. If so, that would be a notable expansion of equal protection doctrine in two respects. First, for all of Roberts's efforts to deny that race matters, it would suggest that at some level he acquiesced to the dissenters. The main theme of the dissenting opinions was surely race matters . 168 Perhaps there was some implicit common ground between the majority and the dissenters. Second, it would constitute a rare judicial acknowledgement of racial harm experienced by people of color in the absence of a racial classification. 169 This is less meaningful as precedent of course because the Court provided no rationale for the essay exception. 170 Nonetheless, the essay exception, in combination with the majority's suggestion of a military exception, 171 and validation of raceconsciousness in a contemporaneous voting rights case 172 refute the notion that the Equal Protection Clause imposes 'colorblindness for all.' 173 Given that the Court failed to provide any principles for exempting essays and the military from a presumption of 'colorblindness,' it will initially fall to lower courts to draw lines between contexts when race-consciousness is and is not permissible.",body_text,text,0.9896670493685419,58,269,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

SFFA's first claim pitted Asian Americans against White applicants, while the second claim asserted that the two groups shared a disadvantage vis-à-vis Black, Latine, and Indigenous applicants. Roberts's divergent treatment of SFFA's distinctive claims of racial discrimination further undercut his valorization of 'colorblindness.' As explained by the First Circuit, SFFA's lawsuit challenged two different aspects of Harvard's admissions policy: (1) Harvard's reliance on a 'personal rating' stereotyped the personalities of Asian American applicants and thus reduced their odds of admission; 174 and (2) Harvard's granting of a 'plus' to URM students for diversity illegally conferred a 'negative' on Asian American and White applicants. 175 The Supreme Court majority endorsed the rhetoric of anti-Asian bias during oral argument and in opinions by conservative Justices. But the majority ultimately failed to rule on SFFA's challenge to the personal rating and even declined to explain this move. The Court granted Asian American applicants relief only insofar as their interests aligned with White applicants. The Court simply ignored SFFA's argument that White applicants received an unfair advantage because they were said to be more personable.

"The concurring opinions were more attentive to the plight of Asian Americans, although this concern was merely rhetorical. Thomas provided a brief description of anti-Asian discrimination in U.S. history, including Supreme Court decisions that upheld that racism. 192 His summary, however, omitted any critique of Harlan, whom he held up as the pioneer of the 'colorblind Constitution.' As discussed in the introduction, Harlan's opinions depicted Chinese people as perpetual foreigners unworthy of citizenship. 193 Thomas stressed that 'Asian Americans can hardly be described as the beneficiaries of historical racial advantages.' 194 Moreover, '[g]iven the history of discrimination against Asian Americans, especially their history with segregated schools, it seems particularly incongruous to suggest that a past history of segregationist policies toward blacks should be remedied at the expense of Asian American college applicants.' 195 Thomas then quickly pivoted to extend Asian Americans' moral capital to White applicants: 'But this problem is not limited to Asian Americans; more broadly, universities' discriminatory policies burden millions of applicants who are not responsible for the racial discrimination that sullied our Nation's past.' 196 In other words, White college applicants bear no more responsibility than Asian Americans for the country's racist legacy. 197 Even though White applicants lacked a history of enduring victimhood comparable to that experienced by Asian Americans, they got to share in the glow of racial innocence.

At oral argument, Roberts and Gorsuch asserted that the real victims of discrimination were Asian Americans, 204 yet the majority opinion protected Asian Americans only insofar as their interests converged with White applicants.

First, the claim of 'negative action' against Asian Americans went from central to marginal in the briefing. Second, while SFFA initially argued for what it called complete colorblindness in admissions, it ultimately agreed that universities could consider racial experiences discussed in student essays.

"This Essay has sought to make visible how colorblindness rhetoric may mask race-conscious realities. The Court's ruling in SFFA does not install colorblindness across the board. 207 To the contrary, it creates a veneer of colorblindness that masks the approval of race conscious admissions. It encourages students to write race-conscious essays and permits universities to admit students based on their lived experiences with race. This means that Grutter 's authorization of race-conscious individualized consideration lives on in the context of essays. 208 As Jonathan Feingold has suggested, 'colorblindness' should be understood as a heuristic that conceals multiple assumptions about whether race does and should matter in law and society. 209 Accordingly, I urge judges and scholars to unpack and deconstruct assertions of colorblindness. Close scrutiny reveals that claims about 'colorblindness,' 'preferences,' 'race neutrality,' and 'merit' often turn on a fictional baseline in which race does not matter. 210 Race has always mattered in America, and the 2024 election suggests that it will continue to do so at least for our lifetimes. When liberals acquiesce to colorblind discourses, they ignore racially-forged realities and cede the moral high ground. 211",body_text,text,0.9638364779874213,67,324,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

First, although the Court declined to endorse the diversity rationale, it described diversity as 'plainly worthy,' 213 which suggests that universities may continue to pursue it. 214 They may not use racial classifications or consult racial demographics. But this rule would seem to leave universities ample discretion to use 'race neutral' policies to advance diversity, following in the footsteps of the University of California, which has doggedly worked to recover from Proposition 209's ban on affirmative action in the 1990s. 215 After California voters approved Proposition 209, it was unclear whether universities could consider student essays that discussed race, or whether such students should be treated as lawbreakers. 216 The SFFA Court's unanimous endorsement of admitting students based on essays resolves doubts about the legality of this practice.",body_text,text,0.9756345177664975,69,332,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution

"The SFFA Court set few boundaries on university use of student essays. One benefit of this new regime is that students will exercise more autonomy in deciding whether and how to discuss race in their essays. At the same time, the Court's colorblind rhetoric and overblown claims of the death of affirmative action may deter students from engaging race. This regime places new burdens on students and admissions officers to work through these questions. But given the Court's blinkered awareness of race, leaving these questions to students and universities would be better for society. The impact of SFFA may ultimately depend on the individual and collective action of students and universities-both of which are often vilified by 'anti-woke' advocates for their progressive racial politics. 220 The heightened awareness of race and racism after the racial uprising of 2020, particularly as it has infused students and university administrations, might matter more than the colorblind rhetoric of the SFFA majority.",body_text,text,0.9542547958681751,71,341,california_law_review_incoherence-colorblind-constitution
