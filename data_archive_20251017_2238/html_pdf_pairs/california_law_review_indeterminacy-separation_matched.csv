"The two dominant schools of thought about the separation of powersformalism and functionalism 1 -are both committed to a tripartite system under which the judicial branch enjoys a privileged position in the development of constitutional rules. To that end, both think that the Constitution distributes powers among three coequal branches and the states, 2 that some powers are enumerated and others implied, that the separation of powers operates as a restraint on government overreach, and that the judiciary should arbitrate separation-of-powers disputes. Disagreement is primarily about specifics: How many powers does the Constitution imply? What are they? Does the Constitution blend or mix powers among the branches? And what historical moments are relevant in discerning the limits of congressional and presidential power?",body_text,text,0.9939759036144579,2,8,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation
"Historically, however, the United States has entertained, and sometimes embraced, separation-of-powers theories that reject many of the premises about which modern formalists and functionalists agree. Consider, for example, nineteenth-century debates about the President's authority to remove civil service officials. Snippets of this long constitutional contest have become canonical moments in the debate about the President's authority to remove administrative officials. But the removal issue has not always been framed as being about the President's relationship to Congress. During the nineteenth century, arguments about the President's authority to fire members of the civil service were often based on policymakers' views about political science, 3 by",body_text,text,0.8203167667941016,3,9,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"We describe four alternative approaches to resolving interdepartmental disputes. 4 First, some members of the founding generation embraced an Antidomination theory about legislative and executive powers. 5 This theory denied that the terms 'executive' or 'legislative' implied justiciable limits on government authority, at least beyond certain specifically enumerated powers. It instead stipulated processes by which the legislative and executive branches could enact legally binding policies: Legislation must be enacted through bicameralism and presentment, and the President must act via express statutory or constitutional authorization. The constitutionally relevant fact was that each branch respected the Constitution's procedural constraints. To be sure, other structural theories travelled alongside this view, but for some early interpreters of the Constitution, the drafters' political theory focused on the document's procedural checks as the 'practical' elaboration of the core idea, not on metaphysical appeals to the concept of 'executive,' 'legislative,' or 'judicial.' 6",body_text,text,0.9554841670491051,4,14,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation
"Second, a rights-based 'Public Utility' theory reflected a libertarian commitment to protecting a sphere of private conduct. Courts used the distinction between public rights and public enterprises, on the one hand, and private rights and private enterprises, on the other, to ground the constitutionality of agency deference, adjudication, and rulemaking. Many of today's separationof-powers concerns were therefore subsumed under the question of the publicity of the actor subject to regulatory oversight. This reasoning is typically associated with the Lochner era and, to our knowledge, has not been understood as a theory of interbranch relations. 7 Yet, in providing the decisive test to determine when government could control private conduct, the Public Utility idea also came to settle interbranch disputes about legislatures', agencies', and courts' roles in regulating economic activity.",body_text,text,0.9532814238042269,5,15,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"Third, under a Political theory approach, superordinate moral values transcended any individual sovereign order and could be codified as constitutional principles by enlightened judges. This approach has come to be known as the General Law and is, somewhat ironically, now associated with modern positive law theorists. 8 In reality, this mode of constitutional interpretation blended reason, custom, and religion. 9 Judges reasoned their way to the correct scientific constitutional theory based on a body of general and universally applicable rules that often appealed to anachronistic understandings of divine providence. 10",body_text,text,0.9928400954653938,6,20,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation
"Fourth, a Social Science theory discerned constitutional limits through technocratic and economic reasoning. In this view, the meaning of the Constitution changed based on evolving practical considerations. For example, within a four-decade period in the nineteenth century, concern about the effectiveness of the civil service was used to justify both presidential removal of civil servants and Congress's role in regulating removal. Initially, corruption in the civil service justified heightened removal powers and a rotation-in-office system. 11 Then, a decade later, concern about the government's inability to retain expert administrators caused the tide to shift toward more robust removal protections. 12 These were thought not to reflect incompatible theories of the executive power, but rather an understanding that constitutional principles should evolve with changing economic and political circumstances. 13 Cases from this fourth category have been marshaled to support different theories of departmental limits, many of which have continued relevance in modern formalist and functionalist debates. However, this category was based on a wholly different constitutional cast of mind: one in which structural limitations followed from a political-scientific inquiry that could be answered through both philosophical reasoning and political empirics.",body_text,text,0.9952293577981651,7,21,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"Last term, in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , 18 the Supreme Court cited the public utility case Saint Joseph Stock Yards v. United States to argue that judicial deference to agency legal determinations violates the separation of powers. 19 The Court used Saint Joseph to suggest that agencies have discretion to make findings of fact but not of law. Yet the Saint Joseph Court was not concerned that a nonlegislative actor exercised legislative power or that a nonjudicial actor exercised judicial power, at least not in the modern sense. It was instead considering when deference to administrative agencies interfered with individual property protections. 20 Though courts are now relying on century-old deference cases to reinvigorate a formalist separation of powers, these cases were originally about administrative discretion to regulate public utilities. 21",body_text,list_item,0.9908466819221968,10,33,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"There exists no conflict-of-law principle for deciding among competing separation-of-powers theories, especially when courts draw from conflicting theoretical frameworks to resolve modern separation-of-powers controversies. Different theories have risen and fallen, but no one theory has been fixed or liquidated through custom or historical practice. 27 Indeed, the same styles of legal reasoning-arguments based on text and structure and history-have supported different constitutional theories. The General Law theory, for example, expressly subordinates questions about ambiguous constitutional terms in order to consult customary practices that reflect exogenous patterns of our political, electoral, and economic lives. The persistence of pluralism in separation-of-powers debates does not suggest that constitutional theory is a confused muddle that cannot be resolved, but rather that the Constitution's indeterminacy leaves apparent separation-of-powers settlements open to reinterpretation and reinvention. 28",body_text,text,0.9941176470588236,14,47,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"Consider, for example, the nondelegation doctrine, which posits that Congress cannot delegate broad rulemaking authority to administrative agencies. 33 The Constitution assigns legislative power to Congress. 34 According to proponents of the nondelegation doctrine, the legislative power includes the power to enact prospective rules of general applicability. 35 By definition, agency rulemaking consists of rules of general applicability. It therefore violates a formalist separation of powers, since it involves the exercise of legislative power by a non-legislative actor. 36 The same mode of reasoning applies to the President's authority to remove administrative officials. Article II vests executive powers in the President. 37 According to formalists, that grant conveys exclusive authority to supervise executive departments and thus carries with it the power to appoint and remove personnel. 38 While the appointment power is formally shared with Congress, the Constitution's silence about removal suggests that the residual power must be the President's alone. Accordingly, when Congress imposes restrictions on the President's authority to remove administrative officials, it interferes with the President's power to execute the law. 39",body_text,text,0.9876049580167933,19,65,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

On this view, the Madisonian axiom that 'ambition must be made to counteract ambition' is intended to limit government: Each branch's pursuit of power will induce the other branches to restrain it. 50 At other times, the separation of powers has been justified for promoting reasoned deliberation and requiring compromise between competing geographic and political interests.",body_text,text,0.9322152341020266,25,91,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

Indeed, Antidomination accepts that there are only three branches of government, that formal distinctions separate the three branches, and that it is unconstitutional to mix or blend different powers. For example, Congress possesses impeachment and appropriations powers; the President possesses the commander-in-chief power; and the judiciary possesses the power to decide cases or controversies arising under the Constitution. 72 It would violate the separation of powers for impeachment to occur outside the process defined in Article I, for the judiciary to appropriate funds for a new courthouse, for the Senate to instruct the Navy to launch missiles at a foreign adversary, or for the President to issue a judgment in a pending judicial proceeding.

"Thus, the reason Antidomination can accommodate legislative grants of rulemaking authority is that most such delegations preserve the relevant distinctions between each branch's checking powers.

So long as Congress (1) follows the procedures enumerated in the Constitution, and (2) respects specific allocative grants in the Constitution's text, no other formal constraint is breached. Conversely, agency rulemaking is not a 'quasi-legislative' act.

The underlying question was whether a statute granting an agency ratemaking authority 'confers both legislative and judicial powers on the commission, and is thus repugnant to the [C]onstitution.' 131 The Court dismissed this argument, which resembles modern nondelegation and Article III challenges, in a few brief sentences, explaining that 'the only limit on the power of the commissioners is the constitutional authority of the state over the subject.' 132",body_text,text,0.9890430971512053,77,243,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

"the 'arbitrary eclecticism' 197 that characterized international law in the late nineteenth century. International lawyers came to espouse 'positivism' regarding how international law is made, and by the early twentieth century, it was fashionable to trace the authoritativeness of international law to the voluntary consent of states. 198 In this moment of jurisprudential taste-changing, international lawyers were critiqued for 'appear[ing] to pick and choose from natural and positive law exactly as they think fit.' 199 What results, the midcentury critique continued, was a practice of international lawyering consisting of '[m]utual quotation clubs and . . .

"Notably, midcentury critics of the general law did not abandon the idea of a customary law altogether. Some instead embraced an inductive approach to customary international law: Custom is derived from systematically observing state practice and other states' acquiescence to that practice-and only those things. 201 They rejected natural law and other deductive forms of reasoning as producing the 'uneasy feeling that . . . [one's] august teacher is producing a beautiful spiral in the air, coming from nowhere and disappearing in the clouds.' 202 These critics felt that the deductive approach suffered from arbitrary eclecticism and argued that international law should become entirely 'inductive,' by which they meant that international law should be determined entirely by observing the voluntary behavior and agreements of states. These accounts of international law emphasize the probative nature of states' own statements in determining the content of the law, and they search for evidence that states believe that their actions are obliged by law before pronouncing that a given rule has become customary international law. 203",body_text,text,0.9890206411945542,110,356,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation

Additionally, both face the problem of non liquet -how to identify, and what to do, when evidence of practice runs out; 207 and both face the objection that since customary norms do not harden into law until a sufficient group believes they have become law, legal claims about custom can have a circular quality about them. 208",body_text,text,0.9690812720848057,112,366,california_law_review_indeterminacy-separation
