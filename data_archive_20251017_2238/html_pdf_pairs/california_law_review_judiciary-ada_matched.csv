"For over thirty years, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been the main federal protection against discrimination for disabled people. Although ADA protections are ensured in the federal legislative branch and in state courthouses, this pivotal disability rights statute does not cover the federal judiciary. ADA claims are consequently litigated in federal courthouses that may be inaccessible to disabled people, yet there is little scholarship on the topic. This Note aims to fill this gap by exploring the implications of the lack of accessibility in the federal judiciary. Without ADA protections, disabled people do not have recourse when faced with discrimination and inaccessible spaces. This lack of protection threatens disabled people's access to justice, access to the workplace, and representation both on juries and within the federal judiciary. This Note consequently argues that the federal judiciary should adopt ADA protections to provide equal access to the federal court system and ensure that the federal judiciary reflects the diverse public it serves. It is time to have an informed conversation with all relevant constituencies about applying ADA protections to the federal judiciary.",body_text,text,0.9991796554552912,0,2,california_law_review_judiciary-ada

A wheelchair user, Lane had no choice but to attempt to crawl up two flights of stairs to appear in court. 1 As he struggled, the judge and other courthouse employees stood by and laughed. 2 When Lane refused to go through the demoralizing and painful experience of crawling up the stairs again after the court took a lunch break, he was arrested and jailed for failing to appear. 3",body_text,text,0.9924686192468619,2,8,california_law_review_judiciary-ada

However, the restrooms in the courthouse may remain inaccessible if they have not been altered since 1968. 44 Further, the Architectural Barriers Act also does not provide a private right of action for violations, so would-be plaintiffs cannot sue to force the courts to give them access.
