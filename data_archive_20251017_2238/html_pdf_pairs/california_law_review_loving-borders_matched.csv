"In a term filled with high-profile cases, Department of State v. Muñoz 1 did not receive high-profile treatment. But the case was a critically important successor to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. 2 In Muñoz, the Court continued efforts, launched in Dobbs, to shrink the protective force of the Due Process Clause. Even more significantly, in Muñoz, the Court launched another attack on the equality principle undergirding Loving v. Virginia, 3 Lawrence v. Texas, 4 United States v. Windsor, 5 and Obergefell v. Hodges. 6 Those cases embodied what Laurence Tribe once dubbed a 'double helix' of due process and equal protection principles. 7 They show the Court's effort (albeit imperfect) to weave together liberty guarantees and equality principles to better protect human dignity. 8 Muñoz made clear that the Court's post -Dobbs reordering of constitutional principles is taking direct aim at both strands of the double helix. Through its rejection of substantive due process protections, the Court is intentionally weakening a broad swath of antidiscrimination protections and procedural due process rights.",body_text,text,0.9791943337760071,0,2,california_law_review_loving-borders

"This Essay explores the implications of the Muñoz decision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The Court took an unnecessarily maximalist approach in Muñoz, undermining the practical value of the right to marriage for individuals married to noncitizens. Part II argues that the Court did so through one of its frequently used moves: namely, denying rights protections to a U.S. resident (here, a citizen by birth and resident of California) through a sleight of hand that r educed Muñoz's constitutional rights and interests to those of a constitutional 'outsider.' 9 This aspect of the case foreshadows the continued erosion of constitutional protections for the members of historically subordinated groups. Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades of constitutional case law by denying courts a role in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court's substantive due process analysis in Muñoz. 10 Invidious discrimination drove, and was manifested in, the Court's reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent. Part V critiques the historical errors of the Court's purportedly originalist account and its selected level of generality. The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications of Muñoz for the Constitution's promise of equal protection. Muñoz 's limited reading of the 'right to marriage' obviously shrinks the protective scope of the Constitution's due process protections. But in so doing, it also legitimates familiar patterns of subordination along lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, and citizenship.",body_text,text,0.9278650378126818,1,13,california_law_review_loving-borders

"Sandra Muñoz, a U.S. citizen by birth, a workers' rights lawyer, and a resident of Los Angeles, 11 filed a lawsuit when her husband, Luis AsencioCordero, was denied entry into the United States after he traveled to El Salvador. 12 Prior to his trip to El Salvador, Asencio-Cordero had been residing in the United States without documentation. 13 Several years after his marriage to Muñoz made him eligible for a family-based immigrant visa, he applied for his visa. Because the law required him to travel to El Salvador to process his visa, 14 Asencio-Cordero also applied for and received from the Department of Homeland Security a waiver of the unlawful presence bar that would otherwise have prevented him from returning to the United States for ten years. 15 Armed with that waiver, he left the United States to complete his visa application process in El Salvador. 16 Unfortunately, when he then sought to return to the United States, the State Department's consular officials working in the embassy in El Salvador denied his visa application. 17 In justifying the visa denial, the government offered no formal explanation beyond a citation to a statutory provision: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision bars the admission of a noncitizen whom the officer 'knows, or has reasonable ground to be lieve, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in' certain specified offenses or 'any other unlawful activity.' 18",body_text,text,0.965893587994543,3,18,california_law_review_loving-borders

The statutes do establish that Congress has passed laws at various points in time that have excluded some citizens' noncitizen spouses, just as Congress has passed laws limiting gun ownership and prohibiting certain forms of speech and association.

In Mandel , U.S. citizen faculty members challenged a State Department decision to exclude, without explanation, a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician that the U.S. professors sought to bring to the United States for debate and discussion. 56 While the Court in Mandel reiterated its mid-twentieth-century conclusion that noncitizens outside the United States had no legal basis upon which to challenge their exclusion, 57 the Court also recognized that the U.S. professors' 'First Amendment rights [were] implicated' 58 by Mandel's exclusion because they had a First Amendment right to hear Mandel speak. Thus, the Court recognized that the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens were implicated even if noncitizens did not have a legal basis to challenge the visa denial. Nonetheless, the Court found that those interests were outweighed in the case at hand because the government had provided a 'facially legitimate and bona fide reason' for Mandel's exclusion. 59 Given the supposed national security implications inhering in the government's decision to admit a noncitizen, the Court was not willing to look further behind the government's explanation.",body_text,text,0.9883959044368601,21,90,california_law_review_loving-borders

"Scholars before and after Yoshino have recognized and analyzed the interplay between liberty and equality in the Court's substantive due process decisions in Loving , 100 Roe , 101 Lawrence , 102 and beyond. In particular, scholars who had made the case for abortion rights as an equality concern have long noted the interplay of liberty and equality protections at issue in the Court's abortion rights analysis. 103 Several opinions of the Court in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey also reflect this notion. 104 More recently, in analyzing the Obergefell marriage equality decision, Laurence Tribe argued that ' Obergefell 's chief jurisprudential achievement is to have tightly wound the double helix of Due Process and Equal Protection into a doctrine of equal dignity -and to have located that doctrine in a tradition of constitutional interpretation as an exercise in public education.' 105 Both Yoshino and Tribe saw Obergefell 's equal dignity principle as replacing the substantive due process classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State ' s citizens of liberty without due process of law.

"Muñoz made clear that the current Court intends to treat the emergence of constitutional notions of equal dignity as a jurisprudential blip. The Muñoz decision gave pride of place to the approach in Glucksberg that defines the claimed right at a very high level of specificity, 107 rejecting Muñoz's fundamental rights claim through its narrow application of a history and tradition test founded upon a highly selective historical narrative. 108 In cases like Lawrence , and most certainly in Obergefell , the Court was able to affirm substantive due process protections by setting a generous level of generality when defining the right in question. The level of generality at which the Court evaluated the right was key to the Court's affirmation of substanti ve due process protection for the liberty of one consenting adult to engage in sexual activity with another. 109 The same was true of the Court's decision recognizing the constitutional protection of same-sex marriage. 110 The majority opinion in Muñoz seemingly closed the door on the capacious substantive due process analysis of these earlier cases. 111 And in failing to recognize that the facts of the case implicated any legal protections whatsoever for Muñoz's marriage, the Court went even further, threatening every meaningful substantive and procedural protection that might otherwise have been thought to inhere in the marriage right.",body_text,text,0.9907604832977968,37,175,california_law_review_loving-borders

"The Muñoz majority opinion does not revisit the Court's previous marriage cases, but the revivified Glucksberg analysis in Muñoz raises some questions about their continued robustness. Muñoz portends a 'right to marriage' with little substantive content and a hard national border that affords no rights to those whose associational ties span it. The Court's decision in Muñoz illustrates how shifts in its doctrinal analysis threaten both the liberty and equality values embodied in the line of cases that only very recently began to provide constitutional protections for the marriages and intimate associations of all the nation's people, including those most politically vulnerable.",body_text,text,0.967930029154519,40,186,california_law_review_loving-borders
