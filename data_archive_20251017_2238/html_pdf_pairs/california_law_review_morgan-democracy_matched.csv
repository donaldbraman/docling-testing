"California has a housing crisis. Despite the state government's best efforts to build more homes, local governments and local voters are finding new ways to circumvent those requirements. One such loophole allows California voters to propose non-compliant housing plans through the ballot initiative process or effectively veto their local governments' housing allocation decisions through a referendum. Although voters rarely use this loophole, the California Supreme Court should step in and prevent it from growing in popularity. The court can do so by simply making a small change to a legal test that determines when local initiatives and referenda are preempted by state law.",body_text,text,0.9970631424375918,0,3,california_law_review_morgan-democracy

"Fortunately, such a change in the doctrine is possible.

In essence, this means that the court should (1) look for a statewide concern and (2) consider the size and scope of the state regulation. This is not a particularly novel approach: The late California Supreme Court Justice Armand Arabian contemplated a more expansive exclusive delegation test while dissenting in DeVita v.

"Understanding the history of the preemption doctrine is important to understanding the current iteration of the preemption test. 44 The California Supreme Court originally barred the use of the local initiative and referendum to override municipal action only if the municipality's acts were 'legislative in character' as opposed to 'executive or administrative.' 45 The quintessential administrative versus legislative case, Simpson v. Hite , illustrates this concept. 46 In Simpson , the relevant state law required county boards of supervisors to provide 'suitable quarters' for local courts. 47 Although the State set that overarching policy, the law gave boards of supervisors discretion to determine 'what is required to constitute 'suitable quarters.'' 48 In Los Angeles, the Board of Supervisors set a location for a courthouse, the planning commission affirmed it, and the county solicited bids. 49 At that point, disgruntled citizens started circulating an initiative petition to force the County to choose a different site for the courthouse. 50 The California Supreme Court removed the initiative from the ballot and held that the Board of Supervisors was acting as an administrative agent of the state. 51 The State had 'acted to establish the basic policy' of creating suitable quarters for courthouses across the state and had 'vested the responsibility for carrying out that policy' with the county boards of supervisors. 52 Thus, despite holding legislative power, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors was performing an administrative function 'specifically imposed by the state.' 53 The court deemed this function beyond the scope of the people's initiative power. 54",body_text,text,0.9556213017751479,12,72,california_law_review_morgan-democracy

The court in COST derided the administrative-legislative distinction as 'an unnecessary fiction' and replaced it with the exclusive delegation factors. 74 Now, the COST factors are situated alongside the administrative-legislative inquiry as equal partners in determining legislative intent. 75 Furthermore, this new test overemphasizes statewide concern by double counting it: once in the first prong and again in the second prong's showing of exclusive delegation. 76 The COST factors and the administrative-legislative test were never meant to coexist, and yet that is what the City of Morgan Hill test does.

Passed by a small majority of voters, Proposition A soon came into conflict with state housing laws. 98 The City of Encinitas, as required by the RHNA allocation process, attempted to update its housing element in 2016 and again in 2018, and both times voters rejected those measures in elections prescribed by Proposition A. 99 After several years of stalemate, a court suspended Proposition A to allow the City of Encinitas to enact a valid housing",body_text,text,0.9041517170681702,23,137,california_law_review_morgan-democracy

"There is precedent for Justice Arabian's dissent. In Simpson v.

Hite was couched in the administrative-legislative test, its justification for holding that the courthouse location could not be subject to the local initiative power was all about procedural inconsistencies. 125 Justice Arabian's dissent in DeVita is consistent with this understanding of the preemption power. 126",body_text,text,0.9846547314578005,29,182,california_law_review_morgan-democracy

"Adding Justice Arabian's process-based analysis supports this conclusion. The statewide RHNA process is plainly incompatible with the exercise of local direct democracy powers. From the outset, the entire RHNA process takes two years to complete: HCD tells the COGs how much housing they need to plan for two years before the housing elements are due, and the COGs are required to tell local governments their respective allocations no later than a year before the housing elements are due. 139 This allows at most a year for an initiative to pass and even less for a referendum to reject a proposed housing element. The initiative process takes significant time: an unspecified amount of time to prepare the petition, 15 days after submission to receive a title and summary from the city attorney, 140 no more than 180 days to collect signatures, 141 and an additional 30 days (excluding weekends and holidays) for the local elections official to certify that the petition had sufficient signatures. 142 In sum, that is 225 days just to get a viable petition. From there, the city council has 10 days to adopt the petition, order a report (which could add 30 more days), or submit the petition to a vote. 143 That is a maximum of 265 days after the petition was submitted before voters even get a look at the initiative. 144 It is hard to reconcile the time required to submit a petition to vote with the year-long deadline the State has imposed upon local governments to adopt a housing element. 145",body_text,text,0.9923562645397142,35,208,california_law_review_morgan-democracy

"Given the similarities between the Coastal Commission's approval of land use plans and the RHNA process, including HCD certification of housing elements, Yost seems to suggest that a court would classify the adoption of housing elements as legislative, even without the statutory definition. 157 Nonetheless, the court's holding in Yost confirms that housing elements would be considered administrative. 158 The court distinguished Yost from Simpson v. Hite by saying that, in Simpson , the only discretion in the hands of a local government was 'the choice of a site' for a courthouse. 159 In contrast, local governments under the Coastal Act had discretion over what to build, so long as their decisions complied with the State's 'specific policies' outlined in the Coastal Act. 160 In the present case, the adoption of a housing element requires cities to plan for a specific amount of housing, 161 unlike the Coastal Act's broad land use oversight. 162 The Coastal Act did not 'dictate that a local government must build a hotel and conference center,' 163 but RHNA laws do dictate that a local government must plan for a specific amount of housing. 164 Despite the factual similarities to Yost , the adoption and amendment of a housing element fall into the Simpson v.

Superior Court , the court worried that allowing referenda on administrative actions 'would place municipal government in a straight-jacket and make it impossible for the city's officers to carry on the public business.' 173 In other words, there are valid policy reasons to allow the state to preempt the local referendum power in order to implement its policy.

"Revising the City of Morgan Hill test could have implications beyond the housing realm. Initiatives and referenda do not just occur in housing contexts; indeed, the COST factors developed from a case dealing with the construction of new roads. 192 Since this Note's proposal is to fold in the administrativelegislative test as a COST factor, it would retain both case law using the administrative-legislative test and caselaw using the COST factors. The impact of this Note's proposal would be to preempt local direct democracy in scenarios, housing or otherwise, where there is an expansive yet textually vague set of state regulations on a given issue that the statute deems legislative.",body_text,text,0.9318840579710145,50,293,california_law_review_morgan-democracy
"That is a pretty specific set of criteria! Interestingly, no other statutory scheme that cites to Section 1085, which outlines writ of mandate review, specifically defines the action as legislative. 193 Similarly, there are no other statutes that use the language of Section 65301.5, which declares the adoption or amendment of a general plan element to be a 'legislative act which shall be reviewable pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure.' 194 Accordingly, while this Note's proposal would not limit itself to changing housing laws, it appears as if only housing elements fall within the (extremely) narrow set of cases that would be affected by this change.",body_text,text,0.9911634756995582,51,294,california_law_review_morgan-democracy
