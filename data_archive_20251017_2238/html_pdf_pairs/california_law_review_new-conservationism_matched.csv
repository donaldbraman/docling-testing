"Environmental law has an animal problem. It lacks an account of whether and how animals' interests matter. Case in point: The agencies tasked with protecting wild animals cannot stop killing them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration slays sea lions to reduce predation on endangered salmon. The Fish and Wildlife Service shoots barred owls to curb competition with northern spotted owls. These widespread 'removals' reflect a tension between safeguarding ecological collectives, such as species and ecosystems, and protecting individual animals.",body_text,text,0.9946524064171123,0,2,california_law_review_new-conservationism
"Wild animals' uncertain status destabilizes conservation law, the branch of environmental law aimed at protecting natural resources, land, and wildlife. Yet the topic has received little attention from environmental legal scholars. This Article steps into that gap. First, it traces the development of competing reasons to protect wildlifepreserving ecological collectives and safeguarding individual animals-and explains how marquee conservation statutes, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, contain both intuitions. Such statutes, however, say little about what to do when the two goals conflict. Resolving this tension falls to administrative agencies' discretion.",body_text,text,0.9951489951489951,1,3,california_law_review_new-conservationism

The investigation draws on a novel analysis of more than one hundred National Environmental Policy Act reviews compiled through database searches and Freedom of Information Act requests. What emerges from this research is a thicket of incoherent agency attempts to incorporate individual animals' inherent value into removals. Agencies may: (a) express no concern for individual animals; (b) recognize only negative duties toward animals (such as avoiding the infliction of suffering); or (c) observe positive duties toward animals (such as rescuing animals from harsh ecological conditions). Approaches vary across and within agencies, and even within individual agency decisions.

According to a traditional conservationist view, individual animals have value only to the extent they make up part of a greater whole that needs protection. 9 Humans, therefore, must avoid harming-and perhaps should affirmatively protect-members of endangered plant and animal species but need not worry about members of abundant species. Killing eastern gray squirrels, for example, poses no conservation problem, no matter how inhumane the method, because the supply of gray squirrels runs high. In fact, if eastern gray squirrels posed a threat to an endangered species, then conservationist principles might require killing them.

"As a threshold matter, NEPA analyses reveal that agencies regularly consider abundant animals' well-being in conservation-based removal decisions. In other words, agencies' widespread reliance on removals is not the result of blanket indifference to individual animals' inherent value.

"Second, utilitarianism not only permits but requires intervention to improve net welfare. Under such a framework, agencies could find themselves required to intervene much more frequently than they currently do to benefit animals. Some statutes provide helpful limits. The WHA instructs agencies to maintain range management activities 'at the minimal feasible level,' and the ESA forbids actions that drive species to the brink of extinction, no matter the net benefit of doing so. 278 A lack of information may present another practical limitation, at least for the present. If agencies lack sufficient information to assess the effects of their actions, they may refrain from intervening-absent improvements in access to information. This holds true even under a utilitarian framework. 279 Nonetheless, statutes leave agencies significant discretion to intervene, and, in situations with clear animal welfare implications, agencies working from a utilitarian model would need to develop an approach to prioritize interventions.",body_text,text,0.9941804073714839,180,561,california_law_review_new-conservationism

"Ecological harms caused indirectly by humans also pose difficulties for an animal rights framework. Habitat fragmentation and climate change make life hard for many individual wild animals. But recognizing a positive duty to rescue animals from such conditions-as BLM and the Forest Service do with respect to equids-contradicts the animal rights principle that animals should be left alone. Of course, one might respond that humans should not have damaged animals' habitats in the first place.

"Despite these challenges, conservation decisions could align more closely with an animal rights approach than they do at present. Agencies could pursue minimal interventions that forestall more invasive measures. For example, agencies provide water sources or 'guzzlers' for wildlife in arid areas. 283 Such actions do not violate animal rights and may reduce the need for removals in some cases. 284 Agencies could also recognize a right against inhumane removals. Such an approach would hew closely to FWS's treatment of barred owls (providing strict lethal removal guidelines to minimize the risk of nonlethal injury or unnecessary suffering). 285 And agencies could raise the burden of proof required to show that abundant animals pose a threat and require removal. A heavier burden might take several forms, such as requiring more certainty that abundant animals threaten statutorily protected ecosystems or species, a greater degree of threatened harm to trigger intervention, or a greater certainty of removals' benefits to prevent extinction. To be sure, in some circumstances, statutes would require removals, but agencies could significantly reduce the number of removals conducted while remaining within statutory bounds.",body_text,text,0.993109039319011,185,572,california_law_review_new-conservationism

"Finally, agencies should discuss effects of removal to individual animals beyond removed species. At a minimum, decisions motivated by saving endangered populations should discuss consequences for individual animals in the endangered group. The benefits of removal to those animals should be apparent and easy to describe. 299 To the extent that such effects are uncertain, agencies' proposals may have broader problems. For example, if agencies cannot confidently predict that monk seal pups will suffer less with fewer sharksperhaps because pups may instead starve-that ambivalence casts doubt on removals' effectiveness at protecting seal populations and calls into question species-based justification for such actions. 300 Agencies also should attempt to include effects on individual animals of unlisted species.
