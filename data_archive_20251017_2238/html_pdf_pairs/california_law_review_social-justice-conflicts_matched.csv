"'Social justice' is everywhere in public law. Scholars and activists are calling for racial justice, climate justice, and health justice, among other claims. When commentators speak about multiple different social justice claims, it is often through an intersectional lens that views these claims as co-constitutive with one another, such as, 'There is no climate justice without racial justice.' These justice claims are important and long overdue.",body_text,text,0.9910913140311804,0,2,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"This Article argues that political institutions should embrace 'mid-level justice principles' to analyze justice conflicts. Mid-level justice principles are justice principles that apply across different policy areas and provide standing moral reasons to justify certain policy outcomes. Until now, public law has mostly embraced only procedural justice principles, such as consultation requirements and regulatory impact analyses. While helpful, these procedural measures do not provide substantive guidance about how to actually resolve justice conflicts. Mid-level justice principles fill this gap.",body_text,text,0.9966722129783694,2,6,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
"While political institutions have implicitly adopted some midlevel justice principles in an uneven fashion, this Article provides avenues for Congress, the President, and agencies to explicitly and consistently institutionalize mid-level justice principles. These proposals will improve policymaking and provide a mechanism to transparently analyze nonquantifiable normative values, which has thus far perplexed regulators, as well as both proponents and skeptics of costbenefit analysis. While the Supreme Court has increasingly inserted itself as the institutional arbiter of social justice claims, the Court's assertion of its primacy to evaluate justice conflicts should be resisted on democratic and epistemic grounds. Instead, 'democratic policymaking,' which occurs via Congress, the President, and administrative agencies, should be the primary site to resolve justice conflicts in our society.",body_text,text,0.9955703211517165,3,7,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
"In the early 2000s, the Navajo Nation petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for an air quality permit needed to build a new coal power plant in northeast Arizona. 1 The Clean Air Act (CAA) treats Native nations similar to states, so the EPA has authority to review any petition from Native nations for new pollution sources to ensure they fall within CAA emission standards. 2 The Navajo historically rely on coal for economic resources. Currently, the mining, production, and use of coal accounts for 42 percent of revenue in the Navajo Nation's General Fund. 3 The Navajo have also historically embraced their coal resources to promote their own sovereignty within the overarching colonial and capitalist structures they have been subjected to for most of America's history. 4 Coal-related economic activity provides thousands of well-paying jobs for Navajo members living on or near their reservation, 5 which has a 48.5 percent unemployment rate. 6 Navajo political leaders argued that the new plant, called Desert Rock, would serve a vital role in stabilizing their economy given plans to phase out existing power plants in the coming decades. 7",body_text,text,0.9893481039625053,5,11,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"The Nation's permit saga raised multiple distinct types of social justice claims, including racial, economic, environmental, energy, and climate justice. In philosophical literature, each of these justice claims, such as racial justice or environmental justice, is known as an 'applied justice' claim because the claim of what a group is owed is restricted to a specific policy domain. 16 For example, environmental justice pertains to the demands of justice only within the domain of environmental policy. In recent years, scholars and activists have created a number of different types of various applied justice claims. It is now commonplace to see calls for racial, gender, reproductive, economic, labor, health, environmental, climate, energy, and disability justice, among other applied justice claims. 17",body_text,text,0.9741379310344828,8,29,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

In the wake of John Rawls publishing his groundbreaking A Theory of Justice in 1971, 27 public law scholars spent the next few decades trying to institutionalize 'basic justice' principles, which attempt to establish the overall structures to distribute goods, benefits, or services within society. 28 As opposed to applied justice principles, which cover only one policy area, basic justice principles attempt to cover the entirety of social justice itself. However, given increased levels of moral pluralism and political polarization in America, by the end of the twentieth century, many scholars no longer believed that a consensus on basic justice principles was possible. 29",body_text,text,0.9922480620155039,11,46,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"The primary purpose of this Article is to determine whether public law can develop a principled framework to resolve justice conflicts and which political institutions should have the power to resolve them. In furtherance of this purpose, this Article articulates the category of mid-level justice principles and demonstrates how current and future political institutions, including presidential administrations, can use them to analyze policy involving social justice that resists quantification, such as with justice conflicts. 46 Adopting mid-level justice principles provides a consistent and principled mechanism for political institutions to qualitatively analyze important normative values, such as social justice. The Article also argues that institutions adopt and prioritize one particular mid-level justice principle, egalitarian reparative justice, due to its importance in rectifying past governmental harms and substantiating political equality in our democratic government. In the case of Desert Rock, this reparative justice principle creates strong pro tanto reasons that the EPA should have granted the Navajo Nation's permit, despite its harms to the climate. 47",body_text,text,0.9966159052453468,15,72,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

The notable exception here is CBA, but it suffers from well-known problems when policy issues involve normative values that escape full quantification. This Part then critically engages with the Biden Administration's actions to improve normative evaluation in policymaking.

Given this interdisciplinary nature, the Article's primary purpose is to advance an overarching framework for examining justice conflicts that creates analytical space for others to push the conversation forward regarding their preferred substantive theories of social justice.

"One prominent historical example of a justice conflict took place during the labor unionization push in the early twentieth century and resulting union mergers in the mid-twentieth century. Early twentieth century labor unions had different strategic ways to increase membership. 95 On one hand, unions could expand membership to women and minority groups, which would further racial and gender justice goals. However, this strategy ran the risk of reducing the number of White men who would join because racist and misogynist White men might in turn reject unions as an organizing strategy or create competing exclusionary unions. This outcome would hinder the economic justice goals of the union, given that White men were the numerically dominant group in the labor force at the time.",body_text,text,0.9980952380952381,43,165,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

This position would consolidate their White male membership to improve their economic justice goals at the cost of harming gender and racial justice goals. Thus, labor unions were left with a choice-expand membership to improve racial and gender justice or restrict membership to maximize economic justice. In the early twentieth century, unions differed on which social justice claims to prioritize. However, in the 1950s, the biggest union in America, the newly merged AFL-CIO, chose the latter strategy to prioritize economic justice over racial and gender justice and subsequently dominated the union landscape in the ensuing decades. 96",body_text,text,0.9971181556195965,44,166,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"The second reason is to mitigate false positives. Recognizing illusory justice conflicts is important because opponents of social justice often create illusory justice conflicts opportunistically as a political strategy to block social change. One prominent example of this tactic is its use by the police, who strategically make racial justice appeals grounded in the right of minority populations to live in a safe community as a means to reduce support for criminal justice reform. Dream Defenders, an abolitionist non-profit organization in Florida, ran into this potential justice conflict when it began its criminal justice reform advocacy efforts in Florida. 122 Their polling found that minority groups were receptive to the police's framing, potentially complicating their understanding of the relationship between criminal and racial justice. 123 However, Dream Defenders subsequently found that being able to concretize alternative conceptions of what minority community safety could look like without more police led to increased support for reducing police funding among minority groups. 124 Dream Defenders found alternative means to satisfy the twin claims of criminal and racial justice by embracing the problems raised by their community, but rejecting the police's framing of the solution.",body_text,text,0.9950324799388612,52,207,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"This Part delineates a conceptual point regarding the concept of justice that is occasionally assumed in public law, 133 but has yet to be examined. 134 The concept of social justice operates at three different levels of abstraction: basic, mid-level, and applied. Once these different levels of social justice are explained, it will be shown that public law has largely focused on substantiating only the procedural justice elements of mid-level justice principles. While cost benefit analysis (CBA) is the prominent exception here, it suffers from well-known analytical problems when policy issues involve normative values that cannot be fully quantified. As a result, political institutions are currently without substantive guidance on how to make decisions on policy issues that create justice conflicts, which often leads them to publicly downplay the importance of such nonquantifiable normative values in their decision-making.

"Regarding its normative weight, an applied justice principle is meant to provide a reason that is decisive as a matter of justice with respect to policy issues within its singular domain. Alternatively phrased, an applied justice principle, unlike a basic justice principle, gives you an outcome that you should adopt as a matter of social justice. 143 In Cass Sunstein's influential phrasing, applied justice principles constitute the 'low-level principles' that generate 'incompletely theorized agreements.' 144",body_text,text,0.9552529182879378,63,258,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
"To further elaborate the distinction between these levels of justice, it is useful to discuss how these levels can be misused when analyzing policy issues. One potential misuse of Rawls's principles of justice is to ask how these principles would answer specific public policy issues. For example, one might ask, 'How much should the top 1 percent be taxed under Rawls's principles of justice?' Asking this question of Rawls's principles would be a category mistake. The principles operate on a basic justice level, not an applied justice level. In short, there is a mischaracterization of the principles' level of abstraction and their resulting ability to address the policy issue. The abstraction level of the tax policy issue (applied justice) does not match the abstraction level of the principle (basic justice). Thus, the basic justice principle does not provide any normative weight to answer the specific policy question at issue. An applied justice principle is needed if one seeks a principle that provides an outcome to determine the tax rate for the top 1 percent as a matter of justice.",body_text,text,0.9945454545454545,64,259,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

Similarly, mid-level justice principles have a domain restriction that is wider than one policy area (applied justice principles), but less than the totality of social justice (basic justice principles).

"Given their amorphous intermediate character, it is helpful to contrast midlevel justice principles from basic and applied justice principles. Mid-level justice principles are distinguished from applied justice principles by two features. First, a mid-level justice principle's domain is wider than one single policy issue, and second, its normative weight is merely pro tanto , which is of a lesser weight than being decisive, as is the case for an applied justice principle. Regarding their domain, a mid-level justice principle can cover multiple policy areas, such as environmental, energy, and climate justice. The covered policy areas do not need to be related. In this respect, mid-level justice principles are trans-substantive, while applied justice principles are not. Consider cost-benefit analysis (CBA), which, as discussed in the next Part, is a mid-level justice principle. 152 CBA is trans-substantive because it can be used to analyze policy issues across different domains, such as environmental, securities regulation, and criminal justice policies.",body_text,text,0.9967243799719232,66,266,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

As will be discussed later, it is also theoretically possible for multiple mid-level justice principles to overlap in a specific policy domain. 154 Consequently, while mid-level justice principles are trans-substantive, they do not cover the totality of all domains in which social justice operates, unlike a basic justice principle.",body_text,text,0.9955817378497791,67,267,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

In addition to the harms caused by such nontransparent interagency variability, this permissiveness of the Justice40 initiative regarding how agencies could define and prioritize disadvantaged communities could also create new justice conflicts. These new justice conflicts would be created, for example, if an agency is choosing between directing benefits towards a disadvantaged community whose economy previously relied on fossil fuel extraction (abandoned mine and at or below 65th percentile for the low-income factor for disadvantaged under the Justice40 screening tool) or a marginalized community whose air was polluted from such fossil fuel extraction (90th percentile for PM2.5 in the air and at/below 65th percentile for the low-income factor for disadvantaged under the Justice40 screening tool). 293 By taking such a permissive approach to defining disadvantaged communities for the sake of comprehensiveness, the Justice40 initiative did not provide any mechanism for agencies to mitigate justice conflicts.

"The Court's recent hostility to social justice should not be surprising given the Court's historic hostility to social justice. As Niko Bowie and Daphna Renan have shown, the Court took a central role to roll back congressional attempts to improve the sociopolitical status of African Americans after the Civil War. 364 More recently, judicial responses to the rise of the environmental justice movement are illustrative. In short, federal courts were uniformly hostile to substantive environmental and racial justice claims brought by litigants.

"The Court's recent move to make itself the primary arbiter of social justice claims should be resisted. Instead, democratic policymaking, which includes Congress, the President, and agencies, should be the primary institutional forum for decision-making on matters of social justice. 392 Most obviously, congressional, presidential, and administrative policymaking all have better democratic pedigrees than judicial policymaking on matters of social justice. While congressional and presidential democratic superiority may appear selfevident given their electoral nature, agencies engage in extensive formal and informal deliberations with potentially affected persons during policymaking, giving them a nonrepresentative mechanism of democratic legitimacy. 393 Importantly, the democratic superiority of Congress, the President, and agencies to the courts occurs on both procedural 394 and substantive 395 theories of democracy.

"Loper Bright will only further expand the domain of judicial deliberation by allowing courts to refuse to give any deference to agency interpretations that were generated in accordance with the democratic policymaking process. Thus, federal courts now have an increased ability to disregard the interagency and stakeholder communication that typically occurs during the democratic policymaking process to instead insert their own preferred interpretation of the relevant statute. Given these factors, judicial policymaking on matters of social justice appears both normatively and epistemically inferior to democratic policymaking. 412",body_text,text,0.997639653815893,165,687,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts

"admitted, concretizing calls for different intersecting social justice claims during policymaking creates justice conflicts. Currently, public law lacks any principled mechanism to analyze and resolve justice conflicts.

"Policymakers should analyze justice conflicts by selecting mid-level justice principles to prioritize as standing default rules during policymaking. By providing standing moral reasons to favor certain policy outcomes across intersecting social justice domains, mid-level principles provide stable and transparent default rules for political actors to mitigate justice conflicts when they arise in policymaking. Mid-level justice principles also present an appealing and structured approach to engaging in qualitative normative reasoning, which has thus far perplexed both advocates and critics of cost-benefit analysis.",body_text,text,1.0,168,696,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
"In addition to the egalitarian reparative justice principle advocated for in this Article, future research will be needed to generate specific mid-level justice principles that should be implemented by different political institutions. This research should be sensitive to the fact that the desirability of specific mid-level justice principles is likely to vary based upon multiple considerations, including the political institution and affected communities in question.",body_text,text,1.0,169,697,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
"Given the iterative nature of modern democratic policymaking, multiple political institutions can institutionalize mid-level justice principles. Congress could specify certain mid-level justice principles in statutes that implementing agencies should prioritize. The President could issue executive orders specifying how mid-level justice principles should be included during regulatory analysis and coordinate best practices between agencies. Agencies could promulgate rules or guidance documents to establish standing preferences regarding which mid-level justice principles should be prioritized in regulatory analysis. These mechanisms to institutionalize mid-level justice principles would improve the consideration of nonquantifiable values during CBA, provide transparent and consistent default rules to guide policymaking, and insulate the outcomes of democratic policymaking from the Supreme Court's recent expansion of its powers to resolve cases involving social justice claims.",body_text,text,0.9989888776541962,170,698,california_law_review_social-justice-conflicts
