"This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials' perception of the 'median voter' away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",body_text,text,0.9896337249481686,0,2,california_law_review_voter-pay

"If I promise to give you $20, and all you need to do in return is vote in the next election, would you do it? Your answer to that question likely depends on several considerations. For example, when was the last time you voted? How far could you stretch that $20? Would you get the money today, in two weeks, or in six months? Would it be illegal for you to accept the money, or for me to give it to you? Unfortunately for you, the answer to that last pair of questions is 'yes.' But what if instead, the government offered you $20 for casting a ballot? This Note explores that question by detailing the participatory, economic, and legal considerations that would arise were the government to implement a voter incentive program.",body_text,text,0.9972602739726028,2,7,california_law_review_voter-pay

"So, how would paying voters address this concern? The theory behind a voter incentive program proceeds as follows: Incentives influence behavior. A program that pays people to cast a ballot would increase participation, and offering a relatively small size of the payment would incentivize turnout in lower-income communities at higher rates than in wealthier ones. Seeing new activity from historically low-propensity voters, campaigns and lawmakers behind those campaigns would turn their organizing efforts, policy proposals, and attention away from the wealthy and towards the lower-income and underrepresented segments of the electorate.",body_text,text,1.0,4,9,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Scholars, advocates, and lawmakers have proposed (and enacted) excellent policies that would do much to increase participation. Indeed, American democracy would likely be better off if lawmakers implemented ideas like sameday voter registration, universal vote by mail, compulsory voting, a federal holiday for election day, and consolidated local elections. Yet the focus of this Note-a policy I refer to as a 'voter incentive program'-operates in a liminal space between campaign finance and participation. It seeks to level the influence playing field by increasing participation.",body_text,text,0.9922879177377892,5,10,california_law_review_voter-pay
"To date, proposals to incentivize voting have received scant academic attention. In my research, I came across only one article that seriously addressed the topic.

This Note argues that a voter incentive program is worth deeper consideration. Paying people to vote could achieve many of the participatory goals as the policies noted above in a much more direct fashion while also checking wealth influence.

"I am sure many who pick up this Note may think that there are bigger fish to fry-or perhaps bigger DOGEs to leash. So why this, now? Unfortunately, democratic erosion has become a norm rather than an aberration in the United States. Stricter voting laws, partisan gerrymandering, and a hollowing out of campaign finance law, to name but a few, have all weakened once-robust political institutions. So, in the face of democratic backsliding, those committed to the project of representative and multiracial democracy must continue advancing policies and reforms that push back against these recent trends and bring the vision of representative democracy closer to fruition.

"Level-up thinking is highly relevant to a voter incentive program. The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in cities and states that have significantly reduced barriers to voting. Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for smalldollar donors. 26 Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors. 27 Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result in greater progress towards achieving a representative electorate and ultimately addressing democratic imbalance. A great policy proposal that leverages this type of level-up thinking to address electoral imbalance is the Mobilization Matching Fund, proposed by Professor Bertrall Ross II. 28 This policy would use federal dollars to match campaign expenditures used to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent electoral participation, commonly referred to as 'low-propensity voters.' 29",body_text,text,0.9950909615939937,17,54,california_law_review_voter-pay

Voucher programs, matching fund programs, and the Mobilization Matching Fund all require involvement from a third party: the campaign apparatus. By contrast, a voter incentive program does not rely on any engagement between a campaign and a voter. Instead, the government would cut out the middleman and incentivize turnout by paying the voter directly. There could be numerous benefits from this approach. For example, removing the campaign as an intermediary could reduce transaction costs, thereby lowering the overall budget constraints of the program.

Specifically, political participation may fall prey to problems of collective action and positive externalities.

"Microeconomic theory may provide some insight into low turnout rates. Market-based theories posit that an individual will act based on the perceived utility of their action. For example, numerous political science models have used these same theories to explain why an individual chooses to stay home on election day. 41 Such theories weigh factors like a voter's perceived benefit, duty, or probability of casting the decisive vote against the costs of voting, like waiting in line or skipping work. 42",body_text,text,0.9920634920634921,24,81,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Two specific economic frameworks help to explain why a voter may choose to stay home and indicate that an incentive program may alter that decision: positive externality problems and collective action problems. First, voting may suffer from a positive externality problem. A positive externality is 'a consequence or side effect of one's economic activity' that 'benefits' an individual or individuals other than the person engaging in the economic activity. 43 These spillover benefits are 'external' because at scale they accrue to society's benefit; the individual voter does not realize the benefit upon casting their vote. 44 In a theoretical exploration of positive externalities and voting, Stefan Krasa and Mattias Polborn have described this phenomenon as follows: Assume two candidates, A and B , are running for office. About 60 percent of the population supports Candidate A , but, in a hypothetical match-up, Candidate A wins by only one vote. Many of Candidate A 's supporters stayed home. Those who turned out to vote for Candidate A impose a positive externality on society by electing the general population's preferred candidate. 45",body_text,text,0.922608695652174,25,82,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Why did Candidate A 's supporters stay home? Assume that Candidate A is popular because they champion an economic program that promises broad social benefits. When a voter-let's call her Jane-casts her ballot, she does not immediately reap the benefits of Candidate A 's economic program; the program could take years to enact. Thus, the immediate benefit that Jane derives from voting is quite low. Jane will consider the costs of voting-driving to the polls, waiting in line, missing work-and may decide to stay home. 46 If, say, Jane's family and friends make the same decision, participation will fall, and Candidate B might win.

"Second, low participation may result from a collective action problem, a concept related to but distinct from the positive externality problem. 49 Collective action problems arise when there exists some nonexcludable public good, meaning that it is impossible to prevent any one individual from enjoying or using the good. 50 If Jane believes that she can benefit from the election of Candidate A regardless of whether or not she votes, she may stay home and 'free ride' off the participation of her peers. 51 The likelihood that Jane will free ride rises the less she perceives her vote as being pivotal to the election's outcome. Scholars have estimated that an individual has a one in sixty million probability of casting a decisive ballot in American elections. 52 Indeed, in 2020, 16 percent of non-voters stayed home because they believed that their vote would not make a difference. 53",body_text,text,0.9782001117942984,27,91,california_law_review_voter-pay

"Coinciding positive externalities and free riding indicates that direct incentives may be a solution to non-voting. Solutions to an externality problem focus on internalizing the benefits (or the costs) at the level of individual decision making. 58 Even if all the costs of voting fall away, Jane may still stay home. But if Jane sees an immediate and tangible benefit for her vote, here a small payment, her decision to stay home might change.

"Accepting the proposition that campaigns are one of the main mechanisms through which voters become more educated about the issues in a campaign, the fear of the 'uneducated' or 'perfunctory' voter begins to dissolve. Today, campaigns may avoid low-propensity voters in part because targeting a lowpropensity voter (about whom the campaign has no data of partisan affiliation) may cause that voter to support the opposition. 71 Thus, the outreach itself poses a risk to the candidate. But where a non-voter is incentivized to cast a ballot by way of an external incentive (e.g., a financial subsidy), campaigns may in turn view these voters as an opportunity rather than a risk. A campaign may want to contact newly incentivized voters to frame their message before the opposition has the chance to do so.

"often do not vote is that in many cities, there are simply too many elections. 85 Cities that consolidate their elections to align with state or national elections can reduce their long-term costs by sharing those costs with other levels of government that hold elections on the same day. 86 In a sense, the overabundance of local elections may impose a negative externality of diminished voter participation on localities. As discussed in Part II.B, a $20 subsidy to the voter may internalize the positive externalities of voting at the individual level. Similarly, requiring localities to pay for such a program may internalize the negative externalities of abundant elections at the governmental level. Indeed, if implementing a voter-incentive policy also incentivizes cities to consolidate elections to defray costs, this too could have a knock-on participatory benefit. Voters pay attention to elections when they occur less frequently. 87",body_text,text,0.8272300469483568,47,160,california_law_review_voter-pay
"The final, and perhaps least concerning, risk potentially associated with a voter incentive program is that candidates for office-particularly incumbentswill find ways to take credit for the program. I call this the 'credit-claiming risk.' In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act and in doing so enacted the Clean Elections Amendment, which made it a federal crime to financially incentivize paying an individual to vote. 88 The provision's purpose was 'to stop fraudulent registrations and vote buying in any election involving national candidates.' 89 At the time of the Voting Rights Act's passage, its drafters understood that candidates might conscript the levers of government to achieve their ends, typically by promising voters jobs in exchange for electoral support. 90",body_text,text,0.9847522236340533,48,162,california_law_review_voter-pay

"Two factors may exacerbate the credit-claiming risk. First, the risk increases as the dollar amount the government pays increases. A voter might feel more thankful to a politician for a $500 check than they would for a $20 check. A solution to this risk is to keep the payment amount relatively small, an approach that comports with similar policies that reward individuals for fulfilling their constitutional duties. For example, in California, jurors receive no more than $15 per day for their jury service. 94 Second, the credit-claiming risk may rise in states and localities where a single party dominates the electoral process. For example, in New York, the Democratic Party controlled forty-five of the fifty-one city council seats following the 2023 election. 95 There, voters may associate a policy with the Democratic Party, whose officials may in turn use that association to further entrench their power. While this concern may be valid, it stems more from the United States's increased geographic political polarization rather than from the voter incentive policy itself. And lawmakers can ameliorate this concern by ceding administration of the policy to a nonpartisan, politically insulated body.",body_text,text,0.9966996699669967,50,171,california_law_review_voter-pay
"The heart of this concern is more complex than the fear that an elected official will take credit for a generally applicable program. Elected officials should take credit for programs they implement; doing so can protect that program from repeal later on. Rather, the concern is that an elected official may insinuate that receipt of the program's benefit is contingent upon a favorable vote, which implicates the heart of the Clean Elections Amendment. But every policy that benefits a constituency is susceptible to this risk. Though voters may elect a specific party to strengthen or reform programs like Medicare or Social Security, it is unlikely that the electorate gives the incumbent credit for Social Security benefits or Medicare benefits, given that the programs have been around for many decades. Indeed, over time voters come to understand such programs",body_text,text,0.8853633572159673,51,172,california_law_review_voter-pay

"In summary, any new program or policy comes with risks. Some of those risks, like credit-claiming, are attendant to every type of policy. For newer risks, like over incentivizing frequent or affluent voters, policymakers can tailor the incentive to optimize the program to target those voters who simply turn out to vote less frequently. Despite the potential unknowns, a voter incentive program is an adaptable policy that can provide a solution to the collective action and externality problems inherent in voting.

"Although the statute's plain language is broad-purporting to criminalize any use of financial means to incentivize voting-courts have narrowly construed this statute in two distinct ways. On the one hand, courts have read this language as only applying to the election of federal officers. 100 Thus, no person could challenge a voter incentive program under this statute where the program operates in an election in which only state or local officers appear on the ballot. 101 Indeed, this comports with the principle that courts avoid applying statutes to states unless Congress clearly indicates its intent to regulate state activities. 102 On the other hand, to indict somebody under the statute, the government must show that an individual made an expenditure with the purpose of influencing the election of a federal officer. 103 Thus, where an individual paid another to influence the election of a state official-even where a federal officer appeared on the ballot-¬ß 597 would not apply. 104 Further, the requirement that a payment have the purpose of influencing a federal election indicates that the statute does not apply to a voter incentive program because an incentive program seeks to increase turnout and not sway the election in a given direction. The 'influence' such a policy might have on an election would be available to every voter who turns in a ballot, not in exchange for supporting one candidate or another.

Far from corrupting the vote, such a program would bring more voters to the polls, irrespective of how they cast their ballot. And in turn, increased participation safeguards the integrity of the process, 132 which places a voter incentive program in line with the Clean Elections Amendment's underlying purpose. Finally, the Amendment's drafters feared that an illegally cast ballot would cancel out a validly cast ballot. 133 This fear implicates a concern that one voter may cast their ballot under different considerations-namely commercial-from another voter, thus compromising the integrity of certain votes.

By contrast, if a city set the incentive level much higher-say $2,000-and implemented it via a tax rebate instead of a direct incentive, a non-voter may have a stronger case that such a policy burdens or unduly influences them to forego their right to stay home. 169 Finally, states can substantially lessen any burden by allowing non-voters to cast a blank ballot and receive the benefit for simply showing up at the polls. 170",body_text,text,0.8252788104089219,82,300,california_law_review_voter-pay

Withholding incentives from non-voters may indirectly and minimally burden those who stay home for political purposes.

"I am skeptical that non-voting amounts to expressive conduct under Spence . Eason argues that voting is expressive conduct, and non-voting might therefore receive First Amendment protection as a corollary to the right not to speak. 188 But this analytical approach misapprehends the potential political nature of nonvoting. A voter who wants to make a point by not voting necessarily sees some communicative value in their decision to stay home that is distinct from the expressive nature of affirmatively casting a ballot. Instead of deriving the right not to vote from the right not to speak, a litigant may instead argue that the right not to vote derives directly from the right to speak.

"Under Spence 's first factor, the Court found that Johnson intended to convey a particular message by burning the flag; it served as 'the culmination' of his 'political demonstration' at the Republican National Convention. 190 Although voting clearly intends to convey a message of support or opposition to a candidate, can we say the same about non-voting? Sure, a non-voter may stay home to express their narrow dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates. 191 Or, the non-voter may wish to express broad frustration with the entire system of democracy by refusing to take part. Indeed, in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc. , the Supreme Court discussed the choice to refuse to register to vote. 192 '[T]here are also individuals for whom . . . the choice not to register implicates political thought and expression . . . because they don't believe that the political process is responsive to their needs.' 193",body_text,text,0.9338313767342583,91,335,california_law_review_voter-pay
"But the argument that non-voting implicates political thought and expression assumes that every voter has a message-based reason for not voting when in fact people stay home for myriad reasons. A voter might stay home because they feel generally apathetic about the election or because they feel uninformed on the issues. But a voter's choice to stay home does not necessarily imply an intent to convey a message to the public. Indeed, many people choose to stay home because the costs of showing up are too high, the polling place is too far, the lines are too long, or the time spent working is too valuable. 194 Unlike setting fire to the flag, one of the clearest and most evocative ways to express dissatisfaction with the country, the picture of the non-voter's intent is blurry.

"First, in furtherance of building a robust and scalable policy, it may be easier for researchers to compare the effects of a voter incentive program to policies in other cities. Several cities across the country have implemented programs that seek to democratize campaign finance. 219 For example, Seattle has a 'democracy voucher' program that gives voters vouchers they can donate to a campaign. 220 Although this program addresses unequal financial participation in campaign contributions, it likely has a knock-on effect of increased voter participation. Researchers could conduct comparative empirical analyses that compare the effects that such programs have on voter turnout, or even electoral balancing, as compared to a voter incentive program. Studying this at the purely local level will also help researchers control for confounding variables to truly isolate the effect that a small-dollar payment has on a voter's decision to vote. For example, in a mixed election that uses a voter incentive program, a voter who would not otherwise vote in a purely local election may show up to vote for a state or federal candidate. Thus, teasing out the causal impact of a voter incentive program may be easier at the local level, where fewer variables weigh on a voter's decision to vote.

In Pima County, 38 percent of voters are registered Democrats compared to 27.6 percent Republicans, 223 and in 2020, about 60 percent of Pima County voters cast a ballot for Mayes. 224 A policy that increases voter turnout in only one county could swing a state-wide election with such thin margins. 225 To ensure that this policy does not have unintended spillover effects on other levels of government, incentives must be made available to every voter in a given election.

"become [more] involved.' 238 A visible policy signals to people that they are valued community members and thus encourages other forms of participation. 239 Visible benefits demonstrate a responsive government and encourage voters to show up, vote, and take part in policy formation. 240 Beyond simple turnout, a direct-incentive policy, by virtue of tying a government benefit to political participation, may encourage voters to participate in other ways, perhaps by showing up at a local council meeting or educating themselves on the issues in an upcoming election.",body_text,text,0.8408037094281299,114,422,california_law_review_voter-pay
"The critical challenge with a direct-incentive approach is implementing the program in a way that is visible to voters. The simplest way to achieve this goal might work as follows. A voter goes to their local polling place, casts their ballot, and then picks up a $20 bill on their way out of the polling place. Alternatively, the polling place manager might hand the voter a ballot receipt, which the voter takes to City Hall to collect their $20 bill.",body_text,text,1.0,115,423,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Perhaps counterintuitively, reforms that have reduced barriers to vote in states like California may make a direct incentive more challenging to implement. In 2021, Governor Newsom signed AB 37, which requires that every voter receives a ballot in the mail. 241 As a result, most Californians now vote at home instead of at a polling place. 242 So in a state like California, the implementing government would likely need to mail a check to a voter or directly deposit it in their account. A direct-deposit system could be particularly challenging to implement if a division like a county registrar's office runs the program. The registrar would need to acquire a voter's banking information and then set up a payment system. By contrast, registrar offices do have every voter's address; thus, mailing checks may be more straightforward for local elections officials. Further, in line with Mettler's preference for highly visible policy, mailing a check would do more to avoid the problems of submerged policy. Indeed, a government could even include an 'I Voted' sticker with every voter incentive check to make it abundantly clear to the voter that they are receiving a check because they cast a ballot.",body_text,text,0.9925373134328358,116,424,california_law_review_voter-pay

"operationalizing this type of program poses unique challenges. At the outset, the local government would need to verify that an individual voted. This would require building communication systems between the county registrar's office and whichever municipal finance office the government appoints to print and mail checks. Following that, the government must ensure each check makes it to the right household. In 2020 and 2021, the IRS and Treasury issued over $900 billion in direct payments to individuals as part of COVID-19 stimulus programs; in doing so the government ran into a lot of problems, including improper payments and getting funds to first-time tax filers and those experiencing homelessness. 243 Cities have developed tools to serve unhoused populations, 244 low-income tax filers, 245 and other hard-to-reach communities, 246 but if a highly resourced federal agency like the IRS faced challenges operationalizing a direct payment program, local governments might as well. Assuming that local governments can surmount such challenges, providing a direct subsidy would likely be the best way to achieve the goals of a voter incentive program.",body_text,text,0.9378806333739342,117,431,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Policymakers should also think critically about the frequency of benefit provision. The more frequently a government provides a benefit, the more expensive the benefit becomes. Thus, one potential solution to the high cost of this program is to provide an incentive to vote only in certain types of elections. For example, a city may opt to provide the benefit only in general elections and not primary elections 247 or in less frequent mayoral elections but not in more frequent city council races.",body_text,text,0.996996996996997,118,433,california_law_review_voter-pay

"Finally, governments should not make receipt of the benefit contingent on voting for a candidate.

"Allowing an option not to vote has critical constitutional significance depending on the level of scrutiny used to analyze the policy. I maintain that this policy is fully constitutional and does not burden any fundamental right. 250 But on the off chance that a court does find this policy burdens a right not to vote, that court will eventually proceed to a tailoring analysis in which, depending on the level of scrutiny, the policy must be tailored to meet the government's interest. If the government's interest is in increasing participation, then its focus is getting people to the polls, regardless of how they vote. Allowing an option not to vote tailors the policy to that interest. Moreover, for a non-voter who stays home out of protest, an option not to vote arguably makes their message of protest more concentrated and salient. 251 Under the current system, people stay home for an untold number of reasons, but casting a blank ballot sends a much clearer protest message. Thus, including a 'no vote' option brings more voices into the system and offers voters greater choice.",body_text,text,0.9871794871794872,121,443,california_law_review_voter-pay
"Policymakers interested in a voter incentive program should start small and explore implementing the program at the municipal level. Incentives should be direct, visible, and perhaps infrequent.

"to do what many of us consider a civic duty struck me as something that might degrade the collective value that Americans place on democratic participation. But then I considered the reality of the participatory landscape. Many people simply do not vote. Non-voting contributes to an economically imbalanced electorate, which in turn skews policy outcomes. This trend is even more pronounced in local elections, elections that have the most direct impact on our daily lives. And in states like California that have reduced nearly every barrier to voting, many still choose not to vote. Perhaps an extra nudge might do the trick.",body_text,text,0.8876325088339223,124,454,california_law_review_voter-pay
"I began this Note with a simple question: If I promise to give you $20, and all you need to do in return is to vote in the next election, would you do it? I am now more curious to know whether you think governments should pay their citizens to vote. My hope is that this Note contributes to the conversation about political participation. Much of my analysis only scratches the surface, and there is so much more work that can be done on this idea. I have demonstrated that a voter incentive program would likely pass statutory and constitutional muster. And with the right policy design-such as starting local and providing direct, visible, and infrequent incentives-a voter incentive policy might in fact bring new voters to the polls. All that remains is whether it is worth the time and the financial and political capital it would take for policymakers to take up such a proposal.",body_text,text,0.9977401129943503,125,455,california_law_review_voter-pay
