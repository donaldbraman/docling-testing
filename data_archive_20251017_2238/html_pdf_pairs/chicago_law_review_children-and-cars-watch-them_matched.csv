Additionally, robotaxis have cameras inside to record what is happening at all times, and Waymo support staff sometimes intervene when they see unsafe behavior. These cameras address a key concern for parents: Parents generally support AV use by their children, with a caveat. They want video surveillance that they can access at all times. While minors are not yet permitted to travel alone in Waymo vehicles, that policy is likely to change in the near future.

"This Essay considers the unique privacy issues that emerge based on the normalization of child ridership in AVs. As many scholars have argued, cars are not simply cars.

In this environment, aggregating location information to clinics and medical facilities raises the danger of prosecutions. As the Supreme Court articulated in Carpenter v. United States (2017), knowledge of an individual's movements over 'public thoroughfares and into private residences, doctor's offices, political headquarters, and other potentially revealing locales' can paint an extraordinarily detailed and intimate picture of their lives.

"Data collection is ubiquitous, and children are at particular risk. AVs (and smart vehicles in general) can collect and retain massive amounts of data, subjecting children to 'dataveillance' without their knowledge. This information-the child's location, actions, statements, imagery, and videos, can be shared with various parties, including law enforcement. AVs are part of a larger story of 'always-on' devices that constantly collect data from users, often without their knowledge or consent. The relentless data collection raises concerns about equity. Not all children will be subjected to privacy risks equally-those from marginalized communities with fewer transportation choices may suffer disproportionate surveillance.",body_text,text,0.9780521262002744,5,12,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them

"Self-driving cars have long captivated the world's imagination. They were the stuff of dreams, but they are now a reality. Vehicles with some level of automation, namely some basic safety features like cruise control, have been available for the last fifty years. But higher levels of automation are a new phenomenon. SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, has created a taxonomy for defining these various levels of automation, from level 0 (no driving automation) up to level 5 (full driving automation). Only recently have manufacturers been able to make level 3 and 4 vehicles. Level 4, exemplified by Waymo, allows for something closer to full autonomy.",body_text,text,0.9985380116959064,11,21,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"Advanced automation means much higher amounts of data collection and storage by AVs. AVs rely on more than a dozen cameras and sensors strategically positioned around the car. Today's AVs collect approximately one hundred times more data than a personal smartphone. While the primary purpose of this data collection is to enable safe and efficient autonomous driving, it inevitably captures personal information about individuals in the vehicle's vicinity. Cameras can potentially record identifiable faces, license plates, and even activities inside nearby buildings or homes.

"The privacy implications of AVs extend beyond personal ownership. Especially while the technology is still nascent, most people are likely to encounter AVs through ridesharing and rentals, making these contexts the most likely sites of data collection. AV fleets, such as Waymo, and more traditional models that may incorporate AVs in the future, like Uber and Lyft, track not just pickup and dropoff locations but also entire route histories and other personal information. Rented AVs are likely to collect similar information but tend to engage in greater integration with users' smart devices, absorbing demographic details, entertainment preferences, and contact lists.

Consider a vehicle company collecting information that allows their cars to safely and effectively transport passengers. However, this information is shared and sold to third parties, either directly or through data brokers, exposing passengers to secondary uses. Similarly, in the AV context, car companies might share behavioral data with third-party advertisers-for example, that an individual goes to a health clinic once a month. It is no surprise modern vehicles have been categorized as 'the worst performing product category for privacy protections.'",body_text,text,0.920075519194462,14,25,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them

"AV regulations are limited at both the federal and state level, in a way that parallels the general inertia of legal responses to technological advances. This section first examines AV-specific legislation, followed by broader privacy laws relevant to the data AVs collect. Roughly thirty-five states have legislation responsive to current AV technology; however, most of these statutes focus mainly on safety, rather than privacy. Only a single state, Utah, has proposed legislation mentioning children. In 2020, the state tried to enact provisions regarding transporting minors in AVs for-hire, mainly around safety. In a similar vein, the state tried to establish a working group the following year on unaccompanied minors and AVs but failed.",body_text,text,1.0,16,28,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"At the federal level, statutes or regulations are absent. In both 2017 and 2018, Congress failed to pass AV START, a bill aimed at regulating the safety and development of AVs. To date Congress has never passed legislation specific to automated driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued guidance on cybersecurity best practices for AVs, which serve as recommendations for the industry but lack the force of law. Although broad privacy laws might provide some protection, they are not equipped to handle the data practices of AVs. For example, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a federal law enacted in the 1990s to protect children who use online services, has a number of deficiencies. It protects only children under thirteen and relies upon notice and choice of parents.

However, the DPPA contains several exceptions that would seem to allow in-cabin monitoring to take place. These include legitimate needs by any government agency in carrying out its functions, and when there is a 'use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft' and 'motor vehicle market research activities.' In-cabin recordings might also not be considered a 'motor vehicle record' in the first place, thus evading the DPPA's protections altogether.

"There are a number of relevant state laws, though these too have limitations. California is one of the few states that provides consumers with limited protections around the personal information their vehicle is gathering about them. In 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) took effect and included geolocation within the definition of 'sensitive personal information,' opening up the possibility the CPRA could regulate AV data collection. Notably, the California Privacy Protection Agency has announced a review of data privacy practices of 'connected' vehicles, which have features like location sharing, smartphone integration, and cameras, signaling regulatory interest in this area. Another relevant California state law is the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), an anti-wiretapping and anti-eavesdropping statute that prohibits unauthorized interceptions of communications in order to protect the right of privacy.

"As AVs edge closer to widespread adoption, a number of public interest groups have begun to look at the unique challenges associated with child passengers. In 2018, the organization Safe Kids Worldwide created a Blue Ribbon Panel, Children in Autonomous Vehicles. The calls to action include increased safety standards, usability testing for families, inclusive design, appropriate supervision, and marketing safe transportation using restraints. Significantly, all of the Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendations focus on child safety rather than privacy. This narrow focus on physical safety is mirrored in much of the emerging literature, which tends to look at parents' attitudes and beliefs around AV safety for their children. Parents in particular have highlighted the need for more surveillance within the vehicle's cabin, including that a camera and microphone are requirements to their children to both monitor and communicate with their children. However, few studies have looked at children's attitudes, and none have focused specifically on children's privacy.",body_text,text,0.9953183520599251,22,36,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"As AVs evolve, children are likely to use them not only for transit, but as temporary extensions of home, school, and social life. For children commuting alone or spending significant time in transit, AVs may become spaces where they complete homework, communicate with friends, nap, change clothes for extracurriculars, or process personal emotions. Survey data reveals that individuals already regularly engage in a wide range of intimate activities within their vehicles-from routine behaviors like eating and communicating to more private activities such as sleeping, changing clothes, and engaging in sexual activities. AVs will only amplify this trend, and make cars even more dwelling-like by freeing up passengers from tasks related to driving. This shift toward treating vehicles as personal living spaces heightens the need for privacy protections. Privacy concerns affect all vehicle occupants, but they become particularly acute for children, whose developmental stage makes them especially vulnerable to privacy intrusions.

"As young people start to be alone in cars, safety concerns naturally arise for parents, car manufacturers, insurance companies, and government regulators. These concerns are legitimate. Some forms of in-cabin monitoring may not only be desirable, but necessary. For children who are unattended passengers, surveillance could assist in emergencies; for example, if the vehicle broke down and the child needed to call for help or was facing a medical emergency. Additionally, if a child is unattended, surveillance may help determine if the child is properly restrained during the journey. Surveillance could allow for automatic adjustment of safety systems based on passenger size and position and ensure the use of child safety restraints when appropriate.",body_text,text,1.0,24,39,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"In some cases, the impetus for surveillance extends beyond child-specific concerns. In-cabin monitoring can serve broader interests-to protect companies from vandalism, misuse, and other misbehavior by occupants. Surveillance may help mitigate these risks. Yet any safety benefits must be weighed against developmental costs. Adolescence is a critical period of identity formation and growing independence, historically supported by private spaces, and undermined by constant monitoring. Part II of this Essay explores two distinct but related surveillance dynamics: The first section of this Part addresses the harms of parental surveillance, while the second section considers harms beyond parents-harms from law enforcement and other third parties monitoring children. While treated separately here, parental and third-party surveillance are closely linked.

"AV surveillance does not just implicate spatial autonomy for youth, but control over their inner worlds-their thoughts and choices. Surveillance harms children's self-development during a time when they are particularly vulnerable. Yet today's young people face unprecedented surveillance across all domains of their lives.

"Increasingly, good parenting equals perpetual surveillance. Companies capitalize on parental anxieties about safety and success, suggesting that parents who don't embrace comprehensive monitoring technologies are somehow falling short of their duties, even though our children are not in greater danger, and in fact are far safer, than past generations.

"Constant monitoring of young people undermines developmental processes that require freedom from observation. These developmental processes include identity exploration, role experimentation, and the formation of a coherent self-concept. Privacy plays a crucial role in this process, as it provides adolescents with the space to experiment with different self-presentations and develop their unique identity away from constant adult scrutiny. This experimentation involves gradually taking on more responsibilities and making choices about their future, which requires a degree of freedom from parental control and often a shift in attachment to peers. Unfortunately, current research on teen technology often takes a misguided 'risk-centric' approach. But restricting children's participation in an effort to protect them may, ironically, lead to greater long-term risks. For children, surveillance instills a sense of mistrust and suspicion, conditions that can ultimately breed the very misbehavior that authorities are seeking to prevent. Children, feeling pre-judged as potential wrongdoers, may act out in rebellion against the very system meant to 'improve' their behavior.",body_text,text,0.9898305084745763,29,46,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"The car is also a conduit to spaces that children may not have parental support to access. Specifically, vehicles may be the way young people access reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare. For children in the LGBTQ+ community, transportation may be a lifeline to finding communities where they can find acceptance and support. As Professor Danielle Citron explains, children's intimate privacydefined as control over access to their 'bodies, minds, health, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and close relationships'-is fundamental to their ability to thrive. In this context, vehicles function not merely as transportation, but as tools of empowerment toward intimate privacy and resistance against oppressive circumstances.",body_text,text,0.9153689911983751,31,49,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"The loss of private space in vehicles not only undermines adolescents' development, it also opens the door to something more insidious: the systemic repurposing of children's data. Surveillance in AVs does not end with the gaze of a parent or the car company simply collecting information for safety; it becomes part of a larger infrastructure in which intimate details about a child's behavior, location, and associations can be retained, shared, and used in ways far removed from the original purpose. Monitoring for safety has its risks, but the harms go beyond these to policing, profiling, and punishment-especially for those who are already at the margins.",body_text,text,0.9939577039274925,32,50,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"Information collected to ensure child safety in AVs and maintain AV performance will inevitably find its way to secondary uses-a pattern well established across digital domains.

"Surveillance could also be used for new crimes that have emerged in the wake of Dobbs . Now, minors face increasing restrictions in accessing reproductive and gender-affirming health care. Location data from reproductive healthcare clinics has been targeted and sold by multiple data brokers.

"Once car companies generate this data, it develops a life of its own. The Supreme Court's decision in Carpenter v. United States, which has been interpreted narrowly by lower courts, offers little protection. In Carpenter , the Supreme Court grappled with the continued viability of the third-party doctrine, which traditionally held that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with third parties. The Court reconsidered this doctrine's application in the digital age and held that accessing a week's worth of cell location data requires a warrant, even though individuals shared this information with service providers who are third parties.

"Notice-and-choice frameworks, especially within families, create deep concerns that mirror the conflicts of interest we see in the criminal context. As scholars like Helen Nissenbaum have argued, privacy is not just individual but contextual and relational, and a notice-and-choice model ignores how data practices affect groups and social structures. Individual adults already demonstrate poor privacy decision-making for themselves-routinely accepting lengthy terms without reading them, misunderstanding the scope of the agreement, and consenting to arrangements they would reject if fully informed. Yet we rely on the parental control model that delegates children's privacy protections to parents, instead of creating substantive protections for children.

"Existing legal frameworks are inadequate to these concernsthey operate on a notice and choice basis, and rarely, if ever, consider how third parties can acquire children's data from AVs.

"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) exemplifies these limitations. Although COPPA imposes a parental consent requirement for children under thirteen, it adopts the conventional notice-and-choice approach-despite widespread evidence that such notices are just clicked through by parents. If most Americans accept online terms of service without reading them, the percentage is likely even higher among time-constrained parents. Similarly, in the educational arena, scholars like Professor Zahra Takhshid advocate moving away from the parental consent apparatus toward more robust privacy protections for children for these reasons. For educational technology, parents often face a false choice: consent to data collection or impede their child's educational access. AVs present parallel concerns-when the choice lies between vehicle access for essential activities or no access at all, meaningful consent regarding data collection does not exist.",body_text,text,0.9968814968814969,45,68,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"Rejecting surveillance altogether isn't realistic-or even desirable. As discussed at the outset of Part II, AVs need some monitoring in order to operate safely. The external cameras are integral to making sure the AV avoids collisions, and the internal surveillance can also be justified for safety, for example, making sure individuals are restrained.

"So far, we've relied on notice and choice. As long as individuals consent, companies are free to collect whatever they want. Some reformers have proposed improving this process-providing consumers more notice, creating friction before proceeding, making privacy notices more concise.

Unlike adults who can vote, lobby, or organize to protect their interests, children depend entirely on others to advocate for their rights. This dependence becomes an issue when their privacy conflicts with an adult protecting their own interests.

Such measures are the first step to protecting children's intimate privacy from exploitative secondary markets.",body_text,text,0.9978260869565218,56,84,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"Most privacy scholars focus on access and control of data, but retention and deletion are important elements as well. Even when AV companies collect data for legitimate safety purposes, retention of that data poses a serious threat to children's privacy. The longer intimate data is stored, the more opportunities exist for abuse, theft, and misuse. There is the threat of hacking, often revealing very private information about individuals. Additionally, sharing a child's data with police presents separate dangers that I have thoroughly documented in previous work. Given these harms, regulations should require that companies delete in-cabin recordings, location histories, and other sensitive information related to child passengers as soon as the immediate operational purpose has been served.",body_text,text,0.9987484355444305,57,86,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"Short retention limits are also key to prevent law enforcement abuses. Data for criminal investigations can be perpetually retained under current laws, with previously innocuous information revealing new insights in the future. This state of permanence stands in contrast to juvenile justice principles: While all states mandate juvenile record expungement or sealing, digital search data can persist indefinitely on law enforcement servers because most agencies lack data deletion policies. Without meaningful deletion policies, children face the risk of perpetual exposure, undermining their right to second chances and clean slates.",body_text,text,1.0,58,87,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"The rise of AVs offers unprecedented mobility for children, yet it also brings the potential for unprecedented surveillance. In-cabin monitoring, location tracking, and the sale of all that data combine to create a digital dossier of children's lives. Young people cannot understand, opt-out, or meaningfully control the AV data collected about them. Our legal frameworks fail to keep pace-not just because of legislative inertia, but because the privacy laws we do have are built on a flawed foundation: the notice-and-choice paradigm and parental consent.",body_text,text,0.7666068222621185,59,89,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"This Essay challenges that foundation. Children are not just extensions of their parents. Their privacy interests may be different. Surveillance, even when well intentioned, can undermine their developmental needs, chill exploration, and curb appropriate risktaking. For marginalized youth in particular, these risks are compounded by inequities that make surveillance not just invasive but punitive.",body_text,text,0.9987515605493134,60,90,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
"We must reorient privacy law to protect children as rightsholders in their own right. Until then, the cars that carry our children will continue to watch them-and worse, expose them-in ways they may not understand but will nonetheless feel.",body_text,text,0.9896049896049897,62,93,chicago_law_review_children-and-cars-watch-them
