"Antidemocratic forces rely on intimidation tactics to silence criticism and opposition. Recall how J. Edgar Hoover's FBI warned civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King that secret recordings of his extramarital affairs would be made public unless he committed suicide. 1 In the digital age, online abuse is a go-to intimidation tactic for authoritarians and their allies. For instance, pro-Kremlin trolls targeted Finnish journalist Jessikka Aro after she reported on proRussian online influence campaigns. 2 Posters doxed Aro and published her private health information; they accused her of being an American spy and a NATO lobbyist; she received threats via email and text. 3",body_text,text,0.9955882352941177,1,1,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"Today's intimidation playbook follows a two-step pattern. In the first step, as in Aro's case, authoritarian forces target critics with online abuse. In the second step, critics are falsely accused of engaging in online abuse. These false accusations allow the authoritarian to claim the mantle of victimhood. The second step represents a strategic escalation: by transforming victims into alleged perpetrators, authoritarians invite further online abuse against victims, compounding the harm. Under both steps, the real victims are critics of the powerful, who first experience harassment and then face gaslighting that incites additional abuse.",body_text,text,0.9969040247678018,2,2,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism

Musk shared posts naming four women working in climate-related government positions with dismissive comments suggesting their roles were unnecessary. In one post, Musk declared, 'So many fake jobs.' Predictably, some of his more than two hundred million followers then attacked the four women, posting abusive statements like 'Sorry Ashley Thomas. Gravy Train is over.'

"announced at a Texas rally that The Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos would 'have such problems' if he became President. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have explained that when 'important societal actors-university presidents, media outlets, C.E.O.s, mayors, governors-chang[e] their behavior in order to avoid the wrath of government, that's a sign that we've crossed the line into some form of authoritarianism.' The fear permeates society when others see officials attack perceived opponents online: 'People on both sides of the aisle who would normally be part of the public dialogue on big issues of the day say that they are intimidated by the prospect of online attacks from Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, concerned about harm to their companies and frightened for the safety of their families.' Indeed, Bezos himself announced in February 2025 that he would be taking more direct ideological control over The Washington Post to facilitate coverage more in line with President Trump's priorities.",body_text,text,0.8213498014997794,42,81,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"Society loses when women, journalists, and members of minority groups are silenced by online abuse. We lose not only their voices but also the alternative perspective those voices offer. We lose our own freedom of thought as the media ecosystem becomes more homogenous and conforms to the will of those in power. And we lose out on a politics inflected by diverse voices. Politics without room for dissent is fascistic.",body_text,text,1.0,43,82,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"Abuse and gaslighting have indirect effects on the psyches of their victims that make submission and conformity more likely. On both individual and social levels, abuse victims become disempowered and lose their capacity to resist their abusers.",body_text,text,1.0,44,84,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"For individual victims of physical and digital abuse, gaslighting creates a sense of confusion and self-doubt. It encourages victims to wonder whether they are in the wrong. That kind of psychological distortion is unnerving and creates a disempowering sense of bewilderment. It is especially powerful given what Professor Deborah Tuerkheimer has called the 'care gap,' or society's 'tendency to elevate the importance of [male] abusers' over female accusers. 19 Victims question their reality and become primed to accept the realities described to them by their harassers.",body_text,text,0.9676855895196507,45,85,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"A second effect is no less dangerous than the first. For individual victims, strategies like DARVO make victims of harassment believe that they cannot fight back and that their situation is hopeless. 20 Giving in appears to be the only option. 21 Escape seems impossible because, as several scholars have shown, the ability to recognize avenues for escape atrophies as emergency survival skills strengthen. 22 Similarly, inverting law aimed at disrupting traditional hierarchies of power to entrench those power dynamics erodes respect and faith in law and politics as even imperfect instruments of change. This inversion discourages political engagement and allows authoritarians to implement their agenda with little pushback from the population. Populations subject to authoritarian gaslighting go into survival mode just like their individual abuse victim analogs. They tune out and focus on their private worlds due to the very real incapacitation that comes from public engagement. This is precisely where authoritarians want the public: scared, docile, and focused inward.",body_text,text,0.9990723562152134,47,89,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"By claiming the mantle of victimhood, abusers situate themselves as the aggrieved party. Actual victims of abuse are worthy of sympathy and support, but abusers are not. 23 Abusers invert the narrative of abuse for social and communicative reasons. They adopt a position that others will find sympathetic because they need support and sympathy from their (mostly male) peers.

"This move is a critical part of campaigns to entrench authoritarian power. In a non-inverted world, as Mervi Pantti and Karin Wahl-Joergensen argue, 'anger and moral outrage on behalf of the suffering victims can be a powerful motivation for dissent and opposition when there is someone to blame for the injustice.' This is, in part, how long simmering anger among women and queer people about their treatment by heterosexual men in positions of power turned into a broad-based movement like #MeToo. Indignation and outrage about the behavior of abusers like Harvey Weinstein, Les Moonves, and Kevin Spacey take time but finally bubble over into action.",body_text,text,0.996937212863706,49,97,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"In a world inverted by the online abuse and gaslighting two-step approach, however, where the powerful are draped in the cloak of victimhood, indignation about injustice is redirected to support abusers and authoritarians. Media and communications scholar Lilie Chouliaraki, relying on sociological and psychology literatures, argues that the co-optation of victimhood weaponizes pain and the indignation that it generates. '[T]he distinction,' Chouliaraki argues, 'between pain as a systemic condition , or vulnerability, on the one hand, which defines our relative openness to violence in its various structural forms, . . . and pain as a linguistic claim , or victimhood,' is an important effect of authoritarian weaponization of victimhood. 24 Women, queer populations, and people of color face abuse and pain as a systemic condition.",body_text,text,0.974910394265233,50,98,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"That positionality opens these populations to disproportionate abuse online. Their claims to victimhood are legitimate and should be heard. But abusers and would-be authoritarians leverage the linguistic elements of victimhood without the underlying experience, generating and then channeling reactions of outrage and indignation-now directed toward the actual victim-in their favor. This reduces public discourse to competing claims of victimhood, a fight that the vulnerable rarely win. Chouliaraki adds: 'Those who are most vulnerable do not get to be heard. It is instead the pain of the powerful . . . that ends up mattering the most, and the communication of victimhood becomes, in this sense, not about vulnerability but about privilege.' In other words, gaslighters have voices that are far louder, more powerful, and more wide reaching; their claims to victimhood are more effective at marshalling popular indignation. It is through this",body_text,text,0.9396508728179551,51,99,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"We live in a dangerous inverted world. Abusers claim the mantle of victimhood while pummeling their victims with abuse. Would-be authoritarians are doing the same thing to the public. The powerful harass and silence dissidents, minoritized populations, journalists, protesters, and pro-democracy critics and then audaciously cry victim when anyone dares to push back.",body_text,text,1.0,52,103,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"Today, these authoritarian strategies have gone digital. The concept of online abuse has been misappropriated to shield antidemocratic actors from legitimate scrutiny and criticism while simultaneously enabling them to direct abuse towards critics. We are seeing this unfold in real time. As a presidential adviser and leader of an executive advisory panel, Elon Musk targeted relatively unknown female federal employees online, leading to cyber mob attacks on those women. When reporters questioned the credentials of the young men working for him in the federal government, Musk decried the reporting as online abuse, in turn sparking a campaign of online abuse against the reporter.",body_text,text,1.0,53,104,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
"Social media companies are eager allies in this authoritarian playbook, and not only those platforms owned by authoritarian politicians themselves. Independent platforms, all of which thrive on the kind of hyper-engagement generated by online harassment and abusive gaslighting, see dollars, not democracy dying. When the authoritarian two-step approach is aimed at anyone those in power do not like, it is democracy that ends up being the final victim.",body_text,text,1.0,54,105,chicago_law_review_digital-authoritarianism
