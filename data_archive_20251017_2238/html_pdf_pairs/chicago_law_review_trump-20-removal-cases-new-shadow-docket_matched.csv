"O.C.G. is a gay man who fled his home in Guatemala because of private death threats and official persecution. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rejected his petition for asylum and deported him back to Guatemala, from which O.C.G. fled to Mexico, where he was raped and held hostage. O.C.G. re-entered the United States; DHS officers issued a reinstatement-of-removal order against him, again designating Guatemala as the country of removal. On February 19, 2025, an Immigration Judge (IJ) granted his application for withholding of removal to Guatemala because his life would be at risk and for similar reasons refused to designate Mexico as a country of removal. Nonetheless, DHS put O.C.G. on a bus to Mexico, whose authorities sent him back to Guatemala .",body_text,text,0.9980430528375733,0,4,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Invoking the immigration statute and constitutional due process, O.C.G. and three detained immigrants brought a class action lawsuit for declaratory judgment that DHS must provide notice when it proposes a third country for removal and a meaningful hearing for the immigrant to raise asylum and/or risk-of-torture arguments against such country. On March 28, 2025, District Judge Brian Murphy granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), barring DHS from summary disregard of countries identified in removal orders. The next day, DHS promulgated a new policy: If a country made any 'credible' assurance that deported immigrants would not be 'persecuted or tortured,' then DHS will remove the immigrant to that country without notice. Without such assurances, the new policy assured immigrants of notice of the new country, but not of their rights to raise reasonable fear of torture or persecution, nor of sufficient time to prepare for a hearing if they asked for one.",body_text,text,0.9958720330237358,1,5,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Welcome to the Supreme Court's emergency docket. Like the Twilight Zone, the emergency docket is 'the middle ground between light and shadow,' and hence is the core of the so-called 'shadow docket.' Commentators have criticized the Court's shadow-docket interventions: summary orders shirk the Court's responsibility to resolve important legal issues in reasoned opinions informed by complete briefing and oral argument, are unwise because they risk premature decisionmaking before issues percolate in the lower courts, provide insufficient or confusing direction for lower courts, and undermine the Court's legitimacy because of their 'shadowy' deliberation. Some critics suggest that the shadow docket is a sneaky way for conservative Justices named by Republican presidents to carry out their regime-change agenda without creating too much publicity. 2 My big problem is that shadow-docket stays deeply (not just technically) undermine the rule of law and violently affect the lives of people like O.C.G. without sufficient legal justification.",body_text,text,0.9541547277936963,3,9,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket

Unlike its shadow docket veto of several important Biden Administration measures responding to the genuine COVID emergency, the Court in 2025 entered stays allowing important measures to go forward, notwithstanding legality problems and trumped-up claims of 'emergency.'

The dominant theme was regime change upending landmark statutory schemes and longstanding and mostly bipartisan policies. The primary mechanism was removal : the removal of undocumented immigrants such as O.C.G. to either their home countries or, increasingly, last-minute third countries; the removal of tens of thousands of federal employees through reduction-in-force discharges; and removal of agency officials whose jobs were guaranteed by statutory for-cause protections.",body_text,text,0.9991889699918897,10,20,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket

"In O.C.G.'s case, DHS v. D.V.D. (US 2025), the Court granted an emergency stay of a preliminary injunction requiring the DHS to provide due process to immigrants before sending them to possibly dangerous countries. Another immigration issue created more problems for Trump 2.0. The President invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to summarily remove dozens of Venezuelans (almost all in the United States legally) to third countries on the ground that they were allegedly members of a criminal gang invading the United States. By an administrative mistake, DHS deported Kilmer Abrego Garcia (not a gang member) to El Salvador, where he was held in the notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison. In Noem v. Garcia, the Court substantially rejected the Government's application for an emergency stay and confirmed the district court's order for DHS to 'facilitate' Garcia's release from hell-prison and return to the United States, where Trump 2.0 sought to deport him to Uganda, then Eswatini, an effort unresolved as we go to press on September 23, 2025. The next month, in A.A.R.P. v. Donald Trump , a 7-2 Court granted an emergency stay to Venezuelans scheduled to be removed to third countries; the per curiam opinion barred DHS from detaining or removing these persons without notice and a meaningful hearing on the issue of their gang membership.

In Trump v. Casa, Inc.

"The biggest short-term removal since World War II has been the mass discharges of federal employees.

Under the supervision of the Office Management & Budget (OMB) and the ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), different agencies discharged large numbers of employees. In Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) , an 8-1 Court granted an emergency stay to allow Trump 2.0 agencies to formulate final RIF plans that could then be reviewed.

As they did in Casa , the nationwide injunction case, the 6-3 majority can choose the occasions where they turn an emergency stay issue into a complete Article III production, and they can leave the other occasions to resolution by one-paragraph, unsigned orders. Admittedly, this new development in the shadow docket is a product of a unique confluence of (1) regime change aggressively pursued by Trump 2.0, (2) which is viewed with alarm by most lower court judges, (3) but not by the block of six GOP-appointed Justices who have constituted a relatively stable Supreme Court majority.

The long-prevailing rule for appellate stays started with a presumption against them except in 'emergencies' and then required the moving party to show that (1) it was likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal, (2) it would be irreparably injured by denying the stay, (3) the balance of equities (harm if the stay were granted versus harm if it were not) tipped decisively in favor of the stay, and (4) the public interest supported the stay. In the new shadow docket, the first factor (previously considered the most important) has faded or sometimes disappeared, and the last three have been revised to reflect massive deference to presidential preferences.

These arguments have a distinguished lineage, as they were celebrated by the late Professor Alexander Bickel as 'passive virtues' that enabled the judiciary (Bickel's 'least dangerous branch') to avoid thorny political entanglements and premature judgments of law through cautious process. There is a thin line between a passive virtue and a passive vice, and it is a line that has been obliterated in the Trump 2.0 removal cases.

Every premise of the conclusion was questionable and required further analysis: Ludecke held that courts must be available to evaluate claims about the AEA's interpretation, the AEA explicitly vests American courts with jurisdiction to order removal but only with 'sufficient cause,' and the AEA is a different statutory scheme than the Immigration Act of 1917, which had been enacted against a background of executive discretion in immigration-admission decisions.

And Trump 2.0's seizure of Congress's spending power by withholding statutory payments to public schools and science research centers, the 5-4 Court has ruled, cannot be challenged wholesale under the APA but must be litigated, payment by payment, as refunds under Tucker Act proceedings in the Court of Claims.",body_text,text,0.9959058341862845,39,58,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President is supposed to 'take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.' The relevant 'laws' are statutes enacted by Congress. When Presidents seem to be shirking their take Care duties, Congress has given federal courts jurisdiction and statutory causes of action to engage in judicial review so that the executive branch can be accountable and statutory schemes can be preserved. The new shadow docket undermines both accountability and statutory schemes for indefinite periods of time, in most cases with little or no statutory analysis by the Court.",body_text,text,0.993421052631579,40,59,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket

"Schmitt argued that courts (fearful of political discipline) would go along, and the Roberts Court has exceeded the most ambitious Schmittian fantasy. In Trump v. United States (2024), the Court created black holes for the President when acting under his muchexpanded core Article II authority and presumptive black holes for other official presidential acts, vaguely defined. Predictably, President Trump has behaved with less sense of legal constraint in his second term than he did during his first term. And when federal district judges have called out Trump 2.0 directives and policies on statutory or constitutional grounds, emergency stays have allowed the administration to continue those policies, usually with little or no assurance that they are legal. And the GOP majority on the Court has said virtually nothing about the lawless acts of the executive branch, while demonizing lower court judges who are actually studying the statutes and trying to enforce the primacy of Congress.",body_text,text,0.9994972347913524,42,64,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Because emergency stays are in place for the duration of the trial court litigation and on active appeal, the Trump 2.0 lawyers have every incentive to draw things out-which allows them to ignore the law for long periods of time. In D.V.D. , for example, before the Supreme Court had stayed its preliminary injunction, the district court had required DHS to provide a CAT hearing to eight immigrants being held in Djibouti, a country in east Africa, before they could be sent to South Sudan, a dangerous country eight-hundred miles due west. When the district court tried to protect the eight from an illegal removal to South Sudan, the Solicitor General returned to the Supreme Court, where a 7-2 majority ruled that the stay applied to the eight convicted felons. Because this was a putative class actionwhose certification the Government opposed-the stay had a broad effect, insulating Trump 2.0 from any judicial supervision of the baitand-switch game it has been playing with third-country removals. On Independence Day 2025, DHS delivered all eight 'barbaric criminal aliens' (according to its press release) to South Sudan, where their fate is uncertain.",body_text,text,0.9944037882049075,43,65,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"From the perspective of Trump 2.0, delay serves another purpose, as it gives the White House time to defenestrate structures that would administer the due process the Supreme Court sometimes requires. Recall that IJs listened to O.C.G. and treated him lawfully. But IJs can be replaced at will by the Attorney General, who in the first half of 2025 fired a leading IJ and dozens of other Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys based upon apparently partisan or other nonprofessional reasons. The DOJ lawyer who admitted that Kilmer Abrego Garcia had been removed to El Salvador by mistake was fired-and he has testified that DOJ attorneys were pressured to mislead judges and evade court orders.

"Among the prohibited practices is 'arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.'

"In February 2025, the White House removed Cathy Harris (the only Democrat) from the MSPB. Because Harris was an adjudicative official, Trump 2.0 was challenging not only Humphrey's Executor , but also Wiener v. United States (1958), which held that presidents could not remove judges of the War Claims Commission, because its adjudicatory role required strict impartiality. With no mention of either Humphrey's or Wiener, the Court on May 22, 2025, granted an emergency stay in Trump v. Wilcox . Almost six weeks later, the Court granted an emergency stay allowing Trump 2.0 to remove three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In Trump v. Boyle , the 6-3 majority chided lower courts for continuing to follow",body_text,text,0.9305645684620376,48,71,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Wiener remains unmentioned in the shadow docket cases, but its overruling would be especially significant because tenure protection for quasi-judicial officials (like Harris) not only serves statutory goals (a merit-based civil service) but also constitutional due process requirements. The Government cannot deprive federal employees of their job interests without (1) notice and (2) a meaningful hearing (3) before an impartial decisionmaker. For adjudicators such as those on the MSPB, impartiality is not just a policy goal, but a constitutional requirement-and White House capture of the Board would explode the appearance of impartiality. By the way, that insight also underwrites the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA), which has (as amended) created the administrative law judge as a key figure in the Social Security Administration and other agencies. So add the APA and the Social Security Act as statutes the Supreme Court probably slighted or ignored in considering the emergency stay in Harris's case.",body_text,text,0.9980430528375733,49,73,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"At the same time immigrants and agency officials have been illegally removed, tens of thousands of federal employees have been subject to reductions in force that may violate the CRSA and will surely eviscerate statutory schemes, even if less completely than has already been accomplished with the Education Department. Emergency stays have been granted to push pause on lower court orders protecting against mass civil servant removals. As noted above, tens of thousands of federal employees have been terminated, some for apparently partisan reasons that would violate CSRA. Effective protection against a spoils system requires, at a minimum, an appeals process that would neutrally apply the CSRA policy, principles, and specific rules. But if a President can reconstitute the board at will, the system Congress established in the CRSA and that assures due process and respect for law is virtually meaningless.",body_text,text,1.0,50,74,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"There is also a meta-philosophical angle for this concern. 'Legal interpretation,' Bob Cover taught us, 'takes place in a field of pain and death.' This is because law is coercive and therefore backed up by lawenforcement violence. 'Legal interpretive acts signal and occasion the imposition of violence upon others: A judge articulates her understanding of a text, and as a result, somebody loses his freedom, his property, his children, even his life,' as was the case for thirty-six death-row inmates whose emergency stays were denied in the 2024 Term.

"particular is to require law-based justification when the government engages in coercive acts such as removals. And when courts generally and the Supreme Court in particular veto, delay, or confirm governmental coercion and violence, they must provide law-based justifications.

"What should be done? And what might the Court do, as it moves forward? For starters, the Court ought to apply its 'major questions doctrine' to emergency stays. If the President or an agency is making a big move with major consequences and lower courts carefully justify preliminary relief against probably unlawful action, the Court's presumption in favor of an emergency stay should either be nullified (no presumption) or even reversed (as the Court did with President Biden's COVID policies). And the Court ought to take seriously the equitable factors traditionally required for any kind of stay-and count statutory policies created by Congress as a significant factor that will often counterbalance executive policies favored by the White House.",body_text,text,0.9933422103861518,60,86,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Second, probability of success on the merits is a requirement that ought to be taken seriously for emergency stays. If the majority are exercising their supervisory authority as a 'court,' they must do so through 'judgment' and actual legal reasoning. Justice Barrett worries that the Court will be perceived as a 'bunch of partisan hacks,' a charge she believes unfounded. That charge hangs in the air every time the Court imposes its will on the lower courts, without legal explanation that can pass for a law-based judgment. The more important the issue, the greater the requirement of legal reasoning.",body_text,text,0.9487603305785124,61,87,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
"Third, the Court ought to reconsider its neo-Hayekian commitment to piecemeal rather than collective litigation. Admittedly, this is both the hardest and the most important ask, because the six majority Justices seem existentially committed to individual rather than group litigation. When important public policies and serious constitutional or statutory issues are in play, piecemeal litigation plus emergency stays risk the perseverance of lawless executive actions for the duration of a presidential term-which is precisely the Cohnian strategy of deny, attack, delay. The current Court sometimes addresses this problem effectively, as illustrated by its orders in the Abrego Garcia and other AEA cases. Writing strong opinions (with reasons) rebuking unlawful actions and allowing classwide relief are mechanisms that a textualist, original public meaning Court ought to engage more often.",body_text,text,0.9988814317673378,62,88,chicago_law_review_trump-20-removal-cases-new-shadow-docket
