"The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, it must compensate the property owner. 1 One exception to this rule, the 'background principles' exception, establishes that 'the government does not take a property interest when it merely asserts a 'pre-existing limitation upon the land owner's title.'' 2 For instance, if a landowner is creating a nuisance on his property, the government owes him no compensation for forcing him to stop, 'because he never had the right to engage in the nuisance in the first place.' 3 The concept is simple: One cannot lose what was never his. 4",body_text,text,0.9831288343558282,0,1,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property
"Background principles are a strong medicine. 5 When a court analyzes a takings claim, it must first identify the property interest at issue before deciding the more complex, discretionary question of whether that property was 'taken.' 6 Background principles are 'logically antecedent' to this analysis, 7 meaning that they can foreclose an aggrieved property owner's claim before the first step. 8 If the court determines that, pursuant to a background principle, a plaintiff had no property interest to begin with, the government will completely evade takings liability for its interference with the plaintiff's property. 9 Judges, too, can use background principles to avoid difficult legal and factual questions that may arise later in the takings analysis. 10",body_text,text,0.961892247043364,1,2,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

"Lucas 's focus on state-specific law for defining background principles was consistent with the Court's understanding throughout most of the twentieth century that the word 'property' in the Fifth Amendment had no inherent federal meaning. 73 During this period, the Court adhered to the notion that the Constitution references property rights, but that those rights are generally created and defined by state law. 74 As the Court explained in Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth , 75 '[p]roperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.

"In practice, however, the general law method seems unlikely to function as a one-way ratchet increasing property rights. This Part argues that the general law of property could come back to bite those who support expansive property protections. Specifically, property interests could be underprotected by general property law's interaction with the background principles exception. To this end, this Part discusses two recent decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals that seized on Tyler 's general law approach to identify jurisdictionless background principles that foreclosed aggrieved property owners' takings claims. These cases illustrate three features of jurisdictionless background principles that may systematically limit Takings Clause protections: First, general law tends to be over inclusive of background principles, as it necessitates a high level of generality. Second, placing the burden on plaintiffs to preempt background principles biases outcomes in the government's favor. Third, general law approaches are incompatible with the requirement that background limitations inhere in a property owner's title itself.",body_text,text,0.9946996466431095,32,186,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property

Baker and Slaybaugh illustrate that the general law approach, because it is fundamentally an exercise in abstraction, can result in more expansive background limitations on property rights (and therefore less property protection).

That general law background principles would be more abstract than statespecific ones is intuitive: When courts attempt to analyze the laws of jurisdictions in times and places near and far, a higher level of generality is needed to make those disparate laws all cognizable as part of a single, all-encompassing background principle.

"This generality problem is also systemic, in that it inheres in the sources central to Cedar Point 's general law approach. Although the Restatements in which Cedar Point , Baker , and Slaybaugh found background principles are useful sources for studying a given body of law's general principles, they are written at a high level of abstraction and thus do not encompass any single jurisdiction's nuanced common law. 170 Meanwhile, a more particularized inquiry into state law requires reckoning with the nuts and bolts of state statutes and common law. 171 If one concedes that increased abstraction leads to less property protection in the background-limitations context, then the courts' use of generalized sources of law only supports the conclusion that a takings doctrine based on jurisdictionless background principles poses the endemic risk of underprotecting property.",body_text,text,0.9903023388476897,48,265,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property
The hallmark of many background principles opinions has been that they offer 'little explanation' of how background principles actually apply to the facts at bar. 172 Baker and Slaybaugh fit into this trend. 173 And using general law to define background principles only worsens this problem. Reliance on general law sources further heightens the level of generality at which courts describe background principles and therefore 'leave[s] . . .

"property into 'a second-class right.'' 175 In other individual rights contexts, the burden typically falls on the government to point to a historical analogue that justifies a regulation burdening constitutional rights. 176 By contrast, both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits placed the burden on the respective plaintiffs to show a 'historical or contemporary authority that involves facts close[] to those at bar and where the petitioner succeeded under the Takings Clause.' 177 This burden's origin is unclear. Perhaps it stems naturally from the fact that background principles are antecedent to the takings analysis, such that the burden falls on the plaintiff to establish that they had a property interest in the first place. More cynically, it could be the result of the courts' squeamishness toward making definitive statements about history in these cases, so as to preserve 'flexibility' for future cases, 178 conceal operative normative judgments, 179 or avoid getting the answer wrong. 180 On this understanding, background rules would only appear categorical, but judges would exercise discretion in individual cases to determine whether a plaintiff's showing of history is 'close enough.' In any case, by burdening plaintiffs to disprove the applicability of background limitations instead of requiring the government to prove a necessity defense these early general law cases demonstrate a bias that undercuts property protections.",body_text,text,0.9297082228116711,50,275,harvard_law_review_Background_Principles_And_The_General_Law_Of_Property
