"International investment law provides stability for investors, helps capital flow across the globe, and can be a critical tool for sustainable development. This regime, however, has become increasingly controversial, in part due to its inability to reconcile investor obligations with competing human rights obligations. International investment treaties provide substantive guarantees to investors, including submission to binding arbitration in the event of breach. When found in breach of one of these guarantees, international investment arbitral tribunal awards are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially creating 'regulatory chill' for states that may otherwise take affirmative action to protect human rights out of concern that regulation may run afoul of their treaties' international investment provisions.",body_text,text,0.9964071856287425,1,21,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"Some legal scholars have posited a fiduciary theory of statehood, whereby a state owes a fiduciary duty to its people, much like that in domestic corporate law. This Note proposes looking to the fiduciary theory of statehood for a path forward. It then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders). The fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime. This framework offers a timely, pragmatic solution as the international community actively reconsiders the balance between investor protection and state sovereignty.",body_text,text,1.0,2,22,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"In addition to being resource-rich, the area held cultural significance for the Indigenous Aymara people. 3 When approving the environmental and social impact assessment, the Peruvian authorities instructed Bear Creek to set up community participation mechanisms. 4 Of the more than thirty distinct communities that the project would impact, Bear Creek worked with only four. 5 Bear Creek 'did not understand the Aymaras and . . . their communal relations.' 6 Experts believed that the Aymara people who participated in the outreach program were forced to attend and 'offer tacit approval.' 7 Furthermore, all community outreach programs were conducted in Spanish, and not the Aymara community's native language. 8",body_text,text,0.8268551236749117,4,28,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"When human rights obligations conflict with investor rights, IIAs can be more clearly interpreted by understanding the state as a fiduciary. The fiduciary theory of sovereignty logically follows from a modern understanding of states' rights to exercise sovereign authority. 73 It provides a framework through which international investment law can be reconciled with a state's rights and obligations to protect its population's human rights. By recognizing the state as a fiduciary, stakeholders-such as treaty drafters, investors, and arbitrators-can better understand the nature of a state's authority when negotiating and entering into IIAs. Furthermore, this theory clarifies that IIAs cannot be interpreted in a way that puts a domestic population's human rights in conflict with a foreign investor's rights under an IIA.",body_text,text,0.7932038834951456,26,130,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"The fiduciary theory has numerous potential means of adoption. It can be implemented through the contractual approach, which informs how specific treaty provisions in next-generation IIAs are drafted. This approach suggests that states should explicitly incorporate the fiduciary theory into new IIAs going forward. The fiduciary theory can also be incorporated into the judicial approach, which focuses on the interpretation of existing treaties. The judicial approach advocates for arbitrators to consider the fiduciary theory when interpreting IIAs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it can inform how practitioners think about international investment law and ISDS as a whole through the atmospheric approach. This approach, the most abstract of the three, encourages the diffusion and norm-casting of the fiduciary theory among key stakeholders using academic publications, amicus curiae submissions, country statements, and so on. Because IIAs are vast agreements, foreign investor behavior can have massive implications on crucial human rights issues-from the right to water to the right to nondiscrimination in the workplace. As already discussed, this regime is adrift when it comes to reconciling this fundamental tension.

"state's authority. The fiduciary theory can illuminate the scope of these constraints. With the fiduciary theory's clarification, the investor can better understand-and reasonably expect-what the state can, and more importantly, cannot contract away through an IIA. At its core, the fiduciary theory is about the nature of a state's sovereignty. Sovereignty is not a blank check to exercise illimitable power. Instead, it is collective power bestowed by that state's citizenry to ensure they can exercise inalienable rights. Consequently, contracting away the power to regulate in protection of a population's human rights through an IIA is clearly outside the bounds of a state's valid exercise of sovereignty. 134",body_text,text,0.8778960551033187,60,241,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

Whether through treaty provisions, judicial interpretation, or a complete reimagining of the system's architecture, the atmospheric approach demands an interrogation of the entire regime.",body_text,text,0.9960238568588469,76,290,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"As mentioned in Section III.C, these approaches incentivize investors to identify and respect human rights obligations to avoid triggering a state's mandatory role as a fiduciary. Part of the reason that this regime emerged in the first place was to invite investment in foreign jurisdictions by providing investors the stability they needed. The fiduciary theory provides this same stability by creating clear boundaries that must be respected, lest the state be required to intervene.",body_text,text,0.9979423868312757,79,303,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"Additionally, the ad hoc nature of these arbitrations can impact how arbitrators view their roles and subsequently how they rule. Tribunals emphasizing a lawmaking role are more likely to take larger public policy considerations into account. 176 By contrast, tribunals emphasizing a dispute-settling role tend to account less for these policy considerations. 177 In ISDS, arbitrators may emphasize the resolution of the present dispute and downplay big picture issues, such as the protection of human rights.",body_text,text,0.9844660194174757,84,313,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law

"With this framework in mind, the fiduciary theory will influence tribunals less focused on public policy in their consideration of human rights obligations. Arbitrators do not need to guess at the ideal policy outcomes when balancing a domestic population's human rights against an investor's rights. Instead, the legal framework is clear. The state, as a fiduciary, has no ability to contract away the power to protect its population. Any interpretation to the contrary invalidates the agreement due to breach of the fiduciary duty. So long as a human rights interest is identified, this duty-obligation defense is accessible to the state. Just as a domestic commercial arbitrator or judge can identify breaches of fiduciary duties in corporate disputes, an international investment arbitrator is equally capable.",body_text,text,0.8610816542948038,85,323,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"Although packaging a theory of human rights prioritization in private law concepts may lead to wider adoption by arbitrators, other actors may not readily embrace the fiduciary theory due to the current ad hoc system's incentives. This is not to say that the theory is without value.

"Skeptics of the fiduciary theory may point to the perverse incentives and systemic resistance of arbitrators, but this takes for granted that the system will remain in its current form. Instead, it appears increasingly clear that this system must transform to survive. The latter two vehicles for the fiduciary theory, the judicial and atmospheric frameworks, would particularly complement this change in regime. All the judiciary approach requires to become actionable is amenable arbitrators, which will be more readily available with a standing court of arbitration. Arbitrators not beholden to certain types of parties will be more free to consider the public policy implications of their decisions. The adoption of the atmospheric approach by these arbitrators during this lead-up period will be transformative. It is more important than ever to disseminate theoretical frameworks through which stakeholders can understand and prioritize human rights obligations. Even if those who adopt the theory are not the arbitrators of today, they may be sitting on the bench tomorrow.",body_text,text,1.0,88,331,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"At its best, international investment law can facilitate economic growth, connect economies across the globe, and help states attract investment for particular industries to enhance economic resilience. 184 This regime can be a tool for good, but it is fundamentally undermined by its complicated relationship with human rights. Human rights are not for sale. Nor are they a bargaining chip at the negotiating table. Instead, the protection of a citizenry's human rights is a state's raison d'être. Bear Creek v. Peru , Suez v. Argentina , and Eco Oro v. Colombia are important reminders of how international investment law can fail those people and purposes it is meant to serve. Frustration is growing, and there is a real danger that this system will cease to be viable if these fundamental failures continue.",body_text,text,0.938527084601339,89,333,michigan_law_review_citizen_shareholders_the_state_as_a_fiduciary_in_international_investment_law
"By approaching international investment law with the fiduciary theory of sovereignty in mind, the regime's purpose to protect its investors' interests can be reconciled with the state's obligation to protect its population's human rights.
