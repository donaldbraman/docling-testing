"Notice and comment is a public participation process, first articulated in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that was heralded at the time as a critical innovation to engage the general population in the administrative agency rulemaking process. It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases-primarily at the circuit court level-which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",body_text,text,0.9979423868312757,1,21,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking
"This Note offers agencies a solution already enshrined in the APA that would not require the exceedingly impracticable legislative action many proposed solutions rely on. The existing statutory tool-the good cause exception to notice and comment in section 553 of the APA-should be paired with a series of public engagement tools that are already available to agencies. Unlike notice and comment, these engagement methods are minimally resource-intensive and adapted to existing twenty-first century technologies. This approach preserves meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process while addressing many of the problems apparent in notice and comment without introducing new legislation, explicitly overruling any Supreme Court jurisprudence, or imposing new resource challenges on agencies.",body_text,text,0.9975155279503105,2,22,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking
"* J.D. Candidate, May 2026, University of Michigan Law School. Thank you to Professor Nicholas Bagley and Professor Nina Mendelson for their invaluable feedback on this Note and my ideas. This Note would not be possible without the smart and thoughtful edits from the Vol. 124 Notes Office: Luke Pomrenke, Haley Rogers, Dustin Smith, Ruben Piñuelas, Jacob León, and Suji Kim. I would not be here without the support (read: willingness to listen to me rant about niche admin law musings at all hours) of Heather Foster, Henry Evans, Nathan Pitock, Daniel Kaylor, and Madeline Guth, as well as my mom, my dad, and my sister. Finally, although the views expressed in this publication do not reflect those of anyone else who worked at the U.S. Department of Commerce during my time there, I would not have made it to Michigan Law, let alone published this piece, without the brilliant minds I met in the Biden Administration, most of all former Deputy Secretary Don Graves.",body_text,footnote,1.0,62,23,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"This Note considers existing issues with public participation in the informal rulemaking process and proposes a solution that combines the statutory good cause exception with the functional implementation of public engagement methods inspired by the Biden Administration. Part I provides an overview of the existing tools for public participation in the rulemaking process, namely notice and comment; the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); and off-the-record consultation between senior agency officials and their industry contacts, what this Note refers to as 'Rolodex Rulemaking.' Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders' involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.",body_text,text,0.9978386167146974,6,40,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking
"There is clear value to public participation in the rulemaking process. To the extent administrative agencies, despite being labeled by some as the 'fourth branch of government,' 12 are an extension of the democratically elected president and the executive branch, those same citizens who elect their president should have a voice in agency actions. What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts' current expectations. The statutory requirements of notice and comment are minimal; however, case law has expanded those requirements beyond what is feasible for agencies today and beyond what the drafters of the APA envisioned.",body_text,text,0.9337121212121212,7,42,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"Nested in section 553 of the APA is a tactic rarely discussed in notice-andcomment legal scholarship. Good cause rulemaking refers to the exception articulated in the APA that allows an agency to forgo notice and comment 'when the agency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.' 75 The exception has been invoked and litigated in a number of lower court cases, 76 but the exact meaning of 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest' has not been addressed by the Supreme Court, 77 leaving it unclear exactly when agencies can use the good cause exception. 78 Given the challenges with notice and comment, the issue seems ripe for review. However, even if the Court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking. They should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself. A twofold approach-good cause rulemaking combined with practicable, modern means of public engagement-has a chance of surviving judicial scrutiny.",body_text,text,0.7716303708063567,38,155,michigan_law_review_good_cause_for_goodness_sake_a_new_approach_to_notice_and_comment_rulemaking

"The final prong, ongoing engagement during implementation, has obvious benefits, although it does not directly correspond with any requirement under traditional notice and comment. The Biden Administration approached this prong as an opportunity to meet with 'community organizations and data users to discuss the various changes . . . and to ensure that stakeholders understand' how a new rule or regulation works. 96 These engagement efforts could mirror the listening sessions, town halls, and direct outreach that take place during rulemaking. But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA's original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers' lives simpler.
