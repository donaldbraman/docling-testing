"You can't question a secret you haven't been told. The criminal legal system depends on fair and open proceedings to expose and regulate unlawful and unconstitutional police conduct through the courts. If police can use claims of secrecy to systematically thwart criminal defendants' access to evidence, judicial review will fail. And yet that is exactly what is happening under a common-law doctrine called the 'law enforcement privilege.' The privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while withholding information from the defense about how those methods work. It risks perpetuating unconstitutional conduct, enabling wrongful convictions, and rendering Fourth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Brady , and statutory discovery laws moot. At the same time, it has a non-frivolous policy rationale. If all police investigative methods were public information, then more people committing crimes could evade detection.",body_text,text,0.9943093636833937,1,18,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"How can a better balance be struck? This Article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: The policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. The Article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.",body_text,text,1.0,2,19,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"And yet, that is exactly what is happening under an obscure but powerful common-lawdoctrine called the 'law enforcement privilege.' This evidentiary privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while concealing how those methods work from the defendants against whom they are used. The privilege is designed to apply to methods that would become ineffective if generally known. It is a qualified privilege, meaning that courts first decide whether the privilege applies and then balance the competing interests in secrecy and disclosure in any given case. 5 Though not always invoked and not always upheld, the privilege has been cited in over eleven hundred federal opinions in the past forty years and has almost certainly successfully concealed police conduct in many more discovery disputes that did not culminate in written opinions. 6",body_text,text,0.8946808510638298,5,23,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"These landmark rulings, and many more like them, have defined the modern Fourth Amendment. None of them would exist if the police conduct at issue had been secret. If police had concealed their warrant fraud, trespassory wiretapping, cell phone searches, and bulk location tracking from these defendants, these tactics could have continued indefinitely. The criminal legal system depends on fair and open proceedings to expose and regulate unlawful and unconstitutional police conduct through the courts.

The law enforcement privilege risks entrenching investigative methods and forms of evidence that are flawed or inaccurate by preventing defendants from putting them to the test. The privilege (like privileges generally) applies to every stage of a case, from pretrial suppression motions to post-conviction proceedings. 40 Hence, the privilege can block adversarial scrutiny of investigative methods even when the results of those methods are introduced as part of the government's case-in-chief at trial. It is worth emphasizing this point: The privilege is not just an issue at suppression hearings; it also reaches substantive evidence of guilt or innocence. When the results of a method are ultimately introduced at trial, the method veers from investigative to forensic. 41 In such circumstances, the law enforcement privilege still applies.

It begins by debunking the current scholarly consensus that there was no privilege for law enforcement methods at common law. That view is almost certainly wrong and invites a naïve underestimation of the privilege's intractability. Next, Part III considers prior arguments that the privilege should be abolished entirely or should not apply to information possessed by private entities.

"technologies that police generally use solely for investigative leads. 98 For instance, consider police use of internet monitoring software to identify computers that appear to be sharing digital contraband. Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect's home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant with possession . But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge of distribution at trial. 99 When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in a Daubert or Frye admissibility hearing. Alternately, defendants may seek information about the reliability or functional characteristics of the software to prepare for cross-examination at trial. 100 Or perhaps knowing how the software functions could help to identify evidence of innocence, such as a recurring query that initially identifies contraband and then shortly thereafter provides a null result indicating rapid deletion and tending to negate mens rea . Whether for an admissibility challenge, cross-examination, or evidence of innocence, accessing information about how, and how well, an investigative or forensic technology works can be essential to provide an effective defense. 101 In all of these circumstances, defendants' rights to access, scrutinize, and contest the evidence against them are essential to reduce wrongful convictions, serve dignitary and legitimacy interests in criminal proceedings, surface unconstitutional or unlawful surveillance practices, and more generally facilitate judicial review of law enforcement conduct. 102",body_text,text,0.7691309987029832,30,165,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Instead, a combination of baseline criminal procedure rules and privilege law mitigate the graymail risk. The baseline criminal procedure rules do so in part by placing strict limits on defendants' affirmative rights to compel access to information. Importantly, defendants cannot compel access to irrelevant information. Criminal discovery rules require defendants to show that any documents or data they seek from the government are 'material to preparing the defense,' 106 meaning the information has 'more than . . . some abstract logical relationship to the issues in the case' and would enable them 'significantly to alter the quantum of proof in [their] favor.' 107 Criminal subpoenas require defendants to identify information with specificity and to establish in advance that the information is likely to be both relevant and admissible at trial. 108 And judges have broad discretion to deny harassing or frivolous discovery motions. 109 If these rules function correctly, defendants will only ever be able to compel access to information about law enforcement investigative methods that is likely to be relevant to their case-even if no privilege applies.",body_text,text,0.8768060836501901,32,176,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Given this history, the basic worry is that the law enforcement privilege will be used to conceal too much. For instance, courts have declined to categorically refute claims that the privilege shields the type of batteries used in an audio recording device, 131 or 'the charts, graphs, and raw data' generated during a polygraph examination. 132 Shielding this type of information from adversarial scrutiny can enable tragic misconduct. Consider that, in July 2023, the Third Circuit found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a detective fabricated polygraph evidence, which led to an innocent man's wrongful eleven-year prison sentence. 133 A privilege sweeping enough to encompass polygraph data can prevent that type of misconduct from ever coming to light. Yet critics have complained that courts 'apply the privilege broadly to prohibit disclosure of information about all manner of technology, even techniques that are decades old and well known to anyone who has ever watched a police procedural,' 134 and that judges accept claims to the privilege at face value without demanding robust proof that disclosing an investigative method would in fact entail a risk of evasion. 135",body_text,text,0.7869507323568575,38,210,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

Some circuits have merely reiterated the broad policy rationale, which Jonathan Manes has termed 'the anti-circumvention argument for secrecy.' 173 For instance, the initial Second Circuit case to recognize a distinct law enforcement privilege by that name, In re Department of Investigation , explained that the privilege's purpose is 'to prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures,' 174 but provided no further subject-matter requirements for the privilege to attach and no procedural requirements for claimants to assert it. 175 The court did not revisit the privilege until 2010, at which point it held that the privilege applies to 'law enforcement techniques and procedures' 176 if disclosure 'risks undermining important [police] investigatory procedures,' 177 but offered no additional constraints.

In the absence of empirical evidence that publicity would or would not aid countermeasures, which is exceedingly hard to obtain, 195 plausible arguments exist on both sides of the issue.

Practically speaking, what limits threshold claims to the law enforcement privilege under current doctrine may be simply the logistical difficulty of deploying a method while keeping it secret.

Prosecutors facing disclose-ordismiss dilemmas might withdraw more criminal charges, maintaining secrecy by allowing alleged perpetrators of dangerous crimes to return to the community where they could harm future victims. Judges might 'bend' the rules of evidence to deny discovery based on irrelevance. 249 And police might rely more on the parallel construction technique of conducting an initial investigation with secret methods followed by a second to re-discover evidence using alternate, public methods, leaving courts, prosecutors, and defendants alike unaware that any secret exists at all. 250 In contrast, keeping the privilege as a lawful avenue for justified secrecy could make parallel construction appear all the more unreasonable and encourage judges to curtail it. 251",body_text,text,0.9028944911297853,75,390,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

It initially drew on archival research to debunk the current scholarly consensus that the privilege is an ahistorical, mid-twentieth-century invention. It then explained why completely abolishing the privilege could be harmful to both public safety and law enforcement transparency and accountability. Finally, it considered and critiqued arguments that the privilege should not apply to information possessed by private entities.

"We are now back to the conundrum with which we started. Criminal defendants sometimes have legitimate interests in accessing information about law enforcement methods, and police and prosecutors sometimes have legitimate interests in withholding that information. Yet, empowering the state to keep this information secret creates the risk that the secrecy power will be abused. Meanwhile, judges deciding whether to uphold a privilege claim must resolve an issue of specialized expertise without the benefits of a full adversarial process to educate them about the law and facts. The result leaves courts in a bind and disadvantages the entire truth-seeking process in cases that implicate life, liberty, and police accountability.",body_text,text,1.0,83,440,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"The current doctrine's vagueness makes this conundrum worse. Federal appellate case law simply reiterates the privilege's policy rationale as the test for asserting threshold claims and, consequently, imposes virtually no meaningful constraint on law enforcement's secrecy power. The policy rationale supposedly motivating the privilege-that disclosure of investigative methods would risk countermeasures-could theoretically apply to almost any investigative technique. Vagueness invites law enforcement to overclaim the privilege, whether to conceal mistakes and negligence, to hide unlawful and unconstitutional conduct, or simply to avoid the hassle and inconvenience of having investigative methods challenged in court.

Courts should demand to know the conditions that law enforcement previously imposed on access to the allegedly privileged information. Were recipients required to sign a nondisclosure agreement? If so, what were the terms? Was access revoked or information returned at the close of each investigation? Where and how was the information stored? Was access supervised, logged, or required to occur at a secure, monitored location? The answers to these questions reveal law enforcement's own tolerance for leaks and should thus establish a transparency floor: At a minimum, if the court can impose protective-order safeguards that match or exceed what law enforcement previously required, then disclosure does not significantly increase the risk of the secret getting out.

"The answer to this problem is simple: Courts should use law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct regarding the confidentiality of the information as circumstantial evidence of an acceptable risk of leaks. Courts should demand to know how law enforcement previously treated the allegedly privileged information. As an initial matter, if law enforcement failed to take reasonable care before coming to court, then in most cases judges should be able to avoid the difficult task of digging further and simply default to ordering disclosure. Second, even if the government manages to cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should often still be possible for courts to accommodate defense access. Here is a simple procedure to do so. Courts should compare how law enforcement itself previously treated the information to the safeguards that a protective order could afford. If judges can craft a protective order that matches or exceeds the protections that law enforcement previously imposed, then ordering disclosure would not create a significant new risk of leaks and courts should, once again, default to ordering disclosure.",body_text,text,0.999124343257443,91,476,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Onceagain, there are a few responses. To start, law enforcement's conduct should set a floor, not a ceiling, for transparency. That is how most nongovernmental privileges and trade secret laws already work. One must show a reasonable expectation of confidentiality to claim the attorney-client, spousal, clergy-penitent, or psychotherapist-patient privilege.

"Next, to the extent that law enforcement's institutional incentives lean toward secrecy, using law enforcement's pre-dispute conduct as a proxy will offer a conservative estimate of an acceptable risk of leaks.

"Economics literature helps to explain the significance of such costs. According to economist Michael Spence, whether decisionmakers can rely on information (e.g., confidentiality conduct) as a signal for an unseen characteristic (e.g., truly sensitive investigative methods) depends on two traits. 356 To start, the signal itself should correlate positively with the unseen characteristic. Next, the cost of generating the signal should correlate negatively with the same unseen characteristic. 357 For courts assessing law enforcement privilege claims, law enforcement's pre-dispute confidentiality conduct has both traits. It correlates positively with truly sensitive investigative methods because such methods that are not kept confidential will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the cost differential for law enforcement to generate confidentiality increases as the sensitivity of the investigative method decreases: Any friction that confidentiality imposes on law enforcement operations will have fewer countervailing benefits for investigative methods that do not actually need secrecy to remain effective. Spence's theory thus suggests that confidentiality would be a reliable signal for courts, even as law enforcement may ex ante game its conduct in response to the judicial test.",body_text,text,0.9484612532443456,112,567,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Concededly, officers engaged in knowing fraud or misconduct present the most challenging case because these individuals will find ex ante secrecy so valuable. Whether evaluating their pre-dispute conduct will help judges depends on whether one thinks the individuals' incentives to lie will increase or decrease as litigation proceeds. If the incentives to lie will increase, then assessing their pre-dispute conduct will still be more reliable than their postdispute testimony. If the incentives to lie will decrease, perhaps because the risk of punishment for perjury creates a successful deterrent, then this is the edge case where this Article's reform proposal will offer no benefit.",body_text,text,0.9963689179375453,113,568,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Of course, not every judge will wring their hands at the thought that current doctrine creates an exceedingly vague or even conceptually limitless law enforcement secrecy power. On the contrary, the vagueness of current doctrine is judge-made and arguably reflects a variety of institutional incentives shared by many members of the judiciary. As Ana Lvovsky has articulated especially well, judges' motives for deferring to law enforcement are numerous and can include political pressures; personal ideological sympathies; pragmatic sensitivity to the challenges of policing; a desire to manage caseloads by simplifying or avoiding otherwise 'sticky legal issues'; a preference for disposing of issues through 'procedural lenience' towards the police rather than potentially 'controversial or corrosive substantive holdings'; and a pull to",body_text,text,0.8031573754316724,114,570,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to conclude that there is no hope for judge-made doctrine to bound the law enforcement privilege more reasonably. Judges have a mix of institutional incentives, including pressures to protect the interests of criminal defendants. 361 Secrecy concerning law enforcement investigative techniques does not entirely eliminate docket-clogging motions or thorny legal and constitutional issues. Those that remain still present time-consuming battles of the experts; they are simply less informed. Perhaps most significant, even a single judge adopting the proposed reform and ordering disclosure could produce widespread benefits for both police accountability and investigative accuracy. Even if investigative methods are disclosed under a strict protective order, the judge's conclusions as to their lawfulness and reliability need not be. Regardless of the overarching institutional incentives of the judiciary, some individual judges will wish to engage in a more probing review of law enforcement secrecy claims. This Article's proposal should help those judges.",body_text,text,0.9520488230165649,116,574,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Each of these reasons may well help to account for the current state of law enforcement privilege doctrine. Vagueness in the doctrine provides cover for deference. Deference, in turn, enables judges to avoid uncomfortable and time-consuming decisions. By maintaining the secrecy of law enforcement techniques, courts make it less likely that defendants will expose borderline or indeterminate police investigative conduct that might raise complex factual inquiries, hard constitutional and legal questions, and ultimately require the suppression of probative evidence of guilt, including in prosecutions of very serious crimes. Put succinctly, secrecy can forestall entire lines of motion practice that would otherwise clog dockets and force difficult rulings. 360",body_text,text,0.9299207800121877,115,575,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

The response to this objection is simple: Whether protective orders should yield to follow-on disclosure needs is a separate determination with its own standards for judgment. 366 Courts should not mix and match their reasoning by allowing speculation about future disclosure needs to contaminate the threshold inquiry of whether a privilege has been legitimately invoked.,body_text,text,0.9525032092426188,118,583,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Judge José A. Cabranes writing for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit aptly described the conundrum at the heart of this Article: 'It is hard to imagine, therefore, many 'question[s] of law' that carry greater 'significan[ce]' than the question of when the goals of the law enforcement privilege must give way to a party's need for discovery.' 367",body_text,text,0.7668161434977578,119,585,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"This Article has explained how the law enforcement privilege can obstruct police accountability and lead to wrongful convictions while acknowledging that, in some cases, it serves important policy goals in effective investigative methods. The Article teased out what minimal rules exist to cabin the privilege in current federal appellate doctrine and identified a core problem with those rules: In a subtle conceptual collapse, courts are mistakenly using the privilege's policy rationale as the test for assessing threshold claims to privilege. That rationale is too vague to create a meaningful constraint.",body_text,text,0.9983579638752053,120,586,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"After providing this positive account of the law enforcement privilege and its problems, the Article turned normative. To lay the groundwork for a reasoned reform proposal, it initially debunked the current scholarly consensus that no privilege for law enforcement methods existed at common law. The erroneous view that the privilege is ahistorical mystifies the challenges of reforming what is in fact longstanding and entrenched. Next, the Article considered existing proposals to abolish the privilege, either entirely or for information possessed by private entities. Neither proposal withstands serious scrutiny.",body_text,text,1.0,121,593,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"More generally, this Article's analysis suggests a new 'circumstantial evidence' theory of confidentiality's role in privilege law as a whole, with potentially radical implications for government privilege writ large. Most non -government privileges that shield communications between two parties-such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges-require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate. 368 He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that 'originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.' 369 That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist. 370",body_text,text,0.8064250411861614,123,594,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
"Instead, the Article argued that courts should evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. To do this, judges should assess how law enforcement itself previously treated the purportedly privileged information. If the safeguards available through a court-ordered protective order could match or exceed law enforcement's own prior confidentiality requirements, courts should default to ordering disclosure. This approach has substantive, institutional, procedural, and normative advantages. Though the approach deviates substantially from current appellate requirements, it has precedents in other areas of secrecy law and literature.",body_text,text,0.9985486211901307,122,595,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege

"This Article has offered an alternative 'circumstantial evidence' rationale for confidentiality requirements that applies as easily to topical as to communications privileges: A privilege claimant's pre-dispute conduct concerning the confidentiality of information offers circumstantial evidence of the value of keeping that information secret. The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant's own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information. None of this reasoning need be limited to the law enforcement privilege alone. The issue of adding confidentiality requirements to constrain other government secrecy powers is thus ripe for further scholarly contribution.",body_text,text,0.9694224235560589,125,601,michigan_law_review_law_enforcement_privilege
