"The Biden Administration's American Rescue Plan Act allotted almost $220 billion to state, local, and tribal governments to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This money, the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, gave recipients wide spending discretion to address their struggling economies. But the legislation had one key limitation: Recipients could not use the money to 'directly or indirectly' cut their taxes. If a recipient violated this 'Offset Provision,' the Department of the Treasury might recoup the funds.",body_text,text,0.9492481203007519,1,20,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing
"Nearly two-dozen states alleged that the Offset Provision was unduly coercive and ambiguous, violating the Spending Clause. However, with no threatened recoupment looming, it was unclear whether the states had standing to sue at all. The five circuit courts that heard these cases did not reach consensus on the standing issue. Numerous opinions across six cases offered differing conceptions of 'sovereign' injuries and applied Massachusetts v.

"The Offset Provision cases provide the first opportunity to study the intersection of the Spending Clause and state standing. With no precedent on when states can challenge congressional spending legislation, the cases navigated standing's incoherent doctrine to craft new rules. The Offset Provision cases offer two novel categories of sovereign injuries-in-fact that states allegedly suffer in Spending Clause cases: the 'Spending Contract' and 'Tax Power' injuries. The former relates to an unconstitutionally ambiguous or coercive federal offer, while the latter describes an impermissible regulatory subject matter.",body_text,text,0.9838709677419355,3,22,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Spending Clause. The Offset Provision cases produced two general categories of sovereign injuries, styled here as the 'Spending Contract' injury and the 'Tax Power' injury. The Spending Contract injury, the asserted basis for standing in the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, 20 focuses on the offer : Congress offends state sovereignty when it offers federal funds with coercive or ambiguous spending conditions. 21 The Tax Power injury-a 'plus factor' for standing in the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits-focuses on the subject matter : States can challenge congressional exercises of the Spending Clause that constrain certain sovereign prerogatives, like the power to tax. 22",body_text,text,0.7875457875457875,10,53,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing
"Although it is true that states suffer some form of sovereign injury when Congress exceeds its spending power, most of the Offset Provision decisions are simply too broad. An expansive Spending Contract injury incentivizes states to hunt for ambiguous provisions in legislative text and enjoin imagined enforcement merely because the ambiguity exists at the quasi-contractual offer stage. Furthermore, the Tax Power injury might significantly limit the use of the Spending Clause, granting standing if policy touches something-anything-'sovereign' enough. These injuries offer two new standing weapons to enterprising state attorneys general seeking to oppose federal spending policy: (1) searching and destroying legislative ambiguity, or (2) quarantining state tax policies from federal influence. Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on 'dubious' and 'lawless' standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations, 23 leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them. Because Congress often relies on its spending power for modern legislation, 24 an expansive 'welcome' mat into federal court risks further turning the judiciary into the arbiter of policy battles. 25",body_text,text,0.84472049689441,11,55,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

Halderman , courts evaluate the second prong according to the 'clear notice' canon of statutory interpretation. 75 The solution is not for courts to entirely strike down ambiguous provisions. 76 Instead, when interpreting relevant spending conditions, a court must fill the shoes of the funds' recipient (here, a state) at the time it chose to accept the deal and ask whether the state 'would clearly understand' its statutory obligations and liabilities. 77 The spending condition is still enforced but in a way that the states could have fairly anticipated. The Court's clear notice rule for the second prong helps facilitate federalism by ensuring the spending conditions are enforced in unsurprising ways.",body_text,text,0.7957559681697612,27,128,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"Although the relevant cases place some limits on congressional spending, the Supreme Court has been 'less interested' in policing exercises of the Spending Clause, possibly to avoid overreaching into a highly political negotiation process. 87 The Court's disinterest in enforcement likely results from the greater agency a state has when Congress creates a spending program as opposed to exercising another federal power: Instead of simple preemption by federal fiat, a state can say no to the contract. 88 Politics at both state and federal governing levels-not Article III courts-decide whether a state adopts a policy. Rather than involving itself in every political disagreement, the federal judiciary should step in only when necessary to ensure 'healthy federalism'when Congress has actually violated Dole (or Sebelius ).

"Nonetheless, given the Spending Clause's flexibility, Congress increasingly relies on appropriating funds to achieve its policymaking goals in lieu of other Article I powers subject to the Senate filibuster, political polarization, and other constitutional impediments. 84 Congressional reliance on spending should not be mistaken for abuse. Professor Jonathan Gould explains that in recent decades, Congress's ability to regulate through other Article I powers has faced greater challenges under judicial review, with the Supreme Court crafting limitations on Congress's interstate commerce power and in other constitutional doctrines such as anticommandeering and nondelegation. 85 For better or worse, the Spending Clause is one of the federal government's few remaining means to reliably effectuate welfarist policies on a national scale. Furthermore, even in the hands of a Congress uninterested in redistributive policies, the fourth prong of Dole -that spending conditions cannot require states to engage in unconstitutional behavior-prevents serious threats against individual liberties. 86",body_text,text,0.9506334643949322,29,142,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

Based on previous spending cases, Professor Stephen Vladeck argues that the Spending Clause furnishes states with standing to challenge coercive spending conditions. 162 Based on the foregoing discussion of the judicial constraints on the congressional spending power and the states' role in administering federal policy, states clearly are constitutionally entitled to some standing to challenge truly coercive or ambiguous spending conditions.",body_text,text,0.8079658605974396,48,249,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

A majority of the courts hearing the Offset Provision cases-likely drawing from their underlying, merits-based views of the Spending Clause-found standing for state plaintiffs in every instance of congressional ambiguity. Indeed, those courts also held mostly for the state plaintiffs on the merits. Further, although not always clearly articulated by the circuit courts, several of the Offset Provision opinions suggest that there are some categories of sovereign policy interests that create de facto sovereign injuries for standing purposes-in this case, the power to tax. As in Biden v. Nebraska , the Offset Provision cases have effectively provided state plaintiffs with a blueprint for challenging federal policy going forward: (1) assert state standing in legislative ambiguity or a 'sovereign' policy area, (2) argue that these policies are ambiguous and coercive, and (3) wait for the court to block the federal policy from taking national effect.",body_text,text,0.9857493857493858,49,250,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing

"The circuit majority's approach-not requiring imminence-comports with at least one scholarly conception of special solicitude. 206 Professor Bulman-Pozen argues that state suits against federal agencies (and expansive state standing to facilitate those suits) are desirable to ensure that federal officials 'come to the table' and bargain with the states on the terms of that federal policy. 207 Bulman-Pozen's argument is not based on the sovereignty of the state plaintiff-she concedes Massachusetts v. EPA 's confirmation that states have lost their sovereign prerogatives to the federal government. 208 Rather, it is based on her general view of federalism as a means to ventilate partisan disputes and create 'deliberation-generating froth in our democratic system.' 209 States, without their traditional autonomy, need a legal environment that can help facilitate this bargaining. 210 The expansive version of the Spending Contract injury would do just that.

"Determining state standing for sovereign injuries should not be an openended affair. Curtailing special solicitude's future use will help simplify lower federal courts' standing analyses for continuing state challenges to federal policy. 296 State plaintiffs should not get a free pass to contest federal policy merely by virtue of their sovereign status. And if they somehow do, it should at least be on a more concrete doctrinal basis, rather than 'extra-credit' and judicial spitballing. 297",body_text,text,0.9138576779026217,122,455,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing
"The Offset Provision cases were the perfect storm for a messy circuit split. ARPA was a highly political bill, the Offset Provision was complicated, and $200 billion were on the line. One legal doctrine at issue-standing-is inundated with inconsistency. The other-spending-is bereft of case law: a nascent jurisprudence likely to develop as Congress continues to rely on it. The Offset Provision cases were an intricate first attempt at conceptualizing together the two previously unwed doctrines. The fruits of the courts' analyses, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearly every case-regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments. The sovereign Spending Clause injuries are powerful tools: pleading strategies for ambitious states to destroy the federal policies they oppose. Spending Clause standing must have a higher standard, and special solicitude must not become a renewed red carpet for state plaintiffs.",body_text,text,0.9801623083859333,123,457,michigan_law_review_spending_clause_standing
