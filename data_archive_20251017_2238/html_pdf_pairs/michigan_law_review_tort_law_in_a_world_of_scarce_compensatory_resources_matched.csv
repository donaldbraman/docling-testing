"Large corporations facing extensive tort liabilities have often gone into bankruptcy, forcing tort plaintiffs to accept pennies on the dollar as compensation for their injuries. Bankruptcy painfully illustrates the social fact that the compensatory properties of tort law depend on the availability of compensatory resources. Although this feature of tort law is self-evident, no one has adequately analyzed whether it matters for substantive tort doctrine, and if so, how.",body_text,text,1.0,1,20,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"Wealth would seem to be substantively irrelevant given the rule that excludes evidence concerning the defendant's financial resources when determining breach or compensatory damages. The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor's prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law-why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",body_text,text,0.9974271012006861,2,21,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"After identifying the relevant noncontroversial tort principles, Part I explains why courts can defensibly consider matters like insolvency and liability insurance when formulating substantive tort doctrine. To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a 'social currency' that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injurycausing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",body_text,text,0.9867474441499432,12,45,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented ex ante instead of being compensated ex post with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy. The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury.

"As previously discussed, compensatory resources are also scarce because defendants often do not have enough money to satisfy their tort judgments. Under the early common law, a judgment that rendered the defendant insolvent was not simply a financial matter. The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment. 13 Debtor's prison-a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century 14 -supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability. Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant's culpability. The subsequent emergence of modern bankruptcy law eliminated the burden of criminal punishment from this normative calculus. In principle, the transformation of debtor's prison into modern bankruptcy could expand the scope of substantive tort liability, a dynamic that has never adequately factored into the leading accounts of tort law.",body_text,text,0.7648183556405354,15,52,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Legal protection is not enough. The plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages only if the injury is to a legally protected interest with a relative priority over the defendant's conflicting, legally protected interest. The balancing of interests can also work in the other direction, with the defendant's interest receiving a relative priority over the plaintiff's conflicting interest, in which case the plaintiff's injury to the legally protected, subordinate interest 'does not suffice to collect damages.' 22",body_text,text,0.8362543815723585,27,75,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

Consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff's impaired interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm. In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. 'Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.' Id. These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff's protected, injured interest over the defendant's conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner. The burden of proof then maintains the integrity of this priority. The plaintiff must prove the elements of the prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence. When the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.

For example, courts could balance conflicting interpersonal interests in security and liberty by reference to an underlying principle of substantive equality that gives everyone an equal right to selfdetermination or autonomy. This type of balancing would require courts to determine the relative importance of the conflicting security and liberty interests for individuals to lead a life of their own choosing. Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare.

"A principled categorical evaluation of duty is still governed by the normative calculus of tort law. The principle of formal equality obligates courts to equally account for the conflicting interests of both right-holders and dutybearers. In a negligence case, the normative calculus of reasonable care asks whether the defendant failed to take a safety precaution and incur the associated burden on liberty that was reasonable in light of the reduced threat or risk to the plaintiff's interest in physical security. 39 The underlying normative problem-the fair way to balance conflicting interpersonal interests in liberty and security-does not disappear when courts address the antecedent question of whether the defendant owed a duty of care. As applied to the element of duty, the normative calculus is simply reoriented from the individual case to the general category of cases the duty governs, thereby enabling courts to consider normatively relevant facts beyond those in the case at hand.",body_text,text,0.9865871833084948,39,110,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

"Over time, the criminal law became the exclusive province of the state, leaving the victims of crime with a tort claim for monetary compensation. The rise of punitive damages within tort law then became the injury victim's surrogate to obtain retribution for reprehensible misconduct that the compensatory damages remedy could not adequately redress. But unlike its counterpart in the state of nature, the punitive remedy is embodied in an award of monetary damages. This tort remedy enables an injured victim to exact financial revenge without engaging in any violence-a civilized attribute of the tort remedy which gained further value as the market economy developed. The only wayto punish a corporate wrongdoer-the cause of widespread injury in modern society-is by inflicting financial pain through a tort award of punitive damages. These developments have led to the now conventional understanding that the early common law 'approach[ed] the field of tort through the field of crime.' 87",body_text,text,0.8304347826086956,78,207,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

'By comparison with the conveniences and comforts widely available in developed economies at the end of the 20th century, everyday life two centuries ago was most akin to what we know today as 'camping out.'

A wide range of risky behaviors contribute to the background level of reasonable risk in a community. For example, reasonably safe driving can still cause a crash. This familiar form of risky behavior is part of the background level of reasonable risk a community tolerates. The duty governing these kinds of common, risky social interactions burdens the ordinary person while creating risks (such as by driving); it also protects them from the risky behavior of others (like passing drivers on the roadway). For the category of risky interactions comprising the background level of reasonable risk in the community, the ordinary right-holder is also a reciprocally situated duty-bearer who incurs the full burden of the duty.

"In yet one more respect, then, the problem of scarce compensatory resources alters the normative calculus of tort law in a predictable way that conventional tort theories have not recognized. Like duty-bearers, right-holders do not have unlimited compensatory resources and accordingly have a reasonable interest in minimizing their injury compensation costs. For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder's total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrencebased liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",body_text,text,0.9985948477751756,169,434,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources

For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 387, 394-96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder's willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk.

"Within the Bankruptcy Code, 'a significant part of its distributional scheme is oriented toward establishing priorities among creditors.' 264 Secured creditors are prioritized over unsecured creditors, and all tort claimants are lumped together as unsecured creditors. 265 Outside bankruptcy-that is, within the common law of torts-the only way for courts to prioritize among tort claimants is by substantively limiting the tort duty to effectively implement the equitable principle, the 'worst should go first.' This substantive solution to managing the problem of insolvency is crude compared to an idealized procedural alternative, but it is the only one that has been and continues to be available to courts in tort cases.",body_text,text,0.9211032713277743,227,588,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"The characteristic tort remedy for both compensatory and punitive purposes is a monetary damages award, which on one view is a defining attribute of tort law: '[N]o civil injury is to be classed as a tort unless the appropriate remedy for it is an action for damages. Such an action is an essential characteristic of every true tort.' 266 The tort remedy depends on the scarce resource of money, yet no one has comprehensively analyzed how the associated scarcity of compensatory resources affects substantive tort law.",body_text,text,0.8927335640138409,228,590,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
"Aside from this Article, to my knowledge, the only other extended analysis of this question asks how courts should formulate tort rules in an 'age of austerity.' 267 An interesting question for sure. If a future wracked by climate change is one of increased scarcity, courts will 'have to make choices as to which violations of someone's basic rights should be remedied by the state.' 268 Rather than doing so by a 'ranking order of basic wrongs,' 269 courts, for reasons of principle, should rely on the same normative calculus which has shaped tort law from its origins in the customary practices in the state of nature up to its current incarnation. For principled reasons, a substantial reduction in compensatory resources will substantially contract substantive duties, significantly limiting liability in a manner akin to what tort law looked like in the earlier stages of industrialization. The contraction will not be that severefortunately, there is no debtor's prison this time around. But substantive tort",body_text,text,0.8549289711579854,229,591,michigan_law_review_tort_law_in_a_world_of_scarce_compensatory_resources
