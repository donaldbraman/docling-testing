"abstract. For generations, scholars have called on Congress to counter the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, which offers legal advice that bolsters presidential power. They argue that a 'congressional Office of Legislative Counsel (OLC)' could safeguard Congress's prerogatives in the face of executive and judicial aggrandizement. Recently, these calls have prompted Congress to consider creating such a body. But participants in this conversation have assumed that nothing like a congressional OLC has ever existed on Capitol Hill.",body_text,text,0.9471766848816029,0,3,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism
"This Article corrects the record. It provides the first analysis of five hundred opinions and memoranda showing that Congress had something like a congressional OLC for a half-century. From 1919 to 1969, the two Offices of the Legislative Counsel-one in the Senate and one in the House of Representatives-developed a system for resolving lawmakers' constitutional questions using a hierarchy of precedential opinions, nonprecedential memoranda, and briefs. When these Offices constructed constitutional meaning, they put a thumb on the scale for congressional power with a novel reasonable-doubt standard designed to vindicate Article I power. Lawyers in Congress used these opinions to construct constitutional meaning, establish drafting conventions, flesh out Congress's role in the administrative state, and build up Congress's hard and soft powers.",body_text,text,0.9941383352872216,1,5,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism
"The Columbia Triumvirate's actions provide an important example of institution building amid today's 'congressional declinism.' Like many Americans now, the Columbia Triumvirate looked at Capitol Hill with anguish. Their agenda depended on the construction of a new and implicit governing paradigm. While the opinions are important historical artifacts, their very existence is the more consequential discovery. Ultimately, this Article provides a thick history of the opinions-drafting practice to help us better understand institutional development within Congress. This Article simultaneously aims to help us rediscover the spirit of institutional innovation that gripped the Columbia Triumvirate. If today we are unsatisfied with Congress, we should imagine and build the institutions that will help our national legislature maintain its place of primacy.",body_text,text,0.9930151338766007,3,6,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

"On May 27, 1929, Senator David Reed (R-PA) strode onto the Senate floor near the pinnacle of his institutional prestige. 1 Reed, a decorated veteran of the Meuse-Argonne offensive, personified the postwar period's jingoistic patriotism. 2 Five years earlier, Reed helped codify the national zeitgeist with the 1924 Immigration Act (the Johnson-Reed Act). 3 The Act sharply limited the flow of new immigrants. 4 It fit within Reed's project, which emphasized the reification of Anglo-American political and cultural power.",body_text,text,0.9922928709055877,6,25,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

Having restricted immigration to a trickle, nativists looked forward to the 1930 census as an opportunity. 5 The Senate was debating a provision that would exclude noncitizens from the census count and curb their political influence. 6 Because the law implicated the same nativist feelings that were behind the 1924 Immigration Act, all eyes fell on Reed.",body_text,text,0.9978540772532188,7,26,yale_law_journal_Resurrecting_the_Trinity_of_Legislative_Constitutionalism

Scholars have dismissed the Office's pre-1970s influence, characterizing it as weak and inconsequential. 18 The existing literature has no answer to the influence on display in the Reed incident.

This second article will deal with related doctrinal questions, such as whether the congressional OLCs made textualism and purposivism possible by making Congress's statutes professional and legible.

The midcentury occupants of the congressional OLCs pushed beyond the Columbia Triumvirate's nonpartisanship to embrace neutrality on questions of congressional power. In this, the congressional OLCs set a precedent for other components of the congressional bureaucracy-for example, CRS-that have been stymied by a kind of hyperneutrality that demands that congressional bureaucrats avoid answering consequential questions entirely.
