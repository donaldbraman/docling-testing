"abstract. For incarcerated people litigating pro se, the civil discovery process is vitally important. When imprisoned litigants lack meaningful access to discovery, their cases become swearing contests they are bound to lose, and wrongdoing in prison goes unaddressed. Yet for these same plaintiffs, civil discovery is defunct. The vast majority of incarcerated plaintiffs, including those with promising or meritorious claims, are unable to navigate either to or through litigation's discovery phase. Part diagnosis and part treatment, this Article is the first to explore in depth how the discovery process fails those pursuing civil-rights claims against their jailers, revealing both a crisis in prison litigation and a failure of our procedural regime.",body_text,text,0.9986807387862797,0,3,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis
"The Article then scrutinizes the dockets and filings of two hundred recent federal cases arising out of two prisons in two quite different districts: Angola in the Middle District of Louisiana and Menard Correctional Center in the Southern District of Illinois. This research reveals differences between the districts' case-management decisions and cultures, resulting in startling disparities in prison litigants' discovery prospects. Incarcerated litigants' current chances of evidencing and vindicating claims may be largely contingent on the district in which their prison sits-what some incarcerated people call 'justice by jurisdiction. ' Arguing that this situation is both untenable and preventable, the Article suggests multiple concrete avenues for reform.",body_text,text,0.991508817766166,2,4,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis
"Relying on both case research and extensive interviews with federal judges, staff attorneys, prison-rights lawyers, formerly incarcerated people, and prison officials, the Article chronicles prison discovery's written and unwritten rules and their failures. It begins with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which map awkwardly or not at all onto prison litigation. It then discusses the much broader amalgam of practical impediments to evidence gathering in prison. These include information asymmetries, resource disparities, and hostility between prison defendants-who create and control most of the evidence relevant to incarcerated people's claims-and plaintiffs.",body_text,text,0.9821162444113264,1,5,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis

"Part I explores the written rules governing prison litigation, including the scant few bearing on discovery. It begins by surveying the impoverished legal options available to those who wish to resist the harsh conditions of their confinement in federal court. The barriers are twofold: many of prison's indignities simply lie outside the scope of federal causes of action, and for those few who can locate a cognizable claim, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)-a 1996 law aimed at stemming frivolous prison litigation-makes its vindication nearly impossible, imposing procedural hurdles at litigation's earliest phases. 58 Most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims thus fail before discovery even begins. For the few cases that emerge, effective discovery is of vital importance: having survived the PLRA's hurdles, these are the cases that everyone agrees could well be nonfrivolous-ample reason they be properly evidenced and heard. For these cases, discovery promises fairness, exposure, and regulation sorely needed in the carceral context.

"Part II turns to the unwritten rules that cement discovery's failures for those plaintiffs who do access the process, relying on case research and dozens of interviews with formerly incarcerated people, federal magistrate and district judges, staff attorneys, civil-rights lawyers, and prison officials. 59 This Part begins by outlining the predictable evidentiary needs undergirding most incarcerated plaintiffs' claims. These needs are not inherently harder to fulfill in the prison context; the problem instead lies in the practical constraints hindering the process. Security concerns make a significant share of relevant evidence simply undiscoverable. And since prisons control the creation and storage of most evidence-surveillance footage, written incident reports, and the likenegligence or ill will can mean the disappearance of (or the failure ever to produce) vital information. Resource restrictions make valuable discovery tools like depositions and expert reports inaccessible to imprisoned litigants, shutting off any real hope of poking holes in a defendant's story or proving a doctor's indifference to a medical condition. And hostility between incarcerated people and their jailers breeds distrust, foot-dragging, and credible allegations of spoliation. Together, these difficulties are different in both degree and kind from those faced by other pro se litigants and civil-rights plaintiffs. The Article thus draws the unavoidable conclusion that the aspirationally transsubstantive Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wholly disserve prison litigation. Without unique intervention, no meaningful opportunity exists for incarcerated plaintiffs to evidence their claims. Through this lens, the Article contributes to ongoing efforts to distinguish law in theory from law in practice 60 and joins a mounting chorus of",body_text,text,0.9733475479744137,33,151,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis

"Part III focuses on two prisons in different federal districts: Angola in the Middle District of Louisiana and Menard Correctional Center in the Southern District of Illinois. In a quasi-empirical, quasi-descriptive study, I scrutinize the dockets and filings in two hundred cases-the first fifty cases from each prison filed in 2016 and 2022-to see whether discovery occurred, and, if so, whether different courts' approaches to the process made any meaningful difference in the litigation's prospects or outcomes.",body_text,text,0.9922330097087378,34,155,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis
"The results are startling. In 2016, plaintiffs' cases went to discovery in about three-quarters of cases in the Southern District of Illinois but under one-fifth of cases in the Middle District of Louisiana. Plaintiffs settled or won almost half of the cases they brought in the Southern District of Illinois but none in the Middle District of Louisiana. The districts' differences extend to case-management decisions, with discrepancies in decisions to open or close; when and whether to impose initial-disclosure obligations; how to interact with incarcerated litigants confused by the process; and when and whether to recruit counsel in complex cases. The same trends extended to 2022, with discovery, settlement, and counsel recruitment skewed significantly toward Menard plaintiffs. In illuminating the districts' differences, Part III draws descriptive accounts from cases forming the basis of the study.",body_text,text,0.9967032967032967,35,156,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis

"Part IV ends by suggesting avenues for reform. First, courts should, where resources permit, be far more open to recruiting counsel for imprisoned plaintiffs embarking upon discovery. Second, courts should standardize the discovery process in prison litigation, creating certain tailored discovery rules for imprisoned litigants' claims. Third, judges should intervene through telephonic status conferences to advise plaintiffs on the process and ensure that they are not floundering or getting the runaround. Fourth, courts should take creative approaches to widening the availability of discovery tools, including making use of new technology to broaden incarcerated litigants' access to oral depositions. And finally, there should be efforts both in and out of court to police the creation, storage, and disclosure of evidence. This includes spoliation sanctions or curative measures when prisons overwrite surveillance footage after someone has filed a grievance implicating that footage. It also means devising standardized protocols for flagging evidence that poses security risks, along with safe procedures to handle that evidence's production and use. These admittedly incomplete proposals mark the start of a long-needed confrontation with our prison discovery crisis.",body_text,text,0.9976525821596244,37,160,yale_law_journal_The_Prison_Discovery_Crisis
