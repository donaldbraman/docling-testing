"how can a better balance be struck? this article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: the policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. the article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. the answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. the article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.","how can a better balance be struck? this article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: the policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. the article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. the answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. the article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.",text,unknown,body-text,1.000,✗
