[1] mr. washington maintained that he feared for his safety given the tenuous relationship between police and black men, which in baltimore had proven explosive after the 2015 police killing of freddie gray. [2] thus, he insisted that his reasonable, fear-based flight from police should not contribute to the “reasonable suspicion” required for those officers to stop and search him. [3] in december, the maryland supreme court [4] conceded that mr. washington’s flight from police was a reasonable reaction amid public instances of police violence against young black men, especially in baltimore, and empirical evidence of racialized policing. [5] while engaging with mr. washington’s arguments and those of courts that discount “flight from police” and “high-crime area” as factors in the reasonable suspicion calculus because of their racialized application, the court concluded that mr. washington’s unprovoked flight in a high-crime area gave officers the reasonable suspicion required.

[14] ultimately, the court explained that it was applying wardlow as it always had, in holding that flight from police in a high-crime area is relevant to the totality of circumstances but does not per se establish reasonable suspicion.

[16] in the absence of additional guidance since wardlow , lower courts wrestle with how much conduct that is consistent with lawful behavior, but subjectively suspicious to a police officer, is sufficient to support reasonable suspicion. [17] the fifth circuit recently found police had reasonable suspicion to detain an individual where the officer observed him sitting in the front seat of his car for ten to fifteen seconds, parked in the lot of an open convenience store in a high-crime area. [18] on the other hand, several federal circuits and state courts refuse to permit a person’s lawful conduct in a high-crime area, on its own, to constitute reasonable suspicion. [19] because reasonable suspicion is a contextual, totality of circumstances determination, it is difficult for reviewing courts to determine which factor was dispositive when several factors, each themselves consistent with innocent behavior, is “relevant.” as the seventh circuit acknowledged, “[w]hether you stand still or move, drive above, below, or at the speed limit, you will be described by the police as acting suspiciously should they wish to stop and arrest you.” [20]",

[29] mr. washington relied upon three categories in support of his argument: (1) empirical data confirming that black men are disproportionately stopped, searched, arrested by police, and more likely to be subject to the use of force; [30] (2) the proliferation of publicly disseminated footage depicting police violence against black men, making flight a reasonable reaction; [31] and (3) particular events such as the prominent death of freddie gray in police custody, the department of justice’s documented investigation into baltimore city police, and the recent scandal within the gun trace task force, which affirmed a fear of police among baltimore city residents. [32] within this context, mr. washington reasoned that wardlow’ s conclusion-that unprovoked flight from police suggests criminal wrongdoing-is profoundly outdated. instead, flight from police reflects a reasonable fear for one’s safety and merits minimal or no weight in establishing reasonable suspicion.",

[33] focusing on a report documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black men in boston, the court recognized “a reason for flight totally unrelated to the consciousness of guilt,” explaining that mr. warren’s flight “might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled.” thus, flight from police should be given “little, if any, weight as a factor probative in reasonable suspicion.” [34]",

[40] new hampshire’s highest court also held that “race is an appropriate circumstance to consider in conducting the totality of the circumstances seizure analysis.” [41] federal circuit courts are in conflict: the ninth and d.c. circuit have held that a defendant’s race can inform the seizure analysis, [42] but the tenth and eleventh circuits exclude consideration of race in the seizure analysis, arguing that doing so would transform an objective inquiry into a subjective one.

[46] upon analyzing 990 shooting incidents from the washington post’s national police shooting database, “fatal force,” another study concluded that-even after controlling for variables like age, mental illness, crime severity, and jurisdiction size-black individuals were more than twice as likely as white individuals to have been unarmed when killed by police. [47] relative to their white peers, black citizens are more often stopped by police, subject to the use of force, and viewed by officers as posing a safety threat. [48] a third study of police-civilian encounters indicates that officers aimed or shot a gun at black individuals at eight times the rate of white individuals, and threatened force or engaged in physical contact against black individuals at four times the rate of white individuals. [49] more than two decades ago, a massachusetts court explained that “historically . . . [b]lacks who have walked, run, or raced away from inquisitive police officers have ended up beaten and battered and sometimes dead.” [50] it is thus not surprising that “black people often tread more carefully around law enforcement,” [51] reasonably believing based on “pervasive” and “persuasive” evidence, that “contact with the police can itself be dangerous.” [52]",
