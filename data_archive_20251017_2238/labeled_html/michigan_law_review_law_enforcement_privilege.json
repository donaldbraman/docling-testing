      "text": "how can a better balance be struck? this article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: the policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. the article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. the answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. the article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.",

(“it is, however, one thing to allow the privileged person to suppress the evidence, and, toto coelo , another thing to allow him to fill a gap in his own evidence by recourse to what he suppresses.”). readers of coplon may be thrown by judge hand’s reference to his prior opinion in united states v. andolschek , in which he stated that: [s]o far as [privileged documents] directly touch the criminal dealings, the prosecution necessarily ends any confidential character the documents may possess . . . . the government must choose; either it must leave the transactions in the obscurity from which a trial will draw them, or it must expose them fully. 142 f.2d 503, 506 (2d cir. 1944). the documents at issue in andolschek would arguably qualify as brady material today because the criminal prosecution in that case was “founded upon those very dealings to which the [privileged] documents relate, and whose criminality they will, or may, tend to exculpate.” id. at 506. the fact that privileges must yield to countervailing constitutional rights such as brady or the confrontation clause does not negate their existence or force in other circumstances. to be sure, judge hand conceded that “[t]his privilege will often impose a grievous hardship, for it may deprive parties . . . to criminal prosecutions of power to assert their rights or to defend themselves.” 229 coplon , 185 f.2d at 638. yet, such hardship cannot disqualify a privilege from existing because, as judge hand concluded, it is “a consequence of any evidentiary privilege.” 230 id.",
