      "text": "In her Article, Something Rots in Law Enforcement and It’s the Search Warrant: The Breonna Taylor Case , [1] Professor Blanche Bong Cook, a legal scholar and former prosecutor, digs deeply into the events leading to Breonna Taylor’s death at the hands of the Louisville Metro Police Department (“LMPD”). Cook shows that the central factual premise for searching Taylor’s apartment for her ex-boyfriend’s drugs—namely, that the ex-boyfriend received packages there—was almost certainly a lie; [2] that even with that lie, the judge should not have found probable cause to believe that drugs would be found in Taylor’s apartment; [3] that the judge also had no legitimate grounds to authorize the police to force their way into Taylor’s residence without first knocking and announcing themselves; [4] and that the subsequent police account of the circumstances of their invasion of Taylor’s residence was almost certainly another lie, facilitated both by their failure to wear cameras or to turn them on at the time of the search, and by the later opportunity—conventionally afforded the police—to get their lies straight before answering questions.

      "text": "This is the unusual case of police misconduct where some measure of accountability followed. In September 2020, the City of Louisville agreed to compensate Taylor’s family and to make policing reforms, albeit without acknowleding wrongdoing. [6] And in August 2022, a federal grand jury indicted four of the police officers who had a role in the killing. [7] But if the results had not been so tragic, resulting in so much public outrage, the police misconduct would probably have been ignored. If Taylor had survived, she would not have filed a suppression motion in a criminal case because there would have been no case against her: the police search found no evidence that she did anything wrong. [8] She would not have brought a civil rights action after the police invaded her apartment because qualified immunity would almost certainly have protected the police from liability. [9] It seems unlikely that the state Attorney General would have taken action, [10] or that the police department would itself have disciplined the officers involved or revisited its practices.",

      "text": "Cook levels some blame for Taylor’s death on the U.S. Supreme Court, [11] which gives with one hand while taking with the other: while its Fourth Amendment opinions recognize the sanctity of the home, the Court has also eliminated incentives for the police to comply with the constitutional restrictions when homes are searched. Cook takes special aim at Hudson v. Michigan , [12] which held the exclusionary rule inapplicable when police violate the ordinary requirement to knock and announce themselves before forcing their way into a home. [13] One might add that the Court has eviscerated the Fourth Amendment remedies in many more ways than one. Even when, as in Taylor’s case, an inattentive or indifferent judge issues a warrant unsupported by probable cause, the police can ordinarily assume that if they happen to discover evidence, it will be admissible under the so-called “good-faith exception” to the exclusionary rule. [14] Other Supreme Court decisions limit who has standing to challenge illegal searches, [15] so that if evidence were discovered illegally in Breonna Taylor’s apartment, her ex-boyfriend, who was not present, could not challenge the unlawful entry or search. Of course, police would have little reason to fear a lawsuit, given the Court’s exaltation of police officers’ qualified immunity from civil liability. [16]",

[19] This history makes it reasonable for people of color to fear any encounter with the police, and certainly one involving a stop, arrest, or search. That is why Black children are customarily given “The Talk” about what to do when stopped by the police. [20]",

Suppose that the LMPD officers, this time having a valid warrant in hand, announced themselves moments before breaking down Taylor’s door. The police would probably have set off precisely the same explosion of violence: someone inside Taylor’s apartment fires a gun kept for self-defense, as may predictably occur after the Court held in District of Columbia v. Heller [21] that individuals have a Second Amendment right to bear arms. [22] Then responding to the danger that the police created, the police fire back.",

Accounting for this history, a robust Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would protect the right of all members of the political community, including people of color, to be “secure in their persons” by restraining the police so that police conducting searches and seizures would not unreasonably put people in fear for their personal safety. Doing this work reasonably means reducing risks and threats of physical harm, not escalating them. For example, even if the LMPD officers had grounds to search Taylor’s apartment for drugs, it would have been unreasonable to do so at night, when the police could have known she was home and likely in bed, rather than earlier in the day when she was at work.",

[23] The Court’s constitutional jurisprudence rarely offers a way to hold police accountable for practices that make broad swaths of the population, and particularly people of color, feel personally insecure—for example, baseless and pretextual stops of pedestrians and drivers, or the use of military weaponry and other excessive force in making arrests and conducting searches. Recurring reports of racially motivated policing that people find traumatic are surely just the tip of the iceberg.

Not all constitutional rights are individual and not all are justiciable. The Constitution may establish nonjusticiable collective rights (as the Second Amendment was thought to do preHeller ) no less than judicially enforceable individual rights. The Fourth Amendment does establish individual rights, but it may also establish a more demanding right of the people collectively, which the public should insist be respected.",

On the contrary, a Fourth Amendment jurisprudence saying that the police may not create an unreasonable risk or threat of physical harm to others would be true to the words of the Fourth Amendment. Freedom from the apprehension of harm to one’s person is precisely what the Fourth Amendment promises us as a people. And to the extent that one looks to common law understandings for guidance, they reinforce this expectation. The common law tort of assault was meant, in general, to protect people against threats to personal safety, even if nineteenth-century common law courts could not have contemplated precisely how the police would one day make people fear for their lives.",

      "text": "A public conversation about minority communities’ rights to be protected, not put in fear, by the police, might help loosen the Court’s grip on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. It is important to move the conversation outside the Court because some or most of its current members envision the Fourth Amendment as less of an antimajoritarian right of vulnerable people to personal security and more of a landowner’s property right that protects against physical trespasses, much as the Takings Clause protects against outright confiscations. For example, with seemingly low regard for individuals’ interests in personal security, Justice Gorsuch joined a 5-4 decision holding that the parents of a fifteen-year-old Mexican child gunned down by a Border Patrol agent could not seek compensation, [26] and wrote a dissent asserting that the Fourth Amendment allowed officers to fire thirteen shots at a driver (who thought she was escaping carjackers), hitting her twice in the back, because she was still able to keep driving (trying to get herself to a hospital) and therefore she was never “seized.” [27] But on the other hand, in a case the Court decided not to review, Justice Gorsuch lamented that game wardens approaching a rural residence to ask the owners about illegal deer hunting may have stayed too long or strayed too far from the path to the front door to satisfy an earlier precedent.

      "text": "The Justices’ predispositions are unlikely to change any time soon, but legislative change is possible. The silver lining in Cook’s account is that in the aftermath of Taylor’s death, Louisville passed Breonna’s Law, and other jurisdictions proposed similar laws, to regulate how the police execute searches, including by banning no-knock warrants. [29] That is a measure of how recognizably awful the police conduct was in Breonna Taylor’s case. Cook advocates further reforms, not all requiring legislation, to redress the inadequacies of Fourth Amendment case law. [30] That may be an uphill battle, because Bill of Rights provisions such as the Fourth Amendment protect minority rights precisely because minorities lack equal power at the voting booth. [31] But it is a battle worth fighting, and perhaps it will be aided by a robust public understanding of the Fourth Amendment that differs from the current Court’s understanding—one that takes a more generous view of peoples’ right “to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",
