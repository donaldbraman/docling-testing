[7] On the individual level, nineteen-year old University of Texas football student-athlete Quinn Ewers’ NIL earnings total nearly $4 million, for example.

Bueckers will miss the 2022-23 women’s basketball season due to a knee injury but will return to play for UConn in 2023-24 in lieu of beginning her professional basketball career, as remaining a UConn student-athlete will provide more lucrative NIL opportunities than available in the Women’s National Basketball Association (“WNBA”).
