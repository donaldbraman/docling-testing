      "text": "Notice and comment is a public participation process, first articulated in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that was heralded at the time as a critical innovation to engage the general population in the administrative agency rulemaking process. It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases—primarily at the circuit court level—which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",

The existing statutory tool—the good cause exception to notice and comment in section 553 of the APA—should be paired with a series of public engagement tools that are already available to agencies. Unlike notice and comment, these engagement methods are minimally resource-intensive and adapted to existing twenty-first century technologies. This approach preserves meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process while addressing many of the problems apparent in notice and comment without introducing new legislation, explicitly overruling any Supreme Court jurisprudence, or imposing new resource challenges on agencies.",

      "text": "There is no shortage of scholarship addressing the challenges created by the process known as notice-and-comment rulemaking. Notice and comment is rooted in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which describes regulations promulgated through informal rulemaking 2 Informal rulemaking refers to a technical distinction between two types of rulemaking described in the APA. Most rulemaking is “informal,” due partly to the narrowing of formal rulemaking by the Supreme Court in United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Company, 410 U.S. 224 (1973). See Maeve P. Carey, Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL32240, The Federal Rulemaking Process: An Overview 5 (2013) (“Informal rulemaking, also known as ‘notice and comment’ rulemaking, is used much more frequently . . . .”). by an administrative agency as “pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment.” 3 Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i). This is the first appearance of the phrase “notice and receipt of public comment” in the APA. That phrase appears five times in the statute before a transition to the phrase “notice and opportunity for public comment” in § 552a(v)(1). It is not until § 563(a)(7), added in a later amendment to the APA, that the exact phrase “notice and comment” first appears, and it does so only twice, both in the context of a “negotiated rulemaking committee,” which allows “[a]n agency [to] establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to negotiate and develop a proposed rule, if the head of the agency determines that the use of the negotiated rulemaking procedure is in the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 563–564. The original text of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551–559, never uses the exact phrase “notice and comment,” as used by judges and legal scholars. The phrase only emerges in later amendments such as § 563. What has been seemingly lost on many is that the APA itself creates virtually no requirements for agencies other than a handful of vague references to “notice and receipt of public comment” throughout the statute. 4 See Ronald A. Cass, Rulemaking Then and Now: From Management to Lawmaking , 28 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 683, 700 (2021) (“[T]he APA’s notice-and-comment process in its original formulation (unchanged in the text of the law today) required only a spare form of notification as to the subject of a contemplated rule, virtually any form of opportunity for public input, and a bare-bones explanation of why the ultimately adopted rule was chosen. Nothing in the APA as written required specific steps to assure that comments were received from an extensive group of interested parties, that they were carefully considered by the agency, or that the agency addressed major comments in laying out the reasons behind the final rule.” (emphasis omitted)). Rather, judges created the requirements that agencies follow today through a series of cases in the 1970s and ’80s. 5 See, e.g. , United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., 568 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1977); Portland Cement Ass’n v. Ruckelshaus, 486 F.2d 375 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Fla. E. Coast Ry. , 410 U.S. 224; Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519 (1978); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). These cases laid out specific requirements for what agencies must do vis-à-vis notice and comment to survive the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review. 6 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (“The reviewing court shall . . . (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be— (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”). Those requirements have ballooned well beyond the text of the APA, creating a procedure that is often incredibly cumbersome for agencies. Rather than enabling agencies to meaningfully engage with the public as intended, modern-day notice and comment allows business interests and other well-resourced actors to play an outsized role in the rulemaking process while draining the agency’s resources. Technological developments since the 1970s, when a series of administrative law cases expanded notice and comment, have only escalated these issues through phenomena such as mass comments. 7 See, e.g. , Emily Bremer, Randolph J. May on Mass Comments and the FCC’s Net Neutrality Proceedings (ACUS Update) , Yale J. on Regul. (July 13, 2021), https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/randolph-j-may-on-mass-comments-and-the-fccs-net-neutrality-proceedings-acus-update [ perma.cc/DP63-FT4Q ] (“[T]here has been a major escalation—you could call it exercising the ‘nuclear option’—in the effort, by both opposing sides, to generate as many mass, computer-generated form comments as possible. By ‘form comments’ I mean comments that concededly contain little or no information beyond cursorily stating a ‘pro’ or ‘con’ position.”). The rapid development of artificial intelligence will surely exacerbate these challenges.",

      "text": "Many scholars have offered suggestions for how to address these problems. Some focus on legislative reform, proposing APA amendments and/or new legislation. 8 See, e.g. , Christopher J. Walker, Essay, Modernizing the Administrative Procedure Act , 69 Admin. L. Rev. 629 (2017). Others suggest introducing alternative forms of public participation, such as federal advisory committees, to supplement notice and comment. 9 See, e.g. , Cary Coglianese, Heather Kilmartin & Evan Mendelson, Transparency and Public Participation in the Federal Rulemaking Process: Recommendations for the New Administration , 77 Geo. Wash. L. Rev . 924, 953–56 (2009). However, few have entertained the concept that agencies could do only what is strictly required of them by statute to fulfill their notice-and-comment responsibilities. In fact, there is a situation in which agencies may bypass notice-and-comment requirements: “good cause rulemaking.” 10 Good cause rulemaking refers to an exception in the APA that allows an agency “to forgo Section 553’s notice and comment requirement if ‘the agency for good cause finds’ that compliance would be ‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.’ ” Jared P. Cole, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R44356, The Good Cause Exception to Notice and Comment Rulemaking: Judicial Review of Agency Action 1 (2016) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B)). There is minimal Supreme Court jurisprudence on the use of the good cause exception to notice and comment, discussed infra Section III.C. Agencies likely have been reluctant to employ the good cause exception for fear of litigation and negative court reactions. This exception is, however, the most effective and realistic option currently available to agencies to circumvent the mess that notice and comment has become. The 2024 Trump White House has instructed agencies to rely on the good cause exception to advance regulatory reform efforts, 11 Directing the Repeal of Unlawful Regulations , The White House (Apr. 9, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/directing-the-repeal-of-unlawful-regulations [ perma.cc/AV3W-BGGV ] (“The repeal of each unlawful regulation shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons that the ‘good cause’ exception applies.”). albeit relying on a different justification within the exception than that which this Note focuses on.",

Part I provides an overview of the existing tools for public participation in the rulemaking process, namely notice and comment; the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); and off-the-record consultation between senior agency officials and their industry contacts, what this Note refers to as “Rolodex Rulemaking.” Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders’ involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.",

Licari, Public Administration: Power and Politics in the Fourth Branch of Government passim (2006). are an extension of the democratically elected president and the executive branch, those same citizens who elect their president should have a voice in agency actions. What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts’ current expectations. The statutory requirements of notice and comment are minimal; however, case law has expanded those requirements beyond what is feasible for agencies today and beyond what the drafters of the APA envisioned.",

      "text": "The phrase notice-and-comment rulemaking refers to the process an agency undertakes when it publishes notice of a proposed rule or regulation in the Federal Register; opens the proposed rule up for public comment; and then reviews those comments, addressing any of particular substance in its final rule. 13 Admin. Conf. of the U.S., Info. Interchange Bull. No. 014, Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking (2021). The final step of addressing comments in the final rule is not articulated in the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. Legislators included this process—albeit a bare-bones one—in the APA “to permit [the] introduction of evidence relevant to the topic and argument about the proposed rule” through “advance notice to the public and a public hearing.” 14 Cass, supra note 4, at 696. The second component of the process, a public hearing, is required only when an agency participates in formal rulemaking, as described in section 553 of the APA. 15 See supra note 2 for more on the distinction between informal and formal rulemaking. A public hearing during formal rulemaking, unlike notice and comment, takes place in person and resembles a courtroom proceeding, with a judge, testimony, and cross-examination. For more on the formal rulemaking process, see Kent Barnett, Looking More Closely at the Platypus of Formal Rulemaking , The Regulatory Review (May 11, 2017), https://www.theregreview.org/2017/05/11/barnett-platypus-formal-rulemaking [ perma.cc/7FGV-35CW ].

Fla. E. Coast Ry., 410 U.S. 224 (1973).

Shepherd, Fierce Compromise: The Administrative Procedure Act Emerges from New Deal Politics , 90 Nw. U. L. Rev . 1557, 1583 (1996)). Cass’s article provides a helpful primer on the legislative history of the APA, the view of notice and comment at the time of the Act’s passage, and its evolution. As rulemaking became more frequent in the 1960s and ’70s, 25 The annual number of pages in the Federal Register more than quintupled in fifteen years during this period, increasing from about 17,000 pages in 1965 to over 87,000 pages in 1980.

Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 547–48 (1978) (“[U]nwarranted judicial examination of perceived procedural shortcomings of a rulemaking proceeding can do nothing but seriously interfere with that process prescribed by Congress.”). The Court in recent years has leaned heavily on Vermont Yankee to remind circuit courts that they should not impose requirements outside the confines of the statute. See infra Section III.C. For an agency to be sure its rule will survive a legal challenge, it must be prepared to respond to accusations that it did not address comments of “cogent materiality.” 28 United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 252 (2d Cir. 1977); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 48–49 (1983). Although the Second Circuit first introduced this concept in Nova Scotia , 29 The D.C. Circuit was arguably the first to impose requirements on an agency outside of the confines of the text of the APA. See Portland Cement Ass’n v. Ruckelshaus, 486 F.2d 375 (D.C. Cir. 1973). But the D.C. Circuit’s requirements did not achieve a national scale the way the Second Circuit’s Nova Scotia rule did. the Supreme Court endorsed the approach in its landmark State Farm decision. This move created one of today’s greatest notice-and-comment challenges for an agency: It must read every comment to ensure it does not miss comments of cogent materiality. Any comments meeting that standard must be addressed either by engaging with the commenter, incorporating the feedback into a final rule, or explaining why the agency did not incorporate the comment into the final rule. Of course, this type of engagement (in moderation) is the exact reason the APA included a notice-and-comment requirement in the first place. 30 See Donald J. Kochan, The Commenting Power: Agency Accountability Through Public Participation , 70 Okla. L. Rev. 601, 606 (2018). An agency should listen to and engage with stakeholders throughout the rulemaking process, especially when their comments are objectively material. The crux of the problem today is the ease with which participants can manipulate the comment process, especially in the modern internet age, to waste agency time and resources. 31 This development will be discussed in more detail infra in Part II.",

First, opportunities to manipulate the system through technological advances have rapidly expanded.

Although new technology has helped achieve those goals, that achievement has come at a price: increased mass comment campaigns.

Although mass comment campaigns existed before the technological advances of e-rulemaking, the internet has made it even easier for these organizations to overwhelm agencies with thousands of duplicative comments. 49 Id. Professor Mendelson provides examples of some extreme cases of mass comment campaigns, including agency rules that received upward of a million comments during the notice-and-comment process. Early scholarship in the wake of these technological advances suggested that agencies would not necessarily be as responsive to these mass comment campaigns as they would be to “sophisticated comments.” 50 See, e.g. , id. at 1362–64. However, more recent studies demonstrate that even if mass comment campaigns rarely result in substantive changes to a final rule, agencies tend to be at least procedurally responsive to these campaigns. 51 See, e.g. , Aryamala Prasad, Are Agencies Responsive to Mass Comment Campaigns? , Regul.

This layering of inaccessibility and increased workload for agencies creates litigation opportunities. Litigants take advantage of the courts’ posture favoring increased procedure in notice and comment. As a result, agencies do not have enough time, people, or money to handle the beast that notice and comment has become. Agencies have finite resources granted through appropriators and authorizers. 73 See generally James V. Saturno, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46497, Authorizations and the Appropriations Process (2023). Absent a massive influx of cash or hiring authority, 74 A number of legal scholars have proposed legislative reform as the solution to this problem (which could be an influx of cash or hiring authority by appropriators or authorizers or could be reforming the APA itself to make clear that the stringent notice-and-comment requirements made by the courts are not required by statute).

Given the challenges with notice and comment, the issue seems ripe for review. However, even if the Court does not take up this question directly, there is room for agencies to rely more heavily on good cause rulemaking. They should combine the good cause exception with tools of public engagement that are less cumbersome and flawed than notice and comment to demonstrate to the courts that they are attempting to bypass not the purpose of notice and comment but instead the flawed process itself.

      "text": "The strategy of invoking the good cause exception alongside modern public engagement methods to replace notice and comment will need to be battle-tested in court. Given the evolving nature of administrative law today, 97 See Aaron Baum, How Much of the Regulatory State Is Safe PostLoper Bright ? , Harv. L.

Alternatively, it is possible to see a court understanding an agency’s attempt to bypass notice and comment for other public engagement mechanisms as, in and of itself, an interpretation of its statutory authority and requirements under the APA. Under Loper Bright , courts would not need to defer to the agency’s understanding of “impracticable” under the APA and could reject a case on these grounds. See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024). it seems as good a time as any for an agency to try its hand at moving the courts on this issue. The way a court will react to this new strategy depends on a number of factors, including, inter alia, the rule that is challenged, the party bringing the challenge, which court the challenge is brought in, 98 This is particularly important in today’s hyper-politicized environment.

Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367 (2020). Considering a set of regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Affordable Care Act addressing an employer’s obligations to provide contraceptive access through insurance plans, the majority opinion 109 Justice Thomas wrote the opinion, and Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined. Id. provided the Court’s clearest view in recent years on the role of the good cause exception and the nature of section 553. The agency used the good cause exception to promulgate the relevant rules, and the Court described the good cause exception as a provision that “permits an agency to dispense with notice and comment and promulgate an [interim final rule (IFR)] that carries immediate legal force.” 110 Little Sisters , 140 S. Ct. at 2374. The Court here describes the good cause exception as it applies to IFRs because those are the rules that HHS promulgated in this case. Nothing else in the opinion would suggest that they do not also view the good cause exception as providing the same leeway to an agency to promulgate a non-interim final rule without notice and comment. The Court’s offhand characterization here of the good cause exception stands in direct contrast to the Ninth Circuit’s staunch distaste for it in Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan , 958 F.2d 1479, 1487 (9th Cir. 1992). See supra note 79 and accompanying text. The Court also showed its hand on its view of the existing procedural requirements (both statutory and judge-made) with the use of one key word while describing the nature of notice-and-comment rulemaking: often.

The Court chose instead to focus on the fact that employing the good cause exception rather than notice and comment created no prejudicial error, and, therefore, did not procedurally invalidate the rules themselves. 113 Id. at 2385 (“Even assuming that the APA requires an agency to publish a document entitled ‘notice of proposed rulemaking’ when the agency moves from an IFR to a final rule, there was no ‘prejudicial error’ here. § 706.

The Court did not find the respondents’ arguments compelling and held that the rule was in line with APA requirements. 114 Id. at 2386. The Court’s reasoning in Little Sisters gives some indication that, as long as bypassing the comment side of notice and comment under the good cause exception creates no prejudicial error, 115 As would be the case if the agency implemented alternate means of public engagement, see supra in Section III.B. the Court would allow it.",

An agency has two mechanisms it can use to circumvent these judge-made requirements: one statutory—through the APA’s good cause exception—and one functional—through this Note’s recommendations for innovative public engagement efforts. By combining these two approaches, an agency can accomplish the democratic processes envisioned by the drafters of the APA without the procedural obstacles created fifty years ago by judges. The only remaining question is whether the Supreme Court will allow it. The political landscape of administrative law jurisprudence seems to point towards yes.
