The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor’s prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law—why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",

Faced with widespread tort liabilities, large corporations have often declared bankruptcy, forcing tort claimants to accept pennies on the dollar as compensation for their injuries. 1 See Abbe R. Gluck, Elizabeth Chamblee Burch & Adam S. Zimmerman, Against Bankruptcy: Public Litigation Values Versus the Endless Quest for Global Peace in Mass Litigation , 133 Yale L.J.F. 525, 527–28 (2024) (describing the “unprecedented number” of tort defendants, many of which “are not even financially distressed,” that have filed for bankruptcy “to compensate for what their court filings call the ‘failure’ of traditional litigation to expeditiously extinguish all lawsuits”); see also Luke Sperduto, Three and a Half Rules for Tort Claims in (and out of) Chapter 11 , 95 Am. Bankr. L.J. 127, 129–30 (2021) (“When a corporation files for bankruptcy due to tort liabilities, tort claimants often recover a smaller share of what they are owed than the company’s secured creditors. This is because tort claims are general unsecured claims, which are subordinate to secured claims under state law and the United States Bankruptcy Code.”). This compensatory problem is brought into sharp relief by the Supreme Court’s recent decision involving Purdue Pharma L.P.’s bankruptcy after it faced at least $40 trillion of potential tort liabilities for manufacturing and distributing Oxycontin, the highly addictive pain killer largely responsible for triggering the opioid-overdose crisis. 2 Harrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2098 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). For further discussion of this case, see infra notes 186–187 and accompanying text. Although the case turned on the statutory powers of federal bankruptcy courts, 3 Id. at 2084. it painfully illustrates how bankruptcy affects tort compensation. Under the plan the bankruptcy court approved, “if people experienced a potentially deadly addiction that could be linked to a Purdue prescription, they may receive the minimum payout, $3,500—a paltry sum.” 4 Ryan Hampton, The Sacklers Are Walking Off into the Sunset.

This “glaring gap” extends beyond liability insurance and implicates the deeper question concerning the available resources for compensating tortiously caused injuries: Whereas liability insurance increases compensatory resources, bankruptcy reduces them.

A large part of the difficulty arises from the firmly established rule that a defendant’s financial ability to pay for a judgment “is not alone sufficient to justify legal responsibility . . . and this overarching principle must be taken into account” within substantive tort law. 8 Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F.2d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 1968) (citation omitted) (discussing the proper formulation of vicarious liability); see also, e.g. , Fed. R. Evid. 411 (“Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.”).

To further establish the baseline proposition that substantive tort law depends on the general availability of compensatory resources, Part II asks what the common law would look like under conditions of unlimited compensatory resources and perfect injury compensation. This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a “social currency” that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injury-causing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",

By utilizing ordinary money as a form of social currency for enforcing legal obligations within the realm of injury compensation, the common law imbued the monetary damages remedy with a duality of normative meaning that persists to this day—it is both crassly commercial and a normative measure of fair compensation.

Recognizing this problem, the common law treats premature death and other bodily injuries as irreparable harms that are best prevented ex ante instead of being compensated ex post with the inherently inadequate monetary damages remedy. The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury. The normative importance of injury prevention, in turn, justifies both punitive damages and criminal punishment for culpable forms of injury-causing behavior. The compensatory limitations of tort liability accordingly shape the criminal law, contradicting the conventional account that treats tort law as the civilized outgrowth of the punitive practices that organize the criminal law.",

Under the early common law, a judgment that rendered the defendant insolvent was not simply a financial matter. The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment. 13 See infra notes 108–114 and accompanying text. Debtor’s prison—a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century 14 See Peter J. Coleman, Debtors and Creditors in America: Insolvency, Imprisonment for Debt, and Bankruptcy, 1607–1900 , at 256 (1974) (“Between 1811 and the end of Reconstruction most but not all of the eastern states gradually prohibited the imprisonment of defaulters except in cases of fraud and in damage suits for alimony, child support, and wrongful behavior.”). —supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability. Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant’s culpability. The subsequent emergence of modern bankruptcy law eliminated the burden of criminal punishment from this normative calculus.

For example, in a tort case involving an automobile driver who accidentally injured a pedestrian, the court must determine whether the pedestrian’s interest in bodily security is prioritized over the driver’s conflicting liberty interest. If so, tort law can justifiably shift the injury costs from the plaintiff’s (prioritized) interest onto the defendant’s (legally subordinate) interest by way of a judgment for compensatory damages. Absent such a priority, tort law cannot, in principle, shift the injury costs from the plaintiff to the defendant; the loss must instead lie where it fell, absolving the defendant from liability. 20 Once a loss has already occurred, “whatever benefit might be derived from repairing the fortunes of one person is exactly offset by the harm caused through taking that amount away from another.” Id. at 4. Consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff’s impaired interest over the defendant’s conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm. In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. “Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.” Id. These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff’s protected, injured interest over the defendant’s conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner. The burden of proof then maintains the integrity of this priority. The plaintiff must prove the elements of the prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence. When the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.

Alternatively, the substantive balancing principle could be based on the concern for equal wealth distribution, in which case the less wealthy interest would be prioritized over a conflicting wealthier interest. Another approach translates the varied interests into measures of individual utility or welfare that must receive equal treatment when plugged into a social welfare function, requiring courts to balance conflicting interests in a manner that minimizes the social cost of accidents to maximize social welfare.

A defendant’s financial ability to pay for the tort judgment does not justify tort liability. 34 See supra note 8 and accompanying text. Instead, a defendant’s wealth, along with the opportunity to insure against tort liability, is relevant for attaining the efficient and fair distribution of resources across society. 35 Differences in individual wealth obviously matter for social schemes of redistributing wealth across society. Liability insurance is relevant to the socially efficient allocation of resources. See Tom Baker & Peter Siegelman, The Law and Economics of Liability Insurance: A Theoretical and Empirical Review , in Research Handbook on the Economics of Torts 169, 174 (Jennifer H. Arlen ed. 2013) (according to “canonical” economic model, the optimal outcome involves insurance contracts that shift risks “away from risk-averse parties who find bearing them costly” within a legal regime of liability rules that “provide both injurers and victims with incentives to take optimal care, and engage optimally in risky activities”). How, then, could the availability of compensatory resources be a normatively relevant factor for determining the duty a defendant in principle owed to the plaintiff right-holder? The apparently obvious negative answer to this question may explain why scholars so far have assumed that liability insurance—and by extension, the availability of compensatory resources—can factor into substantive tort law only as a matter of policy, not principle. 36 See, e.g. , Abraham & Sharkey, supra note 6, at 2243; Weinrib, supra note 9, at 684 (“Deploying insurance considerations to resolve tort disputes . . . entails an instrumentalist and legislative conception of law.”); see also Zhong Xing Tan, The Enigma of Interpersonal Justice in Private Law Theory , 43 Oxford J.

By definition, the formulation of a general tort duty is categorical in nature; it applies equally to everyone within the general category of cases the duty governs.

On one account, social currency naturally fit this bill and evolved into the medium of exchange for trade between clans and other kinds of communities. 72 Paul Einzig, Primitive Money: In Its Ethnological, Historical and Economic Aspects 380 (2d ed. 1966) (“The payment of blood money between tribes must have largely contributed towards the origin of inter-tribal currencies which, in turn, must have led to the development of currencies on a nation-wide scale. It provided probably the earliest inducement for the development of an agreed monetary unit between two communities.”); Graeber , supra note 46, at 45 (“The problem [with the claim that barter economies preceded the origins of money] is that history shows that without money, such vast barter systems do not occur.”). Another account locates the origins of money in the early state, which issued coins and the like as the means for subjects to pay taxes or tributes in exchange for services. 73 Skidelsky, supra note 12, at 25–26. According to the “dominant model of the origins of law and the state,” the most important service the early state provided was to protect individuals and provide them with legal avenues for injury redress. 74 See Whitman, supra note 45, at 41–43.

The only way to punish a corporate wrongdoer—the cause of widespread injury in modern society—is by inflicting financial pain through a tort award of punitive damages.

Risky conduct threatening fatal harms routinely threatens other bodily injuries as well, and liability for those injuries enables the duty to meaningfully protect against the threat of premature death. 139 Courts have recognized as much in other contexts, such as the rule limiting a manufacturer’s liability for pure economic losses. See Trans States Airlines v. Pratt & Whitney Can., Inc., 682 N.E.2d 45, 53 (Ill. 1997) (“[W]e believe that the incentive to manufacture safe products remains unabated under the [rule barring recovery for pure economic losses]. . . .

A defendant who consciously disregards the obligation to exercise reasonable care also faces the prospect of punitive damages, a remedy that helps to maintain the integrity of the primary duty to exercise reasonable care. See infra Section IV.C. But in the absence of such reprehensible behavior, tort law does not award punitive damages.

Consumers purchase these policies regardless of their entitlement to tort compensation for product-caused injuries. Their ability to recover compensatory damages for the medical expenses of treating these injuries does not obviate their need to purchase broader insurance covering medical expenses unrelated to product-caused injuries, like those for treating diseases, illnesses, and so on. Rather than providing these right-holders with a valuable source of injury compensation, an entitlement to tort compensation routinely provides them with duplicative insurance. And because plaintiffs cannot recover for the same injury from both their insurer and the tort defendant, separate proceedings (subrogation actions) are required to eliminate double recoveries. 173 See, e.g. , Associated Hosp. Serv. v. Pustilnik, 439 A.2d 1149, 1150 (Pa. 1981) (enforcing subrogation claim by a health insurer with respect to reimbursed medical expenses that a tort defendant had also compensated).

See generally Mark A. Geistfeld, Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts: Carrying Calabresi Further , J.L. & Contemp. Probs. , no. 2, 2014, at 165 (showing how a compensatory norm generates tort rules that adequately satisfy the demands of the Pareto principle for social interactions constrained by transaction costs). As for the central normative importance of the Pareto principle for welfarist interpretations of tort law, see Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Fairness Versus Welfare 54–56, 54 n.76 (2002) for an argument that any nonwelfarist rationale for tort law violates the Pareto principle and should be rejected for that reason. A purely compensatory rule reorients the welfarist inquiry from allocative efficiency, or cost minimization, to Pareto optimality. The reasons for doing so are internal to the logic of welfarism. 186 The requisite logic is inherent within cost-benefit analysis. For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 Theoretical Inquiries L. 387, 394–96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder’s willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.

For cases in which right-holders ultimately bear the costs of the correlative tort duties, a purely compensatory tort rule would be contrary to their interests; it would unduly increase the ordinary right-holder’s total costs of injury compensation. The relevant interests of these right-holders are best protected by deterrence-based liability rules obligating risky actors to prevent injuries through the exercise of reasonable care. Compensatory rules of strict liability can only fairly or reasonably protect right-holders who do not ultimately pay for their tort entitlements to compensation, providing another important example of how the scarcity of compensatory resources shapes substantive tort law.",

As was true for the customary practices that first informed the early common law, an injurer’s failure to compensate the victim’s injury can be a culpable form of disrespect or mistreatment, regardless of whether the injury was otherwise due to faulty behavior—the “value of an eye for an eye.” 202 See, e.g. , Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments 104 (D.D. Raphael & A.L. Macfie eds., 6th ed. 1976) (1790) (observing that an injurer with “any sensibility . . . necessarily desires to compensate the damage,” for to “offer no atonement, is regarded as the highest brutality”); Emily Sherwin, Interpreting Tort Law , 39 Fla.

In either case, what triggers resentment is not the injurer’s initial conduct toward the victim (which does not invite blame), but the injurer’s failure to suffer its consequences.”). Over time, this compensatory practice evolved into the important rules comprising modern tort law, including the rule of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities. For these and related nonculpable forms of injury-causing behavior, the defendant’s payment of compensatory damages fully satisfies the normative obligation, eliminating any normative concern about using liability insurance as a funding mechanism.",

Rather than focus on how liability these days might be excessive for duty-bearers—a questionable concern since the injuries in question are a proximate cause of a defendant’s negligence—the inquiry can instead look at the extent of liability from the perspective of right-holders. The total amount of the ordinary duty-bearer’s compensatory resources will often not be sufficient to cover the claims of each physically harmed victim and the ten or more others who, as a foreseeable consequence, are emotionally distressed or have incurred pure economic loss. In that event, liability would be excessive for exhausting the negligent defendant’s financial resources and preventing the physically harmed victims from being fully compensated.",

The sprawling litigation over tort liabilities for asbestos-containing products that cause fatal cancers provides an extreme example. These liabilities bankrupted numerous corporations, including some of the largest in the country, which then set up trusts to distribute the remaining available assets to tort claimants. 234 See generally Francis E. McGovern, The Evolution of Asbestos Bankruptcy Trust Distribution Plans , 62 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 163 (2006) (describing various trust arrangements following bankruptcy stemming from asbestos-related liabilities of more than 70 corporations since 1982). For nearly all trusts with assets to distribute, claimants receive anywhere from 1.1% to less than 60% of the full, liquidated value of the tort claim. 235 See Lloyd Dixon, Geoffrey McGovern & Amy Coombe, RAND Corp. , Asbestos Bankruptcy Trusts: An Overview of Trust Structure and Activity with Detailed Reports on the Largest Trusts 21, 38 fig. 4.5 (2010) (identifying only one trust that pays above this amount). Many trusts distributed all their assets and can no longer compensate tort claimants for their cancers. 236 For example, the Manville Personal Injury Trust “was insolvent just a few years after it was created.” Id. at 6. Though extreme, the asbestos problem is symptomatic of a more fundamental compensatory problem. In 2022, a study spanning ten industry sectors, ranging from Life Sciences to Chemicals, found the median policy limit for liability insurance was uniformly below the trended liability loss costs, typically around half the total, with the largest discrepancy (Rail–Transportation) involving a median policy limit around four times lower than projected liability costs. 237 Chubb, Liability Limit Benchmark & Large Loss Profile by Industry Sector 2023 (2023), https://chubb.com/content/dam/chubb-sites/chubb-com/bm-en/benchmark-report/pdf/chubb_2023benchmarkreport_10_bermuda-web.pdf [ perma.cc/ENV2-NSSC ].

      "text": "The basic idea is that physical harm is usually normatively worse than emotional distress or financial loss. Of course, some bodily injuries quickly heal, whereas some emotional harms and financial losses are debilitating. But as a categorical matter—the appropriate analytical frame for duty purposes—bodily injuries are worse than these other harms. Physical harm also encompasses damage to real or tangible property, which raises issues that require a more extended explanation of why these kinds of losses are worse than the others, particularly those involving intangible forms of property (like money). A key difference is that the monetary damages can fully repair pure economic losses (a dollar is a dollar). By contrast, real or tangible personal property (like one’s house and the personal items it contains) is not ordinarily a fully fungible commodity with other items in the marketplace and cannot be fully repaired with compensatory damages. 241 See generally Janice Nadler, The Social Psychology of Property: Looking Beyond Market Exchange , 14 Ann. Rev. L. & Soc. Sci. 367 (2018) (providing empirical evidence and discussing various social and moral influences that explain why market prices do not fully capture individual valuations of tangible and real property); see also, e.g., Margaret Jane Radin, Property and Personhood , 34 Stan. L. Rev. 957, 959 (1982) (arguing that tangible forms of property “are part of the way we constitute ourselves as continuing personal entities in the world”); O. W. Holmes, The Path of the Law , 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 477 (1897) (“A thing which you have enjoyed and used as your own for a long time . . . takes root in your being and cannot be torn away . . . . The law can ask for no better justification than the deepest instincts of man.”) (discussing adverse possession). Commercial property requires different analysis. Businesses do not own their employees and are not entitled to compensatory damages when someone negligently injures an employee. See, e.g. , Cont’l Cas. Co. v. P.D.C., Inc., 931 F.2d 1429, 1431 (10th Cir. 1991) (denying such recovery in part on the ground that “a majority of jurisdictions . . . have refused to do so in similar situations”). Consequently, if the economic loss rule barred tort recovery for all forms of commercial property damage on the ground that these properties are fungible commodities like money, then the tort duty to exercise reasonable care would effectively be negated as applied to commercial enterprises. Prioritizing physical harms over pure economic losses and stand-alone emotional distress is a normatively defensible position.",

Consequently, in the absence of any legal priority of the plaintiff’s impaired interest over the defendant’s conflicting interest, a defendant subject to liability could then sue to re-shift the loss back onto the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff caused the defendant to suffer this harm. In principle, the cycle would recur endlessly for any arbitrary shifting of the loss. “Hence, a shifting of loss is justified only when there exists special reason for requiring the defendant to bear it rather than the plaintiff on whom it happens to have fallen.” Id. These special reasons justify a legal priority of the plaintiff’s protected, injured interest over the defendant’s conflicting interest, with the priority providing the mechanism for shifting the loss in a nonarbitrary manner. The burden of proof then maintains the integrity of this priority. The plaintiff must prove the elements of the prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence. When the evidence is in equipoise, showing that there is a fifty-percent chance that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery and a fifty-percent chance that the defendant is not responsible, then the respective interests of the two parties are normatively indistinguishable, and the plaintiff must bear the loss.

Where the product causes personal injury or other property damage, the manufacturer may yet be subject to liability in tort. Because no manufacturer can predict with any certainty that the damage his unsafe product causes will be confined to the product itself, tort liability will continue to loom as a possibility. Therefore, in our view, the incentive to build safe products is not diminished.”). A defendant who consciously disregards the obligation to exercise reasonable care also faces the prospect of punitive damages, a remedy that helps to maintain the integrity of the primary duty to exercise reasonable care. See infra Section IV.C. But in the absence of such reprehensible behavior, tort law does not award punitive damages. This property of the damages remedy accordingly rules out deterrence-based proposals to increase wrongful-death damages in all cases so that they account for the decedent’s loss of life’s pleasures. See Eric A. Posner & Cass R. Sunstein, Dollars and Death , 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 537, 542 (2005) (proposing that courts should take “account of the welfare loss to the decedent,” a change which “would significantly alter wrongful death cases by producing far higher recoveries in many cases”).",

The more interesting question is whether deterrence supplies a decisive reason for formulating the duty in this manner. It does. In the absence of a compensatory remedy for fatal harms, their prevention must be the decisive reason for including them in the duty.

For a purely compensatory entitlement, right-holders implicitly measure the cost of injury in terms of the minimum amount of money they would accept as compensation for facing the risk. Without any compensatory transfer, a right-holder would rationally and reasonably measure the associated injury costs at infinity. When plugged into cost-benefit analysis, an infinite measure of injury costs rules out the risky behavior and eliminates the prospect the right-holder will incur an uncompensated loss. Mark A. Geistfeld, The Tort Entitlement to Physical Security as the Distributive Basis for Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations , 15 Theoretical Inquiries L. 387, 394–96 (2014). Thus, in order for welfarism to justify risky interactions of this type, it must enforce the compensatory transfer that underlies the right-holder’s willingness to accept compensation in order to face the risk. The appropriate welfarist evaluation of the compensatory transfer is based on the Pareto principle, not on the cost-benefit analysis for identifying allocatively efficient outcomes.",

The law can ask for no better justification than the deepest instincts of man.”) (discussing adverse possession). Commercial property requires different analysis. Businesses do not own their employees and are not entitled to compensatory damages when someone negligently injures an employee. See, e.g. , Cont’l Cas. Co. v. P.D.C., Inc., 931 F.2d 1429, 1431 (10th Cir. 1991) (denying such recovery in part on the ground that “a majority of jurisdictions . . . have refused to do so in similar situations”). Consequently, if the economic loss rule barred tort recovery for all forms of commercial property damage on the ground that these properties are fungible commodities like money, then the tort duty to exercise reasonable care would effectively be negated as applied to commercial enterprises.",
