Purdue Pharma L.P. 1 is about whether the text of the United States Bankruptcy Code gives courts the authority to approve nonconsensual third-party releases in Chapter 11. 2 Section 1123(b)(6) of the Code allows Chapter 11 plans of reorganization to “include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.” 3 The question posed to the Court in Purdue was whether that language encompasses nonconsensual third-party releases. The majority concluded it does not. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for a four-Justice dissent, disagreed.",

All courts exercise discretion and fill gaps, and bankruptcy court discretion is firmly rooted in the text of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to de novo review in an Article III tribunal. 8 Still, since the Code was enacted, the concern that bankruptcy courts possess too much authority and too much discretion has been the basis of numerous constitutional decisions limiting the power of bankruptcy courts.",

For example, Section 1123(b)(6) gives a bankruptcy court authority to approve a plan that includes “any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.” 40 Section 1112(b) allows a court to dismiss a case “for cause.” 41 Section 364(d) provides that a court “may authorize” the debtor to obtain credit if certain conditions are met, including a finding that the affected parties have received “adequate protection.” 42 Section 510(c) provides that a court “may under principles of equitable subordination, subordinate an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest to all or part of another allowed interest.” 43 Section 1129(a) requires that a plan of reorganization have been “proposed in good faith.” 44 And Section 1129(b) requires that a nonconsensual plan be “fair and equitable” and that it not “discriminate unfairly” to be approved. 45 These provisions all explicitly delegate policymaking authority and discretion to bankruptcy courts, establishing clear statutory grounds for flexible and responsive judicial decision-making.",

During his confirmation hearings, one of his Tenth Circuit dissenting opinions refusing to find an equitable exception to a statute was widely criticized. The case—commonly referred to as the “frozen trucker case”—involved a truck driver who was fired for driving his employer’s truck to safety to avoid life-threatening cold. The majority of the Tenth Circuit upheld findings by the Department of Labor (DOL) and an administrative law judge (ALJ) that the termination violated a law prohibiting discharge where an employee “refuses to operate a vehicle” because of unsafe conditions. TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Admin. Rev. Bd., 833 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2016). Then-Judge Gorsuch dissented, explaining that the driver operated the vehicle and the statute only protected refusal to operate . He explained that neither the DOL, nor the ALJ, nor the Tenth Circuit had the power to read an exception into the statute. Far from labeling the majority as “exceptionalist” for its broad interpretation, critics viewed Gorsuch’s position as the exception. One scholar argued that Gorsuch’s approach revealed that that he might be unfit for the Supreme Court. Jed Shugerman, Neil Gorsuch and the ‘Frozen Trucker,’ Slate (Mar. 21, 2017, 10:38 AM), https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/neil-gorsuchs-arrogant-frozen-trucker-opinion-shows-he-wants-to-be-like-scalia.html . Justice Gorsuch’s reasoning in the frozen trucker case is of a kind with his Purdue opinion. Both are formalist approaches exhibiting a distrust of judicial discretion exercised in the first instance by non-Article III judges.

This drafter wants plans to conform with all the requirements set forth explicitly in other provisions of the Code, especially Section 1129. But beyond that, the drafter wants to give the parties and the courts leeway. How would that drafter accomplish her objective? Section 1123(b)(6) provides that a plan can approve any appropriate provisions not inconsistent with other provisions of the Code. That is the most direct way of achieving this hypothetical drafter’s objective. By our reading, the other items listed in Sections 1123(b)(1)–(5) are specific things that the drafters worried might be viewed by courts as inconsistent with other provisions. So they specifically listed them as allowable. Perhaps a more adept drafter would have put Section 1123(b)(6) first to convey the point. Beyond that option, there are not many other ways to say that parties can include any appropriate provisions in a plan as long as they are not prohibited elsewhere. Justice Gorsuch avoids this problem by assuming that the question is not how a drafter would grant broad authority that includes releases but rather how a drafter would specifically authorize these exact types of releases. Those are meaningfully different drafting goals. The Court’s approach requires Congress to add to the Section 1123(b) list as every case reveals a new option. That approach undermines the discretionary language, and, by the Court’s logic, every addition further constrains discretion and narrows the set of other appropriate provisions.",
