This is the first appearance of the phrase “notice and receipt of public comment” in the APA. That phrase appears five times in the statute before a transition to the phrase “notice and opportunity for public comment” in §&nbsp;552a(v)(1). It is not until §&nbsp;563(a)(7), added in a later amendment to the APA, that the exact phrase “notice and comment” first appears, and it does so only twice, both in the context of a “negotiated rulemaking committee,” which allows “[a]n agency [to] establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to negotiate and develop a proposed rule, if the head of the agency determines that the use of the negotiated rulemaking procedure is in the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. §&nbsp;563–564. The original text of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§&nbsp;551–559, never uses the exact phrase “notice and comment,” as used by judges and legal scholars. The phrase only emerges in later amendments such as §&nbsp;563.<br></span> What has been seemingly lost on many is that the APA itself creates virtually no requirements for agencies other than a handful of vague references to “notice and receipt of public comment” throughout the statute.<a id="_Ref191551158"></a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--expands-on-desktop " data-mfn="4" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000002e800000000000000000_41270"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000002e800000000000000000_41270-4">4</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000002e800000000000000000_41270-4" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="4"><em>See </em>Ronald A.

Part I provides an overview of the existing tools for public participation in the rulemaking process, namely notice and comment; the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); and off-the-record consultation between senior agency officials and their industry contacts, what this Note refers to as “Rolodex Rulemaking.” Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders’ involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.</p><h2><a id="_Toc191659230"></a><a id="_Toc205813924"></a>I.

What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts’ current expectations. The statutory requirements of notice and comment are minimal; however, case law has expanded those requirements beyond what is feasible for agencies today and beyond what the drafters of the APA envisioned.</p><h3><a id="_Toc191659231"></a><a id="_Toc205813925"></a>A.

However, these higher-level sessions should be made available to any organization with a stake in the matter, so long as they can send a representative from the appropriate level—making the higher-level sessions truly open and avoiding the trap of Rolodex Rulemaking.

But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA’s original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers’ lives simpler.

That failure is not due to any statute but rather to the judges that, over the last half century, handicapped agencies through a series of cases the Supreme Court largely has declined to apply. An agency has two mechanisms it can use to circumvent these judge-made requirements: one statutory—through the APA’s good cause exception—and one functional—through this Note’s recommendations for innovative public engagement efforts. By combining these two approaches, an agency can accomplish the democratic processes envisioned by the drafters of the APA without the procedural obstacles created fifty years ago by judges. The only remaining question is whether the Supreme Court will allow it. The political landscape of administrative law jurisprudence seems to point towards yes. This Court has made its interest in reshaping administrative law doctrine apparent, and this Note’s proposal would not only reshape but re-democratize public participation in the informal rulemaking process.</p><hr /><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>* <em>J.D.
