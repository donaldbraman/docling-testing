        <h2><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761986"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499973"></a> Introduction</h2>
<p>Discovery disputes are endemic to pretrial practice. But if you scan law-school casebooks or the decisions of the Supreme Court, you won’t find many appellate orders addressing discovery disputes.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111551839"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-8648-footnote-2">[1]</a></sup> The few exceptions are cases like <em>Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-8648-footnote-3">[2]</a></sup> which is intertwined with constitutional considerations, or <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-4" href="#post-8648-footnote-4">[3]</a></sup> which involves an important common-law doctrine and is an interesting outlier (the rare trial-level en banc decision!) in many ways.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-5" href="#post-8648-footnote-5">[4]</a></sup> The Supreme Court issued two opinions directly deciding discovery issues in 2022—the first since 2017.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-6" href="#post-8648-footnote-6">[5]</a></sup> But these are the exceptions illuminating, if not proving, the rule that discovery disputes rarely receive grants of certiorari. Even there, the discovery questions involved foreign relations and national security, two separate, high-profile issues.</p>
<p>The general absence of discovery decisions from legal education and the Supreme Court’s docket is consistent with the common perception that the federal appellate courts take a hands-off approach to discovery in civil litigation, perhaps fueled by a view that discovery is not worth their time.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-7" href="#post-8648-footnote-7">[6]</a></sup> The lack of appellate oversight also may add to the impression that discovery functions like civil litigation’s Wild West, without meaningful error correction or law development.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552266"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-8" href="#post-8648-footnote-8">[7]</a></sup> The absence of formal appellate discovery decisions, however, is not the full story.</p>
<p>Three existing lines of scholarship have responded to the concerns about the dearth of appellate discovery decisions. One line identifies how federal appellate courts have long recognized a few select issues in discovery as being worthy of their attention.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554833"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-9" href="#post-8648-footnote-9">[8]</a></sup> A second line notes that, for the majority of discovery questions left unaddressed, trial-level decisions may percolate and create a body of law, which fills the void left by the appellate courts.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111551879"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-10" href="#post-8648-footnote-10">[9]</a></sup> A third line explores how civil litigants and their lawyers have a role in defining the law that effectively controls discovery.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554915"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-11" href="#post-8648-footnote-11">[10]</a></sup> While this scholarship individually and collectively provides a rich account of discovery, the literature still overwhelmingly accepts the premise that trial courts are left without much oversight when it comes to discovery issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-12" href="#post-8648-footnote-12">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>This Article challenges the consensus view that discovery happens in a “vertical vacuum.”<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554746"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-13" href="#post-8648-footnote-13">[12]</a></sup> First, in the Roberts era, pivotal references to discovery appear in a significant number of the Court’s decisions.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-14" href="#post-8648-footnote-14">[13]</a></sup> Most notably, <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-15" href="#post-8648-footnote-15">[14]</a></sup> and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-16" href="#post-8648-footnote-16">[15]</a></sup> changed the pleading standard in federal court because of concerns about the ostensible cost of discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-17" href="#post-8648-footnote-17">[16]</a></sup> In this manner, discovery acted like the “legal equivalent of dark matter, which can be observed . . . through its gravitational effect upon other bodies.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-18" href="#post-8648-footnote-18">[17]</a></sup> Put another way, at the Supreme Court-level, discovery is most easily seen by its influence on non-discovery jurisprudence. Second, the Court’s discovery dicta then radiate back out as trial-level courts cite these non-discovery cases in their discovery orders. As such, we see how the Roberts Court uses its soft authority—through dicta and other commentary—to signal its views on discovery policy and guide the trial-level courts’ application of the law, effectively, if informally, fulfilling its traditional appellate role.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-19" href="#post-8648-footnote-19">[18]</a></sup> Third, the rising use of magistrate judges has created another unheralded body of de facto appellate decisions on discovery disputes: district judges’ oversight of magistrate judges instead of appellate judges’ supervision of district judges.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-20" href="#post-8648-footnote-20">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Akin to its “shadow docket,” the Supreme Court has a stealth jurisprudence of discovery in which it flexes its informal authority. Since Chief Justice Roberts joined the Court, it has heard just six discovery merits appeals, all of which presented policy issues that went beyond the mechanics of discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-21" href="#post-8648-footnote-21">[20]</a></sup> But concerns arising from bread-and-butter discovery have famously appeared in the Court’s decisions on pleading standards.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-22" href="#post-8648-footnote-22">[21]</a></sup> This Article uncovers how fears about the ostensible burdens of discovery are also used to justify decisions about jurisdiction, interbranch conflicts, First Amendment challenges, the reach of certain statutes, and other issues.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553601"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-23" href="#post-8648-footnote-23">[22]</a></sup> Furthermore, Chief Justice Roberts has used his year-end reports to opine on the role of discovery in civil litigation, offering cautionary notes about its costs.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552663"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-24" href="#post-8648-footnote-24">[23]</a></sup> At minimum, these mentions signal the Justices’ views on the normative and functional value of discovery. And those hints shape the analysis of the lower courts even if the Roberts Court’s antipathy to liberal discovery has not been fully adopted.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552314"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-25" href="#post-8648-footnote-25">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The soft authority of the Court is not the only way that the absence of appellate guidance is addressed, albeit without fanfare. Despite receiving limited scholarly attention, the frontline of discovery has changed.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552805"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-26" href="#post-8648-footnote-26">[25]</a></sup> Magistrate judges are now the first responders when it comes to managing discovery disputes in a significant number of districts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-27" href="#post-8648-footnote-27">[26]</a></sup> Their orders shape the collective understanding of the procedural rules that they interpret in the context of fact-rich, active disputes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-28" href="#post-8648-footnote-28">[27]</a></sup> And, critically, parties who lose on a discovery matter before a magistrate judge get a second bite at the apple—that is, they can seek to have the decision reviewed by a district court judge.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-29" href="#post-8648-footnote-29">[28]</a></sup> This second-level review provides some of the benefits of appellate review, and this Article highlights several instances in which this quasi-appellate structure seems to be working well.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-30" href="#post-8648-footnote-30">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>This Article makes both descriptive and conceptual contributions to the literature on civil discovery and the lack of formal appellate guidance in the federal courts. To the former, the Article details how review of on-the-ground discovery decisions functions at both ends of the judicial hierarchy and how the institutional actors understand their roles. In part, the Article creates a repository of cases in which the courts describe their visions of their own institutional competencies in addressing discovery issues. These firsthand accounts are then connected to the long-espoused scholarly theories of the functions of trial and appellate-level courts. It also collects examples in which the absence of appellate guidance has led to errors and has impeded the development of uniform law. Next, the Article surveys all of the references to discovery during the Roberts era, identifying discovery’s covert role in the Court’s jurisprudence. Additionally, it examines the extent to which the Court’s use of its soft authority is affecting decision-making on discovery issues by providing trial-level judges with a window into the Court’s view of the underlying principles and normative tradeoffs. It then looks at district judges’ evaluations of challenges to magistrate judges’ orders, highlighting examples where the district judges appear to be successfully correcting errors and clarifying the law.</p>
<p>As to its conceptual and prescriptive contributions, the Article explains how the descriptive findings illustrate how the functions of appellate review have been channeled in ways that are mostly consistent with institutional expertise instead of formal judicial hierarchy. The trial-level judges are given primary responsibility for the management of discovery disputes, including error correction and law clarification, by having district judges review the decisions of magistrate judges. At the other end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court uses its bully pulpit to make pronouncements about the normative tradeoffs implicated by common discovery disputes, which have, at least, some traction in the lower courts. While this jury-rigged system largely seems to be working, it has not been explicitly identified, and several developments are poised to disrupt the existing equilibrium.</p>
<p>Part I of the Article defines the issues. It explains the importance of discovery and describes the barriers to appeal. Part II describes the costs and benefits of this system design, noting how it is consistent with the assumed institutional expertise of the different courts and the courts’ own accounts of their competencies. Part III identifies the Roberts Court’s pronouncements on discovery across an array of sources, including formal decisions on discovery disputes, its dicta in non-discovery cases, and its bully pulpit. Part IV explores two different ways in which the judicial system is solving for the lack of formal appellate guidance on discovery. Drawing on the findings from Part III, it examines how lower courts integrate the Court’s discovery dicta into their actual practices. It also explains the rise of magistrate judges and sets forth the benefits of having the second-level review of the district court judges. The Article concludes with the implications of the makeshift system of error correction and law development, including some predictions about how it might soon be unsettled.</p>
<h2><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761987"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499974"></a> I. Discovery Appeals—Framing the Issue</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding its lack of appellate attention, discovery is a key aspect of civil litigation.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553393"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-31" href="#post-8648-footnote-31">[30]</a></sup> This Part begins by explaining the value of discovery to frame the importance of the absence of appellate guidance. It then describes the impediments to appeal.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc94372625"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc94728159"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761988"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499975"></a> A. Importance of Discovery</h3>
<p>An absence of formal appellate guidance in the case law governing civil discovery only matters if discovery matters. And the absence of appellate decisions on discovery might itself suggest that discovery is relatively unimportant. Such a view, though, fails to recognize how discovery serves a number of key roles in civil litigation and the regulation of entities’ primary conduct.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553452"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-32" href="#post-8648-footnote-32">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The instrumental value of discovery in civil litigation flows from the design of our pleading system, which does not require parties to possess all information necessary to prosecute or defend a claim at the outset of the suit.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-33" href="#post-8648-footnote-33">[32]</a></sup> As the Supreme Court itself acknowledged, “This simplified notice pleading standard <em>relies</em> on liberal discovery rules.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-34" href="#post-8648-footnote-34">[33]</a></sup> The disappearance of civil trials makes discovery even more significant because dispositive motions and settlement negotiations turn on the uncovered information.<a id="post-8648-_Ref116937595"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-35" href="#post-8648-footnote-35">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The process for the parties’ extraction and exchange of information helps define disputed facts and issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-36" href="#post-8648-footnote-36">[35]</a></sup> This, in turn, is classically understood to allow the parties to present or contest various claims and defenses as part of both the formal adjudication before the court and in settlement negotiations.</p>
<p>At the extreme end of usefulness, discovery may have an outcome-dispositive impact if, for example, one party holds a critical piece of evidence.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-37" href="#post-8648-footnote-37">[36]</a></sup> Illustrating the potential impact of discovery decisions, in a high-profile case from 1994, the plaintiff sued the defendant for making false representations about its photovoltaic system.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-38" href="#post-8648-footnote-38">[37]</a></sup> Discovery led to email messages that confirmed the defendant’s awareness of the problems with the photovoltaic system, essentially deciding the case.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-39" href="#post-8648-footnote-39">[38]</a></sup> The denial of access to discovery can also, in mirror-image fashion, have an outcome-dispositive influence. For example, if the claim requires expert testimony, a discovery sanction barring the use of an expert will de facto end the case.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-40" href="#post-8648-footnote-40">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>As one would expect, discovery does not have such extreme case-dispositive effects in every case—they might not even be the majority.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-41" href="#post-8648-footnote-41">[40]</a></sup> Even still, discovery may uncover information that can be used in settlement negotiations.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-42" href="#post-8648-footnote-42">[41]</a></sup> In the ideal world, the exchange of information through discovery may lead the parties to find new common ground if, for example, a party learns about the strengths of the opposing side’s claims or defenses.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-43" href="#post-8648-footnote-43">[42]</a></sup> Discovery may also expand the bargaining zone by forcing the disclosure of information that creates a reputational harm or risks exposing trade secrets.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553506"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-44" href="#post-8648-footnote-44">[43]</a></sup> And a common concern about discovery is that it can be used to foist the costs of production on the opposing party and, thus, obtain a nuisance-value settlement for a meritless claim.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111555781"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-45" href="#post-8648-footnote-45">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>The value of discovery in civil litigation goes beyond its instrumental value in defining claims and defenses.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-46" href="#post-8648-footnote-46">[45]</a></sup> It has long been understood that voice—that is, a party’s opportunity to tell their story to a decision maker—is positively correlated with the party’s sense of the fairness of the litigation procedures.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-47" href="#post-8648-footnote-47">[46]</a></sup> And “voice” is a key aspect of those procedures, even if it does not change the outcome.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553412"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-48" href="#post-8648-footnote-48">[47]</a></sup> With the disappearance of civil trials, motion practice and settlement negotiations are the decisive stages of litigation.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-49" href="#post-8648-footnote-49">[48]</a></sup> And it is during these times that litigants are consulted by their lawyers and are in some form of mediated dialogue with the court and opposing party, which should amplify the litigant’s voice and sense of dignity.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-50" href="#post-8648-footnote-50">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as discovery may provide parties with information to support their claims or defenses, the actual and potential court-forced disclosure of sensitive information may lead to regulatory action. Additionally, discovery may influence the primary behavior of regulated (or frequently sued) entities.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-51" href="#post-8648-footnote-51">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the American system, private litigants fulfill many of the functions served by state regulators in other countries.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-52" href="#post-8648-footnote-52">[51]</a></sup> For example, private litigants often play a primary role in enforcing federal civil rights statutes, ensuring socially important substantive rights without large state expenditures on bureaucracy.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-53" href="#post-8648-footnote-53">[52]</a></sup> And, as the designer of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure observed, private litigants’ use of liberal discovery rules in federal courts ultimately provides information to agencies and other state policymakers.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-54" href="#post-8648-footnote-54">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Regulatory discovery, in turn, may guide the primary conduct of entities that are either directly subject to regulations or otherwise have a high litigation risk.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-55" href="#post-8648-footnote-55">[54]</a></sup> Once discovery of misconduct becomes public, an entity might choose to change its behavior to ensure compliance with the substantive law and avoid future liability.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-56" href="#post-8648-footnote-56">[55]</a></sup> Such tradeoffs are well-illustrated by a case in which the Coca-Cola Company was ordered to disclose the formula for Coke—a tremendously valuable trade secret.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-57" href="#post-8648-footnote-57">[56]</a></sup> Rather than produce the formula, even under robust confidentiality protocols, Coca-Cola settled the case.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-58" href="#post-8648-footnote-58">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond its effect on parties, discovery is a key piece of the system of civil procedure.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111556774"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-59" href="#post-8648-footnote-59">[58]</a></sup> It is a lot of what trial judges do. Many years ago, the Federal Judicial Center conducted a study that found that district court judges spent about five percent of their case-related time on discovery matters.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553654"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-60" href="#post-8648-footnote-60">[59]</a></sup> Additionally, concerns about the expense of discovery and its impact on dockets drive other procedural decision-making by the courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-61" href="#post-8648-footnote-61">[60]</a></sup> Danya Shocair Reda coined the term “cost-and-delay narrative” to describe this long-standing view—a term that captures both the ostensible issues and their disconnect from empirical studies of litigation in the federal courts that do not show excessive costs or delays attributable to discovery in most cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-62" href="#post-8648-footnote-62">[61]</a></sup></p>

<p><a id="post-8648-_Toc78313080"></a> The notion that there is a dearth of appellate guidance when it comes to discovery in civil litigation is widespread both throughout the Judiciary and the academy.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553622"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-63" href="#post-8648-footnote-63">[62]</a></sup> The Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged that it has “generally denied review of pretrial discovery orders.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-64" href="#post-8648-footnote-64">[63]</a></sup> Of course, nobody claims that appellate courts <em>never</em> address discovery issues.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552354"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-65" href="#post-8648-footnote-65">[64]</a></sup> Several long-standing exceptions to the procedural hurdles to review are described below in subpart I(C). But the proportion of appellate decisions on civil discovery is significantly smaller than the number of trial-level orders.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-66" href="#post-8648-footnote-66">[65]</a></sup> This difference is particularly pronounced when contrasting the trial-level judges who spend, at minimum, five to ten percent of their time on discovery issues with the Roberts Court, which has heard six discovery cases in fifteen years.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-8648-footnote-67">[66]</a></sup> And the absence of appellate guidance flows from several procedural barriers.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-68" href="#post-8648-footnote-68">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>The procedural barriers that limit discovery appeals have been well covered in the prior literature.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553726"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-69" href="#post-8648-footnote-69">[68]</a></sup> Most dauntingly, a trial-level court’s discovery order is rarely a final order that may be immediately appealed under section 1291 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-70" href="#post-8648-footnote-70">[69]</a></sup> No matter what the issue, while a party can seek review of an interlocutory order, the process is criticized for being too complex, underused by judges, and unpredictable.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-8648-footnote-71">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to the complexity of interlocutory appeals generally, some of the mechanisms apply only in certain contexts, while others can be used in a broader array of cases. For example, as part of a common-law doctrine, the Supreme Court specifically allows interlocutory appeals of denials of summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-72" href="#post-8648-footnote-72">[71]</a></sup> On the other hand, district courts may certify any otherwise unappealable interlocutory orders in civil cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-73" href="#post-8648-footnote-73">[72]</a></sup> Further illustrating the complexity of interlocutory appeals, the aforementioned pair of exceptions spring from different sources—the former is a product of a judge-made doctrine, while the latter is a congressionally enacted statute.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-74" href="#post-8648-footnote-74">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interlocutory appeals also are sparingly granted.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-75" href="#post-8648-footnote-75">[74]</a></sup> As the Fifth Circuit opined, “[i]nterlocutory appeals are generally disfavored, and statutes permitting them must be strictly construed.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-76" href="#post-8648-footnote-76">[75]</a></sup> Accordingly, courts have observed that they reserve interlocutory appeals for exceptional, big cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-77" href="#post-8648-footnote-77">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>The third commonly recognized problem with the system of interlocutory appeals is that the governing doctrine is unpredictable.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-78" href="#post-8648-footnote-78">[77]</a></sup> For example, as Bryan Lammon has extensively covered, the collateral-order doctrine is beset by vague terms and inconsistent application at both the trial and appellate levels.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-79" href="#post-8648-footnote-79">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>Courts gainsay these problems, suggesting that the ultimate right of an appeal from a final judgment ensures that any significant discovery issue can be remedied.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-80" href="#post-8648-footnote-80">[79]</a></sup> In <em>Mohawk</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-81" href="#post-8648-footnote-81">[80]</a></sup> the Supreme Court explicitly noted that the theoretical availability of “[s]ection 1292(b) appeals, mandamus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate immediate review of some of the more consequential attorney–client privilege rulings.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-8648-footnote-82">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in addition to the categorical issues with interlocutory appeals, discovery orders rarely present controlling questions of law that warrant appellate review as required by § 1292(b).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-83" href="#post-8648-footnote-83">[82]</a></sup> Instead, it is well established that discovery orders tend to evaluate fact-specific questions over the applications of the discovery rules in the particular cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-84" href="#post-8648-footnote-84">[83]</a></sup> For example, in assessing a motion to compel the production of confidential documents, a court might evaluate the particular probative value of the documents and weigh it against the case-specific risks of disclosure.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-85" href="#post-8648-footnote-85">[84]</a></sup> On the other hand, few discovery orders turn purely on questions of law. Illustrating one such rare instance, the Fifth Circuit heard an appeal from a discovery order to address whether Mississippi state law would extend the attorney–client privilege to circumstances involving the commission of a tort.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-86" href="#post-8648-footnote-86">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, discovery orders usually are not characterized as final orders because they do not formally dispose of claims or defenses other than in the rare case of a dismissal as a sanction for discovery violations.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-87" href="#post-8648-footnote-87">[86]</a></sup> This approach is common even if the discovery orders might tilt the chances of success by excluding or permitting certain evidence.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-88" href="#post-8648-footnote-88">[87]</a></sup> For example, a magistrate judge prohibited a plaintiff from offering expert testimony on whether the plaintiff’s losses were caused by flood or by wind where only the latter was covered by the insurance policy.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-89" href="#post-8648-footnote-89">[88]</a></sup> The district court held that the order was not dispositive even though the plaintiff could not prevail without her expert’s testimony.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-90" href="#post-8648-footnote-90">[89]</a></sup> Nevertheless, not all courts view such orders as non-dispositive. In another illustrative case, a different district court held that a similar order excluding expert testimony “vitiate[d] plaintiff’s case” and was “tantamount to an involuntary dismissal.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-91" href="#post-8648-footnote-91">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>The practical unavailability of immediate appeal leads to limited incentives to challenge perceived errors later.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-92" href="#post-8648-footnote-92">[91]</a></sup> A primary aspect of the limited incentives is how the aggrieved party might win or settle the case below, mooting the issue.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-93" href="#post-8648-footnote-93">[92]</a></sup> In a world in which ninety percent or more of civil cases settle, the potential pool of discovery appeals is very limited.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-94" href="#post-8648-footnote-94">[93]</a></sup> And, even if the issue is not mooted and it finds its way before a reviewing court, discovery appeals are only rarely granted.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-95" href="#post-8648-footnote-95">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p>The low expected value of an appeal follows from the deferential standard of review.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-96" href="#post-8648-footnote-96">[95]</a></sup> Appellate courts will only reverse a trial-court decision if the trial court abused its discretion in ordering or prohibiting discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-97" href="#post-8648-footnote-97">[96]</a></sup> A trial court abuses its discretion when it makes a clearly erroneous finding of fact or mistake of law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-98" href="#post-8648-footnote-98">[97]</a></sup> Additionally, appellate courts will not reverse a discovery ruling if it was a harmless error.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-99" href="#post-8648-footnote-99">[98]</a></sup> Capturing the prevailing approach of the appellate courts, the First Circuit noted, “Discovery decisions by the bankruptcy judge or district court are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and the discretion in this area is very broad, recognizing that an appeals court simply cannot manage the intricate process of discovery from a distance.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-100" href="#post-8648-footnote-100">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each of these barriers can reinforce the others. The low chances of reversal and the costs of appeal contribute to limited incentives for litigants to challenge discovery orders.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-101" href="#post-8648-footnote-101">[100]</a></sup> This, in turn, means that there are fewer appellate decisions that might encourage appeal.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-102" href="#post-8648-footnote-102">[101]</a></sup> Illustrating this dynamic, a district judge rejected a challenge to a magistrate judge’s waiver decision because the Ninth Circuit had not yet addressed the issue and, thus, the order was not “contrary to law.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-103" href="#post-8648-footnote-103">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>C. Exceptions &amp; Mitigating Approaches to the Absence of Discovery Appeals</h3>
<p>An important caveat about the story of the vertical vacuum is that it has always been less applicable to discovery issues that have their roots in the common law such as the scope of the attorney–client privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-104" href="#post-8648-footnote-104">[103]</a></sup> And there is a fairly developed literature that explores how to get around the barriers to appellate review through procedural mechanisms such as mandamus, policy proposals encouraging greater use of certification, and gaming strategies such as refusing to comply with a discovery order to then challenge an ensuing contempt order.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-105" href="#post-8648-footnote-105">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>Trial-level courts and lawyers also might have cobbled together some partial solutions to the lack of appellate guidance on discovery. Lower courts look to their peer courts for guidance on discovery because that is all they have.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-106" href="#post-8648-footnote-106">[105]</a></sup> And this horizontal precedent works because it frequently develops in a manner that is consonant with—and perhaps informally supported by—the prevailing litigation culture in a district.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-107" href="#post-8648-footnote-107">[106]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761991"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499978"></a> II. Costs &amp; Benefits of the Lack of Formal Appellate Guidance</h2>
<p>This Part describes how the discovery–appeals gap is a conscious design choice of the system. It then explains how the lack of appellate review may limit the possibility of error correction and hinder the development of a vibrant jurisprudence. Throughout, the Part ties the scholarly accounts of the institutional competence of trial- and appellate-level courts to the visions articulated by the courts themselves in their orders.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761992"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499979"></a> A. Explaining the Purposeful Design</h3>
<p>The vertical vacuum is not an unintended consequence of our system. Instead, the absence of appellate decisions on discovery is a deliberate choice of system design. The scholarly literature and the words of judges themselves within discovery orders have primarily identified two rationales for the obstacles that lead to the absence of appellate guidance: judicial efficiency and protecting the discretion of the trial-level judge.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-108" href="#post-8648-footnote-108">[107]</a></sup> Together, these two rationales can best be understood as maximizing the institutional expertise of judges at different levels.</p>
<p>Roadblocks to appealing discovery decisions contribute to judicial efficiency by protecting the time of the appellate courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-109" href="#post-8648-footnote-109">[108]</a></sup> The Supreme Court has cautioned courts to “think carefully before expending ‘scarce judicial resources’ to resolve . . . questions . . . that will ‘have no effect on the outcome of the case.’”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-110" href="#post-8648-footnote-110">[109]</a></sup> As described above, discovery appeals are unlikely to succeed, making appellate review “an essentially academic exercise” for which courts of appeal are “understandably unenthusiastic.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-111" href="#post-8648-footnote-111">[110]</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, the appellate courts’ reluctance to hear live discovery disputes ensures that they are not overly burdened with “appeals of housekeeping matters in the district courts.”<a id="post-8648-_Hlk78465863"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-112" href="#post-8648-footnote-112">[111]</a></sup> The Supreme Court explicitly articulated this rationale, explaining that appellate courts “should not expend their limited resources making determinations that can profitably be made only at the trial level.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-113" href="#post-8648-footnote-113">[112]</a></sup> Instead, the appellate courts are understood as being best positioned to use their scarce time on questions of law requiring consideration of legal concepts and the exercise of judgment about the values underlying the legal principles.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-114" href="#post-8648-footnote-114">[113]</a></sup></p>
<p>The notion that discovery issues are beneath the notice of appellate courts might also turn on the view—shared, fairly or not, by judges at virtually all levels—that many of the disputes arise from the lawyers’ obstreperousness.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-115" href="#post-8648-footnote-115">[114]</a></sup> Illustrating this belief, a federal judge from Florida noted that, in her three decades of litigation experience, the great majority of discovery disputes arose from variations on a lack of professionalism and courtesy.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-116" href="#post-8648-footnote-116">[115]</a></sup> Even accounts that disclaim the general pervasiveness of meritless discovery disputes borne of lawyers’ pique tend to acknowledge that fights over discovery can “become contagious” and sometimes resemble schoolyard fights.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-117" href="#post-8648-footnote-117">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>The absence of appellate case law also logically reduces the potential of nuisance appeals and the drag they may place on either the expeditious resolution of specific cases by prolonging the litigation or on cases in the aggregate by taking up the time of the reviewing courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-118" href="#post-8648-footnote-118">[117]</a></sup> These concerns are also shared by the Legislature, which echoed them in the Senate report on § 1292(b).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-119" href="#post-8648-footnote-119">[118]</a></sup> Moreover, as the Supreme Court noted, litigants have already “concentrate[d] their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account . . . is the correct one.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-120" href="#post-8648-footnote-120">[119]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Supreme Court explained that the impediments to immediately appealing discovery decisions prevent the encroachment “upon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a ‘special role’ in managing ongoing litigation.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-121" href="#post-8648-footnote-121">[120]</a></sup> One benefit of this funneling is related to judicial efficiency—the absence of formal appellate oversight provides enhanced flexibility of the trial court to tailor its decisions to the facts before it.</p>
<p>Richard Heppner has discussed how appealability “implicates the policy debate between the values of systemic efficiency and individual fairness.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-122" href="#post-8648-footnote-122">[121]</a></sup> By restricting the practical appealability of discovery orders, the appellate courts are weighing the “individual fairness” arm of the scale, which is consistent with the consensus that discovery issues usually present case-specific questions.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-123" href="#post-8648-footnote-123">[122]</a></sup> To concretely illustrate this, a study of stipulated protective orders found that trial courts routinely entered orders that did not comply with the governing appellate case law.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111553054"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-124" href="#post-8648-footnote-124">[123]</a></sup> At the same time, this practice appeared to be an effective case-management technique because it reduced disputes and did not create any harm given the lack of court filings.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-125" href="#post-8648-footnote-125">[124]</a></sup> More generally, many trial-level judges have adopted chamber rules that set forth informal procedures for expeditiously addressing discovery disputes.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552856"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-126" href="#post-8648-footnote-126">[125]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another benefit of the rarity of appellate oversight is the enhancement of the trial-level judge’s authority. Charles Black’s daughter recounted a story of turning to her father after her mother said “no” to a request for a third piece of cake.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-127" href="#post-8648-footnote-127">[126]</a></sup> Before she could begin her plea, he shook his head and said, “Baby, I am not a court of appeals.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-128" href="#post-8648-footnote-128">[127]</a></sup> Whether the child of famous legal minds or not, this experience might have broad resonance.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-129" href="#post-8648-footnote-129">[128]</a></sup> And it applies to judges too. As the Supreme Court observed, “[T]he district judge can better exercise [his or her] responsibility [to oversee the prejudgment tactics of litigants] if the appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment rulings.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-130" href="#post-8648-footnote-130">[129]</a></sup></p>
<p>This concern about buttressing the authority of the trial-level judges might apply with special force to matters before magistrate judges whose discovery rulings may be appealed to district judges as a matter of course. In a <em>qui tam</em> case, one district judge noted that the parties constantly challenged the magistrate judge’s discovery orders simply “to provide their client with a second bite at the juridical apple” and not because they thought the decisions were wrong.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-131" href="#post-8648-footnote-131">[130]</a></sup></p>
<p>The primacy of trial-level judges also may reflect the institutional competency of district and magistrate judges. It is likely that trial-level judges have greater expertise in managing discovery disputes than do their appellate-level counterparts, especially as contrasted with members of the Supreme Court.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111559065"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-132" href="#post-8648-footnote-132">[131]</a></sup> In dissent, Justice Stevens once criticized the Court for reviewing de novo factual findings because the Justices in the majority “did not hear the witness testify; they have insufficient time to study the transcript with the care that is appropriate to credibility determinations; and, indeed, collectively they have only minimal experience in the factfinding profession.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-133" href="#post-8648-footnote-133">[132]</a></sup> And this remains the case today—only Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Gorsuch have about ten or more years of civil litigation experience, and it was decades ago for all of them.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-134" href="#post-8648-footnote-134">[133]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other side, trial-level judges will likely have expertise in handling discovery disputes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-135" href="#post-8648-footnote-135">[134]</a></sup> In part, these judges have greater experience handling the sorts of fact-specific calls that arise in the context of discovery disputes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-136" href="#post-8648-footnote-136">[135]</a></sup> Also, trial-level judges address many more discovery disputes and thus are more familiar with the substance of the law and the practical ramifications of its application to specific cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-137" href="#post-8648-footnote-137">[136]</a></sup> While still on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Justice Gorsuch identified this comparative advantage of trial-level judges, writing:</p>
<p>Discovery disputes are, for better or worse, the daily bread of magistrate and district judges in the age of the disappearing trial. Our district court colleagues live and breathe these problems; they have a strong situation sense about what is and isn’t acceptable conduct; by contrast, we encounter these issues rarely and then only from a distance.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-138" href="#post-8648-footnote-138">[137]</a></sup></p>
<p>And, in their written orders, district judges frequently reference their experience and expertise when deciding discovery issues. For example, there has been a trend towards informal dispute-resolution methods, such as permitting telephonic conferences, instead of formal motion hearings over discovery disputes based on the judges’ positive experiences with the techniques.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-139" href="#post-8648-footnote-139">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>For better or worse, judges even rely on their experience and assumed expertise when making case-specific rulings. In some cases, the judges properly compare or contrast a specific litigant’s behavior with the norms in that jurisdiction. For example, a district judge relied, in part, on “the Court’s own experience with similar discovery disputes” in finding that the requested hours in a fee application related to a discovery dispute were excessive.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-140" href="#post-8648-footnote-140">[139]</a></sup> Similarly, in another fee dispute related to discovery abuses, a district court noted that “the degree of misfeasance and lack of candor exhibited by the City and its counsel in the course of this discovery dispute were simply unprecedented” and thus justified a sizeable free award.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-141" href="#post-8648-footnote-141">[140]</a></sup> In other cases, judges rely on their experience to make generalizations about the merits of certain types of discovery requests that seem, at minimum, facially troubling. For example, in a civil rights case brought by a prisoner in New York, the district judge relied on his general experience with similar cases to frame the likely probative value and burdens of the requested discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-142" href="#post-8648-footnote-142">[141]</a></sup></p>
<p>Notwithstanding that prior troubling example, the assumed substantive expertise of trial-level judges should again apply even more strongly when considering magistrate judges specifically. As discussed in further detail below, magistrate judges are the frontline discovery managers in the federal courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-143" href="#post-8648-footnote-143">[142]</a></sup> And both scholars and the courts themselves have recognized the magistrate judges’ expertise in the area of discovery.</p>
<p>Diego Zambrano’s study of magistrate and district judges confirms the link between expertise and familiarity with discovery issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-144" href="#post-8648-footnote-144">[143]</a></sup> He found that magistrate judges made the fewest errors in applying new discovery standards following the 2015 amendments to Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-145" href="#post-8648-footnote-145">[144]</a></sup></p>
<p>Courts also recognize magistrate judges’ command of the law of discovery. For example, one district judge commented, “By reason of their vast experience in handling such matters, magistrate judges are as competent as the district judges (if not more competent) to preside over discovery disputes.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-146" href="#post-8648-footnote-146">[145]</a></sup> In addition to their handling of discovery matters, magistrate judges often have developed a talent for facilitating settlement negotiations from their experience acting as mediators—a skill set that can help informally resolve discovery disputes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-147" href="#post-8648-footnote-147">[146]</a></sup> District judges have even recognized the expertise of specific magistrate judges who have blazed the trails on discovery issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-148" href="#post-8648-footnote-148">[147]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to having more experience with discovery cases generally, trial-level judges likely know more about the specifics of the case in which a particular discovery dispute arises. For example, in addressing a dispute over fees, the district judge noted that it found no evidence of duplicate billing “given its own experience with this complicated discovery dispute.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-149" href="#post-8648-footnote-149">[148]</a></sup> In the same vein, another district judge rejected a party’s attempt to designate a broad swathe of transcripts as confidential based on the judge’s “unfortunate experience of reading transcripts of many depositions in this case.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-150" href="#post-8648-footnote-150">[149]</a></sup> One final example highlights how district judges can wisely apply their discovery expertise at both the category and case levels. A district judge had developed informal processes for addressing discovery disputes that helped expedite the resolution of most issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-151" href="#post-8648-footnote-151">[150]</a></sup> But, when faced with litigants who struggled with that system, the district judge required formal briefing.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-152" href="#post-8648-footnote-152">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, as the frontline managers of discovery, magistrate judges will have this same understanding of the case context in which discovery disputes arise. For example, in a set of antitrust cases, the magistrate judge issued at least eighteen orders resolving twenty-five or more discovery disputes over a multiyear period.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-153" href="#post-8648-footnote-153">[152]</a></sup> Further illustrating these dynamics, in another case, a magistrate judge relied on her experiences with the parties’ discovery disputes to determine that the plaintiff acted diligently as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-154" href="#post-8648-footnote-154">[153]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc94728162"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761993"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499980"></a> B. Identifying the Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The absence of formal appellate guidance on discovery issues is a deliberate design choice—and one that carries real costs. Commentators have identified that robust error correction and the development of uniform law are inhibited by the absence of appellate review.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111555652"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-155" href="#post-8648-footnote-155">[154]</a></sup> Moreover, servicing these two aims adds to the fairness and legitimacy of the legal process.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554502"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-156" href="#post-8648-footnote-156">[155]</a></sup></p>
<p>The benefit of error correction should be relatively self-apparent—courts of appeal provide litigants with an opportunity to show that the lower court erred so that the final legal judgment correctly applies the law to the facts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-157" href="#post-8648-footnote-157">[156]</a></sup> This is their basic function.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-158" href="#post-8648-footnote-158">[157]</a></sup></p>
<p>The magnitude of the underlying problem in this specific context—that is, the extent to which trial-level judges err in their discovery orders—is difficult to estimate. The procedural barriers to appeal mean that we should not expect to see many instances in which orders are reversed, and the fact-bound nature of many discovery issues explains why the rare appeal is unlikely to generate an easily found published opinion.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111555095"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-159" href="#post-8648-footnote-159">[158]</a></sup> Even if an intrepid researcher were to search docket entries directly, many courts use informal processes to resolve discovery disputes, and thus, the record is likely to underreport issues.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111552598"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-160" href="#post-8648-footnote-160">[159]</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, the tendency to assume that trial-level discovery orders might frequently contain mistakes intuitively follows from the structural design of the system.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-161" href="#post-8648-footnote-161">[160]</a></sup> Discovery orders rarely involve issues that will have a broad legal effect, reducing the incentives for judges to devote significant time and attention to them.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-162" href="#post-8648-footnote-162">[161]</a></sup> Additionally, the risk of reversal is very low given the deferential standard of review and the lack of appeals, which also reduces the incentives for judges to ensure that their discovery orders are without error.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-163" href="#post-8648-footnote-163">[162]</a></sup> It also is plausible that both litigants and judges view resolving discovery disputes expeditiously as more important than getting them technically right.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-164" href="#post-8648-footnote-164">[163]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the incentive structure that suggests we can expect to frequently find mistakes in discovery orders (even with the barriers to appeal), descriptively, there <em>are</em> many examples in which trial-level courts have made mistakes in discovery orders to the potential significant detriment of a party.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-165" href="#post-8648-footnote-165">[164]</a></sup> For example, in an employment discrimination case, a judge mistakenly permitted discovery into the plaintiff’s immigration status despite its lack of immediate relevance, the potential chilling effects on the bringing of such civil rights suits, and its inconsistency with the governing case law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-166" href="#post-8648-footnote-166">[165]</a></sup></p>
<p>A lack of appellate review can hinder the development of rigorous and uniform law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-167" href="#post-8648-footnote-167">[166]</a></sup> District courts are generally charged to simply handle the cases before them without necessarily considering the broader impacts of their decisions.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-168" href="#post-8648-footnote-168">[167]</a></sup> The district courts cannot be faulted for this because they often face significant docket pressures and may not be exposed to a variety of representative fact patterns.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-169" href="#post-8648-footnote-169">[168]</a></sup> But the end result can be muddled case law that fails to provide guidance to litigants.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-170" href="#post-8648-footnote-170">[169]</a></sup></p>
<p>Collected below for the first time, there are a handful of both current and older instances in which the absence of appellate review led to inconsistent tests for discovery issues, sometimes even within the same district.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-171" href="#post-8648-footnote-171">[170]</a></sup> In considering the scope of the problem, given the paucity of reported discovery orders and appeals, intra-district and intra-circuit divergence might be endemic, leading to heightened uncertainty for litigants.</p>
<p>In 2019, a district court in Nevada noted an intra-circuit split over whether discovery should be stayed while a dispositive pre-answer motion is pending.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111539231"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-172" href="#post-8648-footnote-172">[171]</a></sup> As early as 1995, some district courts within the Ninth Circuit applied a multi-factor test to determine if discovery should be stayed in such circumstances.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-173" href="#post-8648-footnote-173">[172]</a></sup> But other courts only stay discovery if there is an immediate and clear possibility that the motion will be granted.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-174" href="#post-8648-footnote-174">[173]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2015, a district court in Ohio highlighted the lack of intra-circuit consistency as to when plaintiffs were entitled to discovery into the defendants’ potential bias in ERISA cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-175" href="#post-8648-footnote-175">[174]</a></sup> Some courts permitted such discovery based on the plaintiff’s allegation of a conflict of interest alone while others required more.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-176" href="#post-8648-footnote-176">[175]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jonathan Remy Nash and Joanna Shepherd identified a third intra-district split—this one on the meaning of the 2006 amendment to Rule 26(b)(2).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-177" href="#post-8648-footnote-177">[176]</a></sup> The amended language provides that “[a] party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-178" href="#post-8648-footnote-178">[177]</a></sup> Some courts took the view that the amendment prohibited any discovery of electronically stored information that was not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost, evaluating this question under the preexisting seven-factor <em>Zubulake</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-179" href="#post-8648-footnote-179">[178]</a></sup> test.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-180" href="#post-8648-footnote-180">[179]</a></sup> Within Kansas, another faction of federal courts used the factors in the Advisory Committee notes to determine whether to permit the discovery or shift costs.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-181" href="#post-8648-footnote-181">[180]</a></sup> A second group of federal courts within Kansas considered both sets of factors.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-182" href="#post-8648-footnote-182">[181]</a></sup></p>
<p>A fourth intra-circuit split involved the discovery of federal income tax returns within the Eleventh Circuit.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-183" href="#post-8648-footnote-183">[182]</a></sup> Some courts applied a heightened approach based on a public policy against their disclosure while others used the standard relevancy test.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-184" href="#post-8648-footnote-184">[183]</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, district courts within the Seventh Circuit differed on whether the inadvertent disclosure of privileged information waived privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-185" href="#post-8648-footnote-185">[184]</a></sup> Within the Northern District of Illinois itself, there were three separate approaches, ranging from finding waiver from nearly any disclosure to holding that unintentional waiver never waives the privilege.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111555934"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-186" href="#post-8648-footnote-186">[185]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether disclosure of attorney work product in connection with a government investigation waives the privilege in later civil discovery also was the subject of an intra-district split in the Second Circuit for many years.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-187" href="#post-8648-footnote-187">[186]</a></sup> Some courts within the circuit found that disclosure to the government did not waive the privilege because the disclosure to a regulator did not increase the adversary’s opportunities to obtain the material while others found that voluntary production constituted waiver of the privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-188" href="#post-8648-footnote-188">[187]</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking forward, it is possible that inconsistent case law might develop around other discovery issues—a risk that is especially high after a core aspect of discovery doctrine was recently unsettled. Specifically, a 2015 amendment to Rule 26(b)(1) added a proportionality requirement to the definition of the scope of discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-189" href="#post-8648-footnote-189">[188]</a></sup> This definition includes several difficult-to-measure objectives.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-190" href="#post-8648-footnote-190">[189]</a></sup> This standard has been criticized as too vague and as requiring information—such as how individual judges’ practices might vary—that neither the parties nor the judges might have.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111555023"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-191" href="#post-8648-footnote-191">[190]</a></sup> These same issues might make it difficult for trial-level judges to create a uniform scheme.</p>
<p>The lack of uniform law might be self-perpetuating based on the incentives for the litigants too. The absence of active oversight permits district courts to be less-than-faithful stewards of appellate-level jurisprudence.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-192" href="#post-8648-footnote-192">[191]</a></sup> And then, when faced with varying district court practices and limited appellate oversight, parties might choose to settle and thus reduce the likelihood that an appellate court addresses the issue.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-193" href="#post-8648-footnote-193">[192]</a></sup></p>
<p>These practical disadvantages, stemming from the lack of appellate decisions on discovery, carry meaningful normative costs.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-194" href="#post-8648-footnote-194">[193]</a></sup> Accuracy is a fundamental component of fairness.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-195" href="#post-8648-footnote-195">[194]</a></sup> And this principle should be served by having a multi-judge panel assess a decision made by a sole, frontline jurist, especially if the panel catches errors or develops more rigorous frameworks to evaluate discovery disputes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-196" href="#post-8648-footnote-196">[195]</a></sup> Moreover, appellate review should reassure litigants of the fairness and legitimacy of the process by both articulating the rationales underlying the decisions and ensuring that the allocation of rights and duties does not turn simply on the caprice of an individual judge.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-197" href="#post-8648-footnote-197">[196]</a></sup></p>

<p>This Part explores the Roberts Court’s pronouncements on discovery, canvassing both formal and informal statements. It first examines the only six cases in which the Court heard appeals to actual discovery decisions—a sextet whose analysis and holdings, counterintuitively, have more significance in non-discovery cases. With that underbrush cleared, the Article turns to its namesake concern: the effect that background concerns about the timing and expense of discovery have on the Court’s non-discovery jurisprudence. The Part concludes by describing another high-profile set of Chief Justice Roberts’s discovery dicta: his 2016 and 2015 Year-End Reports.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc81579389"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc81639238"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc94372636"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc94728167"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761995"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499982"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc78313093"></a> A. Discovery Merits Cases</h3>
<p>Appeals of discovery decisions rarely make their way to the Supreme Court.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-198" href="#post-8648-footnote-198">[197]</a></sup> In the Roberts era, only six discovery merits appeals have reached the Court.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-199" href="#post-8648-footnote-199">[198]</a></sup> In each of these cases, the Court’s analysis went beyond the mechanics of discovery, reaching other significant legal questions. Given the high bar for granting a writ of certiorari, which includes the proviso that review should be limited to “important federal question[s],” the complexity of the cases should not be surprising.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-200" href="#post-8648-footnote-200">[199]</a></sup> But the breadth of the holdings and other clues—e.g., the reasons for granting certiorari, the authorities relied on, and the use by subsequent lower courts—suggest that this sextet of cases mostly are not even true <em>discovery</em> discovery cases.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Court issued its two most recent discovery merits decisions, which both address questions about 28 U.S.C. § 1782.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-201" href="#post-8648-footnote-201">[200]</a></sup> In <em>ZF Auto</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-202" href="#post-8648-footnote-202">[201]</a></sup> a sales contract called for any disputes to be submitted to a specific private dispute-resolution organization in Germany.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-203" href="#post-8648-footnote-203">[202]</a></sup> The Hong Kong-based buyer sought information from the Michigan-based seller under § 1782, which authorizes federal district courts to order testimony or the production of evidence “for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-204" href="#post-8648-footnote-204">[203]</a></sup> The seller moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing that the term “foreign or international tribunal” did not cover a private arbitral body. The Court agreed with the seller based on dictionary definitions of the terms, the statute’s nod to government procedures in other sections, and the statute’s focus on comity. In <em>Zubaydah</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-205" href="#post-8648-footnote-205">[204]</a></sup> a foreign national attempted to use § 1782 to obtain information about contractors for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for use in a Polish criminal investigation as to whether the contractors had tortured the foreign national.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-206" href="#post-8648-footnote-206">[205]</a></sup> The United States intervened and sought to prevent the discovery, asserting state secrets privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-207" href="#post-8648-footnote-207">[206]</a></sup> The Court held that the state secrets privilege applied to bar the discovery where the confirmation or denial of Poland as a CIA interrogation location could harm national security and the requesting party suggested that his need for the information was not great.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-208" href="#post-8648-footnote-208">[207]</a></sup></p>
<p>While both <em>ZF Auto </em>and <em>Zubaydah</em> directly address discovery issues, there is, at minimum, some suggestion that the trial courts’ day-to-day case management was not what drove the grants of certiorari. First, by its nature, § 1782 is designed to aid parties in foreign litigation, not those suing in domestic courts. Also, in <em>ZF Auto</em>, the Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split. As Amanda Frost has noted, the Roberts Court appears to honor uniformity, even on minor issues, as a key criterion for granting certiorari.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111556272"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-209" href="#post-8648-footnote-209">[208]</a></sup> Additionally, only months removed from their issuance, the effects of <em>ZF Auto</em> and <em>Zubaydah</em> are hard to definitively know. For example, it is possible that the understanding of “tribunal” in <em>ZF Auto </em>will migrate to other statutes, and the state secrets privilege can arise in many evidentiary contexts. To the former, as of June 2022, only one case has cited <em>ZF Auto</em>, straightforwardly applying it to a § 1782 dispute over whether a foreign private arbitral body was encompassed by the term.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-210" href="#post-8648-footnote-210">[209]</a></sup> To the latter, two cases have cited <em>Zubaydah</em>, but neither involved discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-211" href="#post-8648-footnote-211">[210]</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Haeger</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-212" href="#post-8648-footnote-212">[211]</a></sup> another of the few Roberts Court cases that directly addressed a discovery issue, arose from a product-liability suit brought against a tire company after the plaintiffs’ motorhome flipped over.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-213" href="#post-8648-footnote-213">[212]</a></sup> Over several years of litigation, the tire company engaged in bad-faith discovery conduct, including the withholding of a vital safety report related to the allegedly defective tires.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-214" href="#post-8648-footnote-214">[213]</a></sup> The district court sanctioned the tire company under its inherent authority, ordering the tire company to pay $2.7 million to compensate the plaintiffs for all the attorneys’ fees and costs incurred from the first dishonest discovery response.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-215" href="#post-8648-footnote-215">[214]</a></sup> On appeal, the Court addressed whether the district court’s inherent authority permitted it to sanction the tire company for all of the plaintiffs’ expenses, whether or not they could be causally tied to the tire company’s misconduct.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-216" href="#post-8648-footnote-216">[215]</a></sup> As should be expected, the Court did not disturb the district court’s factual determinations or indulge in its own hypothesizing about the underlying facts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-217" href="#post-8648-footnote-217">[216]</a></sup> Instead, the holding focused on the appropriate legal standard as to the “but-for” causation required to support an award of fees under a federal trial court’s inherent powers.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-218" href="#post-8648-footnote-218">[217]</a></sup> The Court held that that the lower courts had erred because a sanctioning court “must determine which fees were incurred because of, and solely because of, the misconduct at issue.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-219" href="#post-8648-footnote-219">[218]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the case grew out of a discovery dispute, several factors suggest that the Court’s main priority was not about helping lower courts manage discovery. First, just as in <em>ZF Auto</em>, the Court noted that it granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-220" href="#post-8648-footnote-220">[219]</a></sup> Further confirming the focus of the Court’s concern, discovery did not play any role in the circuit cases creating the split.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-221" href="#post-8648-footnote-221">[220]</a></sup> Second, of the handful of cases discussed in the Court’s analysis, again, only one involved discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-222" href="#post-8648-footnote-222">[221]</a></sup> Third, the Court’s holding has broad applicability beyond the discovery context and speaks more fundamentally to the power of the federal trial courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-223" href="#post-8648-footnote-223">[222]</a></sup> Fourth, consistent with this reading, subsequent courts do not appear to have relied on <em>Goodyear</em> as a discovery-<em>qua</em>-discovery case. <em>Goodyear</em> has been cited in 644 cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-224" href="#post-8648-footnote-224">[223]</a></sup> Only 130 of these citations pair the reference to <em>Goodyear</em> with a mention of “discovery” in the same paragraph.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-225" href="#post-8648-footnote-225">[224]</a></sup> Most starkly, only eight citing cases are listed under the discovery-focused headnote to the case.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-226" href="#post-8648-footnote-226">[225]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next Roberts Court discovery case, <em>Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-227" href="#post-8648-footnote-227">[226]</a></sup> involved a significant political question of international relations.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-228" href="#post-8648-footnote-228">[227]</a></sup> In the case, the plaintiff sued the Republic of Argentina after it defaulted on its external debt.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-229" href="#post-8648-footnote-229">[228]</a></sup> After prevailing in eleven actions to collect on its debt of $2.5 billion, the plaintiff sought discovery on Argentina’s property in the hopes of enforcing its judgments.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-230" href="#post-8648-footnote-230">[229]</a></sup> The district court permitted discovery directed to Argentina’s banks with locations in New York over the country’s sovereign immunity objections.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-231" href="#post-8648-footnote-231">[230]</a></sup> The Court affirmed, focusing its attention on whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act impliedly prohibited discovery in aid of execution of a judgment against a foreign sovereign’s assets.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-232" href="#post-8648-footnote-232">[231]</a></sup> The Court noted that the Act did not explicitly displace the federal discovery rules in this context and thus held that the district court had discretion to order discovery from third-party banks about the sovereign debtor’s assets located outside the United States.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-233" href="#post-8648-footnote-233">[232]</a></sup></p>
<p>Discovery is a more central legal concern in the <em>Republic of Argentina</em> decision than it is in <em>Goodyear</em>. Of the 219 subsequent cases citing <em>Republic of Argentina</em>, about 67% are listed under the discovery-focused headnotes, which is much more than any of the other cases in this sextet but still not an overwhelming amount.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-234" href="#post-8648-footnote-234">[233]</a></sup> Even so, the Court’s analysis in <em>Republic of Argentina</em> primarily addressed separation-of-powers concerns rather than closely parsing the underlying discovery rules (as took place in the lower courts).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-235" href="#post-8648-footnote-235">[234]</a></sup></p>
<p>The final two Roberts Court decisions on discovery dealt with the attorney–client privilege, which receives more appellate attention given its intersection with evidence and its roots in the common law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-236" href="#post-8648-footnote-236">[235]</a></sup> The first of these cases, <em>United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-237" href="#post-8648-footnote-237">[236]</a></sup> shares some similarities with<em> ZF Automotive </em>and <em>Republic of Argentina</em> in that all three involved the federal government’s relationship with other sovereigns. In <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>, the tribe sued the federal government for mismanaging property held in trust on its behalf.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-238" href="#post-8648-footnote-238">[237]</a></sup> After years of engaging in alternative dispute resolution processes, the tribe moved to compel the government to produce more than one hundred documents withheld under the attorney–client privilege and attorney–work–product doctrine.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-239" href="#post-8648-footnote-239">[238]</a></sup> The lower court partially granted the tribe’s motion to compel, finding that a long-standing fiduciary exception to the attorney–client privilege applied.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-240" href="#post-8648-footnote-240">[239]</a></sup> The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that, even if it were to recognize the exception, the exception did not extend to the federal government in its capacity as trustee of tribal funds.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-241" href="#post-8648-footnote-241">[240]</a></sup></p>
<p>The nature of the trust relationship between the federal government and the tribe is the predominant theme in the <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em> analysis.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111556612"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-242" href="#post-8648-footnote-242">[241]</a></sup> Only one of the five cases discussed most fully by the Court in <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation </em>deals with the fiduciary exception to the attorney–client privilege, while the others primarily concerned the duties owed to tribes by the federal government.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-243" href="#post-8648-footnote-243">[242]</a></sup> In keeping with this theme, <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em> has been most cited for its holding about the relationship between the federal government and tribes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-244" href="#post-8648-footnote-244">[243]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <em>Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter</em>, the Roberts Court addressed whether an order compelling disclosure of material withheld on the basis of attorney–client privilege qualified for immediate appeal under the collateral-order doctrine.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-245" href="#post-8648-footnote-245">[244]</a></sup> Here, like in <em>Republic of Argentina</em>, the discovery issue was intertwined with a broader question of statutory interpretation and implicated separation-of-powers concerns.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-246" href="#post-8648-footnote-246">[245]</a></sup> In <em>Mohawk</em>, Carpenter sued Mohawk for violating 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) and various state laws, alleging that after he informed the company that it was using undocumented immigrants (an allegation in a pending class action, unbeknownst to Carpenter), the company fired him.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-247" href="#post-8648-footnote-247">[246]</a></sup> Carpenter sought information related to his pre-termination meeting with Mohawk’s counsel.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-248" href="#post-8648-footnote-248">[247]</a></sup> Mohawk refused to produce it, asserting that it was protected from disclosure by attorney–client privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-249" href="#post-8648-footnote-249">[248]</a></sup> The district court granted Carpenter’s motion to compel but then stayed its ruling to allow Mohawk to explore an immediate appeal under the collateral-order doctrine.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-250" href="#post-8648-footnote-250">[249]</a></sup> The Court held that orders rejecting assertions of attorney–client privilege did not qualify for immediate review because post-judgment appeals “generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and ensure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-251" href="#post-8648-footnote-251">[250]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the six cases discussed within this subpart,<em> Mohawk</em> is probably the ruling that will be the most applicable to day-to-day discovery practice. Even so, just as in <em>Goodyear</em>, the Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged that it granted review to resolve a circuit split.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-252" href="#post-8648-footnote-252">[251]</a></sup> Moreover, much of the Court’s analysis focused on the relationship between the Judiciary and Congress in setting the statutory subject matter of the courts, not the boundaries of the attorney–client privilege itself.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-253" href="#post-8648-footnote-253">[252]</a></sup> Only two of the seven cases discussed by the <em>Mohawk </em>Court arose out of the discovery context, and only one of those cases involved a motion to compel.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-254" href="#post-8648-footnote-254">[253]</a></sup> The others focused on interlocutory appeals.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-255" href="#post-8648-footnote-255">[254]</a></sup> And, just like <em>Goodyear </em>and <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>, relatively few cases are listed as citing <em>Mohawk </em>under its sole discovery-focused headnote.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-256" href="#post-8648-footnote-256">[255]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761996"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499983"></a> B. The Gravitational Pull of Discovery</h3>
<p>The Roberts Court’s discovery cases are at most only partially discovery cases—a particularly surprising turn given the significant role that the cost-and-delay narrative of discovery has played in the Court’s other jurisprudence. While courts and scholars have commented extensively on its effect on <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal</em>, the full extent of discovery’s gravitational pull has not been explored.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111558539"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-257" href="#post-8648-footnote-257">[256]</a></sup> This Part extends and updates the existing scholarship, collecting all the substantive references to discovery in Supreme Court decisions issued between Chief Justice Roberts’s investiture and the end of the October 2020 term.</p>
<p>References to the cost-and-delay narrative are near ubiquitous in the decisions of the Roberts Court from this period, well beyond the normal intertwinement of the Civil Rules.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-258" href="#post-8648-footnote-258">[257]</a></sup> These references appear across a panoply of substantive and procedural issues, such as pleading, executive privilege, First Amendment challenges, stays, and the reach of certain statutes.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111556833"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-259" href="#post-8648-footnote-259">[258]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Twombly</em> and <em>Iqbal </em>decisions are the prime examples of discovery’s outsized influence with the Roberts Court. They also were the rare cases in which the cost-and-delay narrative’s profile was especially high and garnered a great deal of attention.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554966"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-260" href="#post-8648-footnote-260">[259]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <em>Twombly</em>, the Court held that consumers’ allegations of parallel pricing as violative of the Sherman Act were insufficient to state a claim.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-261" href="#post-8648-footnote-261">[260]</a></sup> Writing for the majority, Justice Souter cautioned courts against “forget[ting] that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive” and cited several cases and other authorities for the proposition that litigation can be bogged down by costs or that it could lead to meritless claims being settled to avoid the nuisance expense.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-262" href="#post-8648-footnote-262">[261]</a></sup> Justice Souter also explicitly rejected the argument that trial-level judges could use discovery-management tools to manage the expense well enough to prevent abuse.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-263" href="#post-8648-footnote-263">[262]</a></sup> On the other hand, Justice Stevens dissented, at least partially because of his confidence in the trial-level judges’ “case-management arsenal,” including multiple discovery tools.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-264" href="#post-8648-footnote-264">[263]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <em>Iqbal</em>, the Court held that the district court’s order denying officials’ motion to dismiss on grounds of qualified immunity was immediately appealable and that the detainee’s complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for unlawful discrimination.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-265" href="#post-8648-footnote-265">[264]</a></sup> Both holdings turned in part on the cost-and-delay narrative. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy noted that one of the main benefits of qualified immunity was avoiding the burdens of litigation, especially potentially costly discovery, and thus, a rejection of qualified immunity was a final decision subject to immediate appeal.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-266" href="#post-8648-footnote-266">[265]</a></sup> In evaluating the sufficiency of the complaint, Justice Kennedy acknowledged that “Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hypertechnical, code-pleading regime of a prior era” but cautioned that it “does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-267" href="#post-8648-footnote-267">[266]</a></sup> And, just like Justice Souter in <em>Twombly</em>, Justice Kennedy rejected the argument that the trial-level courts could use their case-management tools to mitigate against abusive discovery costs.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-268" href="#post-8648-footnote-268">[267]</a></sup> In dissent (but now joined by Justice Souter, who had penned the <em>Twombly</em> majority decision), Justice Breyer expressed his conviction in the trial courts’ ability to manage discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-269" href="#post-8648-footnote-269">[268]</a></sup> Highlighting the importance of this interplay, years later, Justice Scalia explicitly confirmed that discovery was the driving factor behind <em>Iqbal</em>.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-270" href="#post-8648-footnote-270">[269]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cost-and-delay narrative also appears in the Roberts Court’s jurisdiction and venue cases.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-271" href="#post-8648-footnote-271">[270]</a></sup> For example, in <em>Daimler AG v. Bauman</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-272" href="#post-8648-footnote-272">[271]</a></sup> Justice Ginsburg’s majority decision held that a foreign defendant sued by foreign plaintiffs based on events occurring outside of the United States could not be constitutionally subjected to California’s jurisdiction solely on the basis that it did significant business in the state.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-273" href="#post-8648-footnote-273">[272]</a></sup> Justice Sotomayor concurred in the judgment but criticized the majority’s approach because of the likelihood that it would create greater unpredictability and “radically expand[] the scope of jurisdictional discovery.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-274" href="#post-8648-footnote-274">[273]</a></sup> While they differed on the approach’s effects, Justice Ginsburg seemed to agree that expanding jurisdictional discovery would be problematic.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-275" href="#post-8648-footnote-275">[274]</a></sup> Additionally, in <em>Sinochem</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-276" href="#post-8648-footnote-276">[275]</a></sup> a unanimous Court held that the dismissal of a case under the forum non conveniens doctrine was appropriate, in part, because “[d]iscovery concerning personal jurisdiction would have burdened [the defendant] with expense and delay.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-277" href="#post-8648-footnote-277">[276]</a></sup></p>
<p>Securities fraud and antitrust are two other areas in which discovery costs influence the Roberts Court’s jurisprudence.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-278" href="#post-8648-footnote-278">[277]</a></sup> For example, in limiting the reach of § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Justice Kennedy pointed out that a broader reading would run the risk of expansive discovery that could enable plaintiffs to extort settlements.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-279" href="#post-8648-footnote-279">[278]</a></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with its fears that discovery costs could impede the executive function, the cost-and-delay narrative appears in a handful of cases that implicate that interest.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-280" href="#post-8648-footnote-280">[279]</a></sup> Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy identified discovery expenses as part of the rationale for holding that officials and wardens were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to noncitizens’ civil rights conspiracy claims.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-281" href="#post-8648-footnote-281">[280]</a></sup> Justice Breyer dissented, again, based on the availability of discovery-management tools.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-282" href="#post-8648-footnote-282">[281]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Roberts Court has expressed its concern about the costs of discovery in several First Amendment cases too.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-283" href="#post-8648-footnote-283">[282]</a></sup> In one case, the Court suggested that having to divert resources to respond to discovery requests might constitute an injury sufficient to confer Article III standing in a challenge to an Ohio law criminalizing false statements made during a political campaign.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-284" href="#post-8648-footnote-284">[283]</a></sup> In another, the Court determined that an objective standard was appropriate for an as-applied challenge to a campaign finance statute and that it should entail “minimal if any discovery” to prevent “chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-285" href="#post-8648-footnote-285">[284]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court also has referenced the cost-and-delay narrative in its review of decisions to stay litigation.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-286" href="#post-8648-footnote-286">[285]</a></sup> In remanding youth-brought climate-change litigation, the Court directed the district court to assess the burdens of discovery as part of its analysis.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-287" href="#post-8648-footnote-287">[286]</a></sup></p>
<p>Concerns about discovery costs arise in a potpourri of additional cases, including a few significant non-discovery civil procedure decisions.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-288" href="#post-8648-footnote-288">[287]</a></sup> For example, in <em>Epic</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-289" href="#post-8648-footnote-289">[288]</a></sup> the Court identified the difficulty of requiring arbitrators to alter procedures to address class-wide discovery as part of the rationale for holding that the Federal Arbitration Act’s saving clause did not provide a basis for refusing to enforce arbitration agreements waiving collective-action procedures for certain claims.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-290" href="#post-8648-footnote-290">[289]</a></sup> In <em>Sturgell</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-291" href="#post-8648-footnote-291">[290]</a></sup> the Court defended its categorical approach to determining whether a litigant had been virtually represented in an earlier case because of concerns about the cost of discovery that would be necessary if they had used a more fact-specific multifactor balancing test instead.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-292" href="#post-8648-footnote-292">[291]</a></sup></p>
<p>As already seen in the dissents noted above, several members of the Roberts Court occasionally speak approvingly of discovery and trial-level judges’ ability to use discovery-management tools effectively.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-293" href="#post-8648-footnote-293">[292]</a></sup> For example, in dissenting from the Court’s holding that a federal no-fault compensation program preempted any private litigation, Justice Sotomayor noted that “court actions are essential because they provide injured persons with significant procedural tools—including, most importantly, civil discovery—that are not available in administrative proceedings under the compensation program.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-294" href="#post-8648-footnote-294">[293]</a></sup> And, in holding that assignees had Article III standing to bring claims arising from payphone operators’ injuries under the Communications Act, Justice Breyer stated that the trial-level courts’ discovery-management tools would prevent unnecessary costs or delays.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-295" href="#post-8648-footnote-295">[294]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Roberts Court’s references to discovery do not always involve the cost-and-delay narrative. Discovery also shows up—usually as a point of comparison—when the Court discusses questions of specialized procedure or other law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-296" href="#post-8648-footnote-296">[295]</a></sup> Several other cases incidentally refer to discovery, usually as part of the procedural history. For example, some cases involve claims that were dismissed as a discovery sanction.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-297" href="#post-8648-footnote-297">[296]</a></sup></p>

Chief Justice Roberts’ Use of the Bully Pulpit</h3>
<p>References to the “Roberts Court” appear throughout this Article. But this is a difficult notion to pin down.

<p>A particularly salient example involves Chief Justice Warren Burger, who used the soft power of his position to campaign against excessive, costly litigation, perhaps marking the modern beginning of the cost-and-delay narrative.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-301" href="#post-8648-footnote-301">[300]</a></sup> Chief Justice Burger—like Chief Justice Roberts—also used his official power to appoint members of the Advisory Committee on the Civil Rules, leading to formal rules changes.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111557622"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-302" href="#post-8648-footnote-302">[301]</a></sup> But scholars have identified Chief Justice Burger’s use of his informal powers, such as organizing the Pound Conference, as playing a leading role in the greater sea change.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-303" href="#post-8648-footnote-303">[302]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chief Justice Roberts may have helped bring about the much-criticized 2015 amendments to Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure through his appointments to the Advisory Committee.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-304" href="#post-8648-footnote-304">[303]</a></sup> Responding to the cost-and-delay narrative, the amendments integrated a proportionality requirement directly into the definition of the scope of discovery, which potentially augured a more restrictive regime that would be focused on economic efficiency.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-305" href="#post-8648-footnote-305">[304]</a></sup> But, as Adam Steinman has observed, the proportionality requirement did not formally change much about the actual law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-306" href="#post-8648-footnote-306">[305]</a></sup> Instead, the suggestion that the amendments formalized concerns about excess discovery depends on the non-binding statements of Chief Justice Roberts (and others).<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-307" href="#post-8648-footnote-307">[306]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chief Justice Roberts has inveighed against the costs of litigation since his time as a young lawyer in the Reagan Administration.<a id="post-8648-_Ref116806707"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-308" href="#post-8648-footnote-308">[307]</a></sup> And his 2015 and 2016 Year-End Reports on the Federal Judiciary took special aim at the costs of discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-309" href="#post-8648-footnote-309">[308]</a></sup> The 2015 Year-End Report focused on the amendments that went into effect that year.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-310" href="#post-8648-footnote-310">[309]</a></sup> Chief Justice Roberts characterized the changes as addressing the “the most serious impediments to just, speedy, and efficient resolution of civil disputes” in contrast with amendments that only made “modest,” “technical,” and “even persnickety” changes.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-311" href="#post-8648-footnote-311">[310]</a></sup> In aid of this description, Chief Justice Roberts noted the findings of a 2010 symposium on civil litigation held at Duke University, forgoing any mention of how the panel had adopted the cost-and-delay narrative without examining its (lack of) empirical basis or other criticisms.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-312" href="#post-8648-footnote-312">[311]</a></sup> He then asserted that the amendment to Rule 26(b)(1) should “increase[] reliance” on the use of proportionality as a limiting factor to discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-313" href="#post-8648-footnote-313">[312]</a></sup> In the 2016 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Roberts reemphasized the reforms and noted the launching of several pilot programs designed to reduce discovery costs further.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-314" href="#post-8648-footnote-314">[313]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761998"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499985"></a> IV. Correcting for the Lack of Formal Appellate Guidance</h2>
<p>This Article has already pushed back on the common belief that discovery rarely appears in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. But that does not necessarily mean that the discovery dicta serve the same functions as formal appellate guidance. This Part describes how the Roberts Court’s discovery dicta influence trial-level discovery decisions by providing high-level instructions about the normative balancing they must undertake. It also turns to the error correction and law clarification that accompanies the relatively new form of second-level review by the district judges of magistrate judges’ discovery orders.</p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc95761999"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499986"></a> A. Radiating Power of Dark Matter Discovery</h3>
<p>Discovery functions as dark matter in the Roberts Court’s jurisprudence, but its gravitational effect does not end there. The Court’s pronouncements, regardless as to whether they have formal legal effect, carry great weight.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-315" href="#post-8648-footnote-315">[314]</a></sup> Generally, trial-level courts defer to higher courts’ expressed preferences.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-316" href="#post-8648-footnote-316">[315]</a></sup> This might be due to the difficulty in definitively distinguishing dicta from holdings.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-317" href="#post-8648-footnote-317">[316]</a></sup> It also might follow from the hierarchical nature of the Judiciary.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-318" href="#post-8648-footnote-318">[317]</a></sup></p>
<p>As discussed in Part II, one rationale for the judicial hierarchy is that appellate courts—and especially the Supreme Court—are assumed to have the expertise to address the big questions, such as how to balance competing normative values like accuracy, efficiency, and fairness.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-319" href="#post-8648-footnote-319">[318]</a></sup> The Court can allow issues to percolate below so that it can evaluate a broad range of perspectives.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-320" href="#post-8648-footnote-320">[319]</a></sup> The Court also has the time to carefully parse the law and think about the potential ramifications of the tradeoffs.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-321" href="#post-8648-footnote-321">[320]</a></sup> And, with discovery in particular, the Court has a role in developing and approving the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, positioning them almost like an agency in administrative rulemaking.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-322" href="#post-8648-footnote-322">[321]</a></sup> One problem, though, is that most discovery disputes (even if they were more easily appealed) may not cleanly present the normative issues undergirding the jurisprudence because the orders are so tightly bound with the specific facts of the case.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-323" href="#post-8648-footnote-323">[322]</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, both <em>Twombly</em> and <em>Iqbal</em> involved a real back-and-forth amongst the Justices about the risk of discovery abuse and the ability of the trial-level judges to manage it.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-324" href="#post-8648-footnote-324">[323]</a></sup> Moreover, the cases can be understood as applying the <em>Mathews v. Eldridge</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-325" href="#post-8648-footnote-325">[324]</a></sup> balancing test to discovery.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111554996"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-326" href="#post-8648-footnote-326">[325]</a></sup> In procedural due process challenges (and, functionally, in most discovery challenges), courts apply the <em>Mathews </em>test, weighing the private interest that will be affected by the official action, the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest through the existing procedures, and the probable value of additional or alternative procedure.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-327" href="#post-8648-footnote-327">[326]</a></sup> By implicitly requiring balancing the risk of an erroneous dismissal against the cost of discovery, <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal</em> became excellent vehicles for the Court to deliver normative pronouncements that are determining the general law of discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-328" href="#post-8648-footnote-328">[327]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, trial-level courts retain a great deal of discretion in figuring out how the normative pronouncements apply, which shapes the development of the law—again, a feature (not a bug) of our system.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-329" href="#post-8648-footnote-329">[328]</a></sup> And discovery is an area in which both litigants and courts might be willing to trade expeditious resolution over steadfast adherence to process and the black-letter law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-330" href="#post-8648-footnote-330">[329]</a></sup> Accordingly, an important descriptive question is to what extent are trial-level courts picking up what the Supreme Court is putting down.</p>
<p>As this Article identifies for the first time, even the Supreme Court’s discovery dicta and Chief Justice Roberts’s Year-End Reports affect the application of discovery at the trial level, informally fulfilling part of the appellate function of guiding the development of the law. In examining citations to <em>Twombly</em>, <em>Iqbal</em>, and the two Year-End Reports, one sees trial-level courts citing those sources in their analysis of discovery issues. While it is possible that the Supreme Court’s other discovery dicta guides the trial-level courts, the analysis below focuses on <em>Twombly</em>, <em>Iqbal</em>, and the two Year-End Reports because they are the most well-known calls-to-arms regarding discovery.</p>
<p>Searches for cases referencing either <em>Twombly</em> or <em>Iqbal</em> and terms related to their dicta on the time and expense of discovery led to 149 trial-level orders. Forty-two of these decisions were on point, referencing <em>Twombly </em>or <em>Iqbal</em> in the court’s discovery analysis.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-331" href="#post-8648-footnote-331">[330]</a></sup> The cases came from just nineteen of the ninety-four districts, which suggested that some trial-level decisions were being adopted by colleagues within their respective districts or circuits.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-332" href="#post-8648-footnote-332">[331]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to substance, only seven of the decisions resolved disputes about the scope of discovery with a discussion of relevancy limitations.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-333" href="#post-8648-footnote-333">[332]</a></sup> For example, in <em>Sirazi v. Panda Express, Inc.</em>,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-334" href="#post-8648-footnote-334">[333]</a></sup> Judge Cole of the Northern District of Illinois denied a motion to compel two non-party law firms to produce any communications with one of the litigants based on the involved burden and with a nod to <em>Twombly</em>.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-335" href="#post-8648-footnote-335">[334]</a></sup> Similarly, Judge Browning of the District of New Mexico referenced both <em>Twombly</em> and <em>Iqbal</em> in disallowing burdensome non-party discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-336" href="#post-8648-footnote-336">[335]</a></sup></p>
<p>The remaining thirty-four decisions all involve discovery stays. Litigants often argue that <em>Twombly</em> and <em>Iqbal</em> require staying discovery once a dispositive motion has been filed.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-337" href="#post-8648-footnote-337">[336]</a></sup> And courts analyze those arguments, focusing on how <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal</em> formally decided motions to dismiss and did not have any directly on-point language that would require an automatic stay.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-338" href="#post-8648-footnote-338">[337]</a></sup> And, with this flexibility, several of the courts then granted the stays.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-339" href="#post-8648-footnote-339">[338]</a></sup> A handful of courts recognized that <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal</em> only offered dicta as to stays but still found them weighty. For example, one decision noted that the statements from the cases “indicate very clearly that the Supreme Court believes discovery should be stayed in the case as a whole even when only one defendant is asserting qualified immunity.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-340" href="#post-8648-footnote-340">[339]</a></sup></p>
<p>Given the exceptional nature of the discovery merits cases that get to the Supreme Court, it is even possible that the dicta might have more impact on how trial-level judges manage day-to-day discovery disputes than the holdings in the actual discovery cases. Certainly, it is interesting—if not easily explainable—that the Roberts Court has not generally discussed the big normative tradeoffs of discovery or invoked the cost-and-delay narrative in its actual discovery merits cases. Consider that, of the sextet of cases discussed in subpart III(A), only half of the cases restricted discovery—and all three involved special cases. In <em>ZF Auto</em> and <em>Zubaydah</em>, the Court addressed discovery to aid foreign proceedings under § 1782.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-341" href="#post-8648-footnote-341">[340]</a></sup> In <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>, the Court’s holding only applies to the federal–tribal relationship.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-342" href="#post-8648-footnote-342">[341]</a></sup> Least predictably, in <em>Goodyear</em>, the Court limited the power of the trial courts to sanction parties for discovery abuses and thus implicitly adds to the likelihood of such malfeasance, potentially leading to either more or less discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-343" href="#post-8648-footnote-343">[342]</a></sup> And then, in <em>Republic of Argentina</em>, the Court’s interpretation of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 permitted liberal discovery.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-344" href="#post-8648-footnote-344">[343]</a></sup> In <em>Mohawk</em>, the Court’s ruling made it harder to withhold documents on the basis of attorney–client privilege by reducing the availability of immediate appeals to orders directing the disclosure of such material.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-345" href="#post-8648-footnote-345">[344]</a></sup></p>
<p>Discovery dicta is not the only outlet for the Court to flex its soft authority and provide guidance to the trial-level courts on how to weigh procedural values like accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. In the 2015 and 2016 Year-End Reports, Chief Justice Roberts engaged in explicit advocacy, exhorting courts to apply the amended Rule 26(b)(1)’s definition of scope to limit discovery expenses beyond what the text of the adopted rule would seem to warrant.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111559305"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-346" href="#post-8648-footnote-346">[345]</a></sup> Trial-level courts’ use of proportionality in their discovery grew dramatically following the 2015 amendments.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-347" href="#post-8648-footnote-347">[346]</a></sup> The uptick, however, does not demonstrate a necessary causal relationship between the increased use and the Year-End Reports.</p>
<p>Still, a search for federal cases citing the Year-End Reports in the same paragraph as the term “discovery” and a set of terms associated with the cost-and-delay narrative espoused by Chief Justice Roberts produced 142 results across twenty-five districts and one court of appeals since the issuance of the first report.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-348" href="#post-8648-footnote-348">[347]</a></sup> As a group, these discovery orders share a few characteristics of the discovery decisions citing <em>Twombly </em>or <em>Iqbal</em> discussed above.</p>
<p>Again, some trial-level courts deeply engage with the 2015 Year-End Report and the broader history of the role of proportionality within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-349" href="#post-8648-footnote-349">[348]</a></sup> And, in those districts, one sees other judges citing to their colleagues’ analysis.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-350" href="#post-8648-footnote-350">[349]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the references to the Year-End Reports appear to be part of stock language used by the specific judge or the district to describe a legal standard. For example, either the exact or a very slight variation of the language from <em>In re Takata Airbag Products Liability Litigation</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-351" href="#post-8648-footnote-351">[350]</a></sup> referencing the report is used by many judges in the Southern District of Florida, perhaps explaining why 44 of the 127 results are from that district.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-352" href="#post-8648-footnote-352">[351]</a></sup> The language has even spread to other districts in the state.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-353" href="#post-8648-footnote-353">[352]</a></sup> Judge Cole frequently quotes one of his earlier cases referencing the 2015 Year-End Report.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-354" href="#post-8648-footnote-354">[353]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both Judge Cole and Judge Browning cited either <em>Twombly</em> or <em>Iqbal</em> and the Year-End Reports in discovery decisions, which might reflect a particular alertness to the Supreme Court’s informal signaling.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-355" href="#post-8648-footnote-355">[354]</a></sup> This attentiveness, however, does not mean that the judges unthinkingly adopt the Roberts Court’s apparent antipathy to robust, liberal discovery. For example, Judge Cole has both granted and denied discovery on proportionality grounds after carefully attending to the specifics of the cases, including the non-pecuniary aspects that should factor into any proportionality analysis.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-356" href="#post-8648-footnote-356">[355]</a></sup> And Judge Browning more than once explicitly voiced his “concerns with the new amendments being pro-business and giving corporations new tools to limit plaintiffs’ discovery.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-357" href="#post-8648-footnote-357">[356]</a></sup></p>
<p>The findings discussed above demonstrate that the Roberts Court’s discovery dicta are having some effect on trial-level courts’ application. And this might provide some comfort—whether or not one agrees with the Roberts Court’s normative balancing—that the trial-level judges are not actually left to themselves to sort out the law but, instead, receive high-level (albeit, informal) appellate guidance.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-358" href="#post-8648-footnote-358">[357]</a></sup></p>
<p>While there are not an overwhelming number of illustrative trial-level decisions, it is quite likely that many other examples remain hidden. First, discovery orders often cannot be found on electronic databases because they are entered orally, as minute-orders on the docket, or are otherwise unpublished.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-359" href="#post-8648-footnote-359">[358]</a></sup> Second, trial-level courts might be influenced by the discovery dicta and other pronouncements without citing the Roberts Court as the source. For example, one Tenth Circuit case references a lower court applying <em>Twombly</em> in a discovery decision, but the underlying case was not on Westlaw.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-360" href="#post-8648-footnote-360">[359]</a></sup> Additionally, trial-level courts might cite intermediate appellate decisions or other trial-level decisions that reference the Supreme Court’s discovery dicta.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-361" href="#post-8648-footnote-361">[360]</a></sup> A case from the Third Circuit discussed <em>Iqbal</em>’s meaning for granting discovery stays.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-362" href="#post-8648-footnote-362">[361]</a></sup> Some trial-level decisions cite both <em>Mann</em><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-363" href="#post-8648-footnote-363">[362]</a></sup> and <em>Iqbal </em>in their analyses while others only cite <em>Mann</em>.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-364" href="#post-8648-footnote-364">[363]</a></sup> Likewise, there is one appellate court referencing the Year-End Reports in a discussion of the value of proportionality.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-365" href="#post-8648-footnote-365">[364]</a></sup> Of the four cases citing this Sixth Circuit case for the proposition that the 2015 amendments require an enhanced concern about proportionality, two cases do not reference the Year-End Reports themselves.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-366" href="#post-8648-footnote-366">[365]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="post-8648-_Toc95762000"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499987"></a>B. Second-Level Review by District Courts</h3>
<p>The main focus of this Article is the presence and effect of discovery in the Roberts Court’s jurisprudence. But, in thinking about how the system as a whole is responding to the absence of formal, traditional appellate review, the rise of magistrate judges must be acknowledged. The federal courts’ use of magistrate judges has grown rapidly over the past quarter-century.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111558079"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-367" href="#post-8648-footnote-367">[366]</a></sup> Between 1990 and 2014, civil referrals rose from 114,968 to 371,672.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-368" href="#post-8648-footnote-368">[367]</a></sup> Another study found that from 2013 to 2018, magistrate judges “took over 6.8 million actions in 2.6 million cases pending in district courts, or almost three actions per every open case.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-369" href="#post-8648-footnote-369">[368]</a></sup></p>
<p>Magistrate judges might even handle a majority of the pretrial discovery issues.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-370" href="#post-8648-footnote-370">[369]</a></sup> One study showed that magistrate judges are involved in about two-thirds of cases and about 75% of their rulings were on discovery motions.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-371" href="#post-8648-footnote-371">[370]</a></sup> Another recent survey of district court judges showed about 80% regularly refer discovery matters to magistrate judges.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-372" href="#post-8648-footnote-372">[371]</a></sup></p>
<p>This Article takes a targeted look at the interactions of magistrate judges and district court judges as they address discovery disputes. In reviewing almost one thousand district court decisions addressing appeals of magistrate judges’ orders or objections to reports and recommendations,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-373" href="#post-8648-footnote-373">[372]</a></sup> a theme emerged: the additional level of review appears to lead to some, if not all, of the traditional benefits that are associated with review by the courts of appeal. Specifically, the availability of second-level review lends itself to both error correction and law clarification.</p>
<p>In contrast to the difficulties of appealing a discovery decision to the circuit courts, litigants are guaranteed a limited review of a magistrate judge’s discovery decision. Both section 636(b)(1)(A) of Title 28 of the United States Code and Rule 72(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit litigants to object to a magistrate judge’s pretrial discovery order.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-374" href="#post-8648-footnote-374">[373]</a></sup> Under those authorities, the district judge may reverse a magistrate judge’s order that “is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-375" href="#post-8648-footnote-375">[374]</a></sup> The standard of review incorporates the two traditional functions of appellate review,<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-376" href="#post-8648-footnote-376">[375]</a></sup> placing them in the hands of the district judges.</p>
<p>At one end of its operation, there are very case-specific issues that turn on small, technical considerations and require correction without implicating any broader policy or legal concern. For example, a district judge reviewed a page of claimed work product and determined that its relevant information could be found in other produced material, and thus, the magistrate judge erred in finding that the requesting party had met its burden to overcome the work-product privilege.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-377" href="#post-8648-footnote-377">[376]</a></sup></p>
<p>District judges may also use their review of magistrate judges’ orders to refine and clarify the law. For example, a district judge reversed a magistrate judge’s order that compelled two former corporate officers to turn over company documents, noting that the original order did not correctly read Rule 34 and the cases interpreting the Rule’s use of the term “control.”<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-378" href="#post-8648-footnote-378">[377]</a></sup> Highlighting the significance of this correction, this case ultimately was heard by the Eleventh Circuit—a rare exception to the usual absence of appellate guidance.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-379" href="#post-8648-footnote-379">[378]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second-level review of the district judges can also define the law itself. Illustrating this, when a party objected to a magistrate judge’s order denying its motion for spoliation sanctions, a district court provided an in-depth discussion of Rule 37(e) sanctions following the 2015 amendments to the Rule.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-380" href="#post-8648-footnote-380">[379]</a></sup> In the past three years, this decision has already been cited twenty times by district court opinions within the circuit and eleven times by district courts outside of the circuit.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-381" href="#post-8648-footnote-381">[380]</a></sup> The emerging jurisprudence of technology-assisted review similarly grew out of a case in which the exchanges of the magistrate judge and district judge set forth a template that has been widely adopted.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-382" href="#post-8648-footnote-382">[381]</a></sup></p>
<p>The structural relationship between magistrate judges and district judges might also lead to greater uniformity within a district and provide a check against the individual caprice of a judge who, just by happenstance, is assigned to a case with a discovery dispute. An empirical study found that magistrate judges moderate their decisions to aim for the average of the judges in their district.<a id="post-8648-_Ref111558120"></a><sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-383" href="#post-8648-footnote-383">[382]</a></sup> Additionally, magistrate judges likely develop an expertise about discovery and the preferences of the various district judges to whom they report, which may be implicitly communicated through their orders and recommendations.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-384" href="#post-8648-footnote-384">[383]</a></sup> And, even though a magistrate judge’s order is appealed to yet another single-member judging body, the second-level review should still provide some reassurance to litigants that they are being treated fairly. Illustrating this, a district court reversed a magistrate judge’s order granting a defendant’s motion for a protective order where the plaintiff was not given an opportunity to respond—a legal error that sounds in procedural due process.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-385" href="#post-8648-footnote-385">[384]</a></sup></p>
<p>Review by a district court judge is distinct from that of an appellate judge, so the analogy is not perfect. One significant difference is that the district court’s review does not provide an opportunity for direct conversations amongst decision makers who might have different viewpoints but the same level of authority.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-386" href="#post-8648-footnote-386">[385]</a></sup></p>
<p>There also is a different set of relationships between magistrate judges and district court judges than between the latter and appellate judges.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-387" href="#post-8648-footnote-387">[386]</a></sup> Magistrate judges are selected by the district court judges and are subject to their authority without the protections of an Article III judgeship such as lifetime appointments.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-388" href="#post-8648-footnote-388">[387]</a></sup></p>
<p>There also are different social relationships because magistrate judges sit in close proximity to the district court judges who oversee them and get to know them personally.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-389" href="#post-8648-footnote-389">[388]</a></sup> And, while a district court judge may reverse a magistrate judge’s discovery ruling, there is no formal precedential effect, so the law-development aspects are presumably less strong than when there is formal review from the circuit courts or the Supreme Court.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-390" href="#post-8648-footnote-390">[389]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="post-8648-_Toc95762001"></a><a id="post-8648-_Toc130499988"></a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>By looking at every reference to “discovery” in the Roberts Court’s jurisprudence and hundreds of district courts’ review of magistrate judges’ discovery orders, this Article sees that two interrelated truisms of discovery are not entirely correct. First, the view that discovery does not significantly feature in appellate-court opinions fails to account for how concerns about the costs of discovery exert a meaningful influence on the outcomes of non-discovery cases. This finding should concern all critics of the rights-retrenchment movement of the federal courts as the Roberts Court seeds the cost-and-delay narrative within its jurisprudence to limit access to justice.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-391" href="#post-8648-footnote-391">[390]</a></sup> Second, the assumption that discovery is beset by a lack of error correction and law clarification because of the absence of formal appellate guidance fails to recognize the normative guidance provided by the Supreme Court’s dicta and the quasi-appellate review happening within the two trial-level layers.</p>
<p>In addition to refining our collective understanding of discovery in the federal system, the importance of identifying this jury-rigged system of error correction and law development is heightened when one considers the factors that might unsettle the existing equilibrium. First, the continuing growth of electronically stored information might disrupt judging norms and place even more pressure on the magistrate judges.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-392" href="#post-8648-footnote-392">[391]</a></sup> Second, the availability of unpublished discovery orders provides both parties and judges with much more information and possibly incentives to guide the development of discovery law.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-393" href="#post-8648-footnote-393">[392]</a></sup> Third, the growth of multi-district litigation already might be encouraging litigants to expend the resources necessary to put discovery issues before appellate courts.<sup><a id="post-8648-footnote-ref-394" href="#post-8648-footnote-394">[393]</a></sup> Depending on how each of these three factors develops, we might expect to see either an increase or decrease in discovery appeals. And, either way, both courts and litigants should be aware of how that future will be scaffolded onto our existing world of makeshift appellate guidance on the law of discovery.</p>
