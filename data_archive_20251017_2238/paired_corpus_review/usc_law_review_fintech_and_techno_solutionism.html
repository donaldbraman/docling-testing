									<p><em>Silicon Valley–style technological innovation is ill-suited to address complex problems like financial inclusion and concentrated market power, yet promises abound that “fintech” can fix them. This oversimplified reduction of complex structural problems into technological puzzles has been critiqued as “techno-solutionism,” and it poses real dangers for public policy. When we start with the tech industry’s favored tools and then ask how to solve complex problems using those tools—rather than starting by defining the problem to be solved—it can distract policymakers from supporting real, structural solutions. Techno-solutionism can also deter policymakers from interrogating the limitations, and regulating the harms, of the proffered technological solutions.</em></p><p><em>This Article argues that not only are many fintech products themselves extremely techno-solutionist, but techno-solutionism is also impeding financial regulation’s ability to protect the public from fintech’s harms. It makes several contributions: First, this Article introduces into the financial regulation literature theories of how the law can perpetuate, and then be stymied by, techno-solutionism. Second, it comprehensively calls out the techno-solutionism inherent in many fintech offerings (particularly crypto), laying bare their harms and demonstrating where they are unable to solve the problems they claim to address. Such harmful nonsolutions do not warrant accommodative regulatory treatment—and yet, some policymakers have sought to give fintech products just that. This Article’s third contribution is a detailed exploration of techno-solutionism’s impact on U.S. financial regulatory policy as it pertains to fintech. This Article also uses this lens to consider how techno-solutionism might impact the regulation of AI in financial services.</em></p><p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc179271036"></a><a name="_Toc193226122"></a>Introduction</h3><p>Technology has been an integral part of finance for a long time, but the rise of “fintech” has placed Silicon Valley–style technological innovation front and center in financial services. New technologies and technology-based business models have been developed as putative solutions to the limitations of the financial system, but fintech often fails to address the problems it claims to solve. Instead, fintech tends to create new problems that remain unaddressed because of misguided assumptions that technology can fix any problem—including the ones it causes. This “mistaken belief that we can make great progress on alleviating complex dilemmas, if not remedy them entirely, by reducing their core issues to simpler engineering problems” has been dubbed “techno-solutionism.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Evan Selinger, The Delusion at the Center of the A.I.

Techno-solutionism is often evident in conversations about the financial applications of technologies like artificial intelligence (“AI”), blockchain, cloud computing, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”), which have been promoted as having the power to make the delivery of financial services more inclusive, more efficient, more competitive, and more secure. While there may be promise in some fintech business models, this Article explains why fintech’s ability to solve long-standing, complex problems is often oversold. This Article also explores how techno-solutionist fintech hype can distract from more meaningful solutions to long-standing problems and obscure fintech’s harms.</p><p>Fintech marketing has correctly identified many of the pain points in traditional finance, but these pain points are largely structural problems that cannot be addressed by tech-centric business models that disregard economic and political realities. In this regard, fintech solutions are emblematic of a broader techno-solutionist Silicon Valley worldview that disregards context—as Silicon Valley historian Margaret O’Mara describes it, “Why care about history when you were building the future?”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Margaret O’Mara, The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America 7 (2020)."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-2">2</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-2" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="2">Margaret O’Mara, The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America 7 (2020).</span> Unfortunately, despite the flimsiness of many fintech promises—and despite the harms that many fintech business models have inflicted on the public—techno-solutionist rhetoric about fintech’s potential has been stubbornly resilient. This rhetoric sets the scene for a “wait-and-see” legal environment designed to allow these technological solutions to flourish without regulatory intervention. This Article argues that such accommodative inaction is unacceptable, given how damaging financial harms (to individuals, and to the broader economy) can be, but unfortunately lawmakers and financial regulators have been encouraged to internalize a techno-solutionist perspective by the fintech businesses and venture capitalists who will profit from such accommodative legal treatment.</p><p>Techno-solutionism is not a purely private sector creation, however. Sometimes—whether through the expressive value of their words or the more concrete impacts of their action or inaction—lawmakers and financial regulators perpetuate the very techno-solutionism that will ultimately undermine their ability to protect the public from harm. If financial regulators are convinced or forced to get out of the way so that technological innovation can go ahead and fix things, then that will create a conducive environment for the fintech industry and its funders to arbitrage regulatory requirements and perhaps even harden that arbitrage into durable legal permissions (a strategy known as “regulatory entrepreneurship”).<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="3" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Elizabeth Pollman &amp; Jordan M.

This Article also examines nascent regulatory approaches to AI’s financial applications through this lens.</p><p>The primary aim of this Article is to identify and describe the problems that techno-solutionism creates for financial regulatory policy but that of course invites questions about what can be done to remedy the situation. Recognizing that techno-solutionism is a heuristic that probably will not be eliminated without an alternative, this Article argues that financial regulators and lawmakers should instead adopt a posture of contextually informed skepticism that draws on domain knowledge about what can go wrong in finance and is sensitive to the harms that fintech may cause. Of course, there are many structural impediments to such a shift in perspective and it will not be easily accomplished. Right now, the best that we can do may be to simply call out the phenomenon of techno-solutionism where we see it and, in doing so, rob it of some of its power.</p><p>The rest of this Article will proceed as follows: Part I will explore the concept of techno-solutionism, emphasizing its dangers for public policy as a general matter. Part I will also provide some insight into techno-solutionism’s relationship with the venture capital industry and with the law. Part II will look more specifically at fintech technologies and business models and expose the techno-solutionism inherent in fintech’s claims to improve financial inclusion, efficiency, competition, and security. Part III will explore the relationship between financial regulation and techno-solutionism, looking at legislative proposals and administrative actions relating to crypto and other fintech. Part III will also consider prospectively how techno-solutionism may impact regulation of the use of AI in financial services. Part IV suggests a posture of contextually informed skepticism as an alternative to techno-solutionism, before the final Part concludes.</p><h3>I.  <a name="_Toc179271037"></a><a name="_Toc193226123"></a>Techno-Solutionism</h3><h4>A.  <a name="_Toc179271038"></a><a name="_Toc193226124"></a>What Is Techno-Solutionism?</h4><p>In his 2023 <em>Techno-Optimist Manifesto</em>, leading venture capitalist Marc Andreessen stated his belief that “there is no material problem—whether created by nature or by technology—that cannot be solved with more technology.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="4" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Marc Andreessen, The Techno-Optimist Manifesto, Andreessen Horowitz (Oct. 16, 2023), https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto [https://perma.cc/42BC-7JUN]."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-4">4</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-4" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="4">Marc Andreessen, The Techno-Optimist Manifesto, Andreessen Horowitz (Oct. 16, 2023), <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto" rel="nofollow">https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto</a> [https://perma.cc/42BC-7JUN].</span> This techno-optimist sentiment has a long heritage: in his book <em>American Technological Sublime</em>, David Nye recounts that technological achievements, ranging from “the first railroads, suspension bridges, skyscrapers, city skylines” to “atomic explosions, and the rockets of the space program” have been central to the American national identity for centuries.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="5" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="David E.

If public authorities remain mindful of potential harms and deploy incentives and subsidies as part of a portfolio strategy that also considers where direct public investment might be more effective, such an approach is likely to broadly benefit society. Unfortunately, the political landscape in the United States has evolved in such a way that the deck is often stacked against pursuing public sector solutions: Mazzucato attributes this in part to “the emergence of ‘new public management’ theory, which grew out of ‘public choice’ theory in the 1980s,” and “led civil servants to believe that they should take up as little space as possible, fearing that government failures may be even worse than market failures.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="86" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Mazzucato, supra note 48, at xxiii."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-86">86</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-86" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="86">Mazzucato, supra note 48, at xxiii.</span> How to encourage public innovation is an important topic, but it is beyond the scope of this Article.

Regulatory entrepreneurship capitalizes on the pacing problem, seeking to grow “too big to ban” before the law catches up. But it is not inevitable that the law will fall hopelessly behind technological development. Ultimately, refusing to apply the law to a technology until after it is fully developed and entrenched—and then crafting accommodative laws that treat the extant incarnation of technology-based business models as inevitable—is a choice. That choice, which can stymie the harm-reduction functions of law, is often encouraged by cognitive capture, donations, and lobbying, all of which are part of the regulatory entrepreneurship playbook.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="110" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="As Pollman and Barry observe,The regulatory entrepreneur may push social policy away from the optimal outcome.

While pitched as a solution to some of the barriers to competition discussed in Section II.C, the rise of open banking implicates important questions about information security that we need to grapple with. Most obviously, using insecure APIs to transmit data creates opportunities for data breaches, fraud, and identity theft (fintech lending business models that assemble extensive non-traditional data profiles to address the creditworthiness of their users will also be attractive targets for such practices).<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="269" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="The information economy has given rise to a “seemingly continuous stream of major data breaches and epidemic levels of fraud and identity theft” where “vulnerability is a given, and eventual loss seems only a matter of time.” Cohen, supra note 17, at 101."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-269">269</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-269" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="269">The information economy has given rise to a “seemingly continuous stream of major data breaches and epidemic levels of fraud and identity theft” where “vulnerability is a given, and eventual loss seems only a matter of time.” Cohen, supra note 17, at 101.</span> But the sharing of data contemplated by open banking will also generate more subtle threats to our informational security, in the form of increased surveillance by an increased number of parties who can then use that data to manipulate us and others like us.</p><p>Raul Carillo has noted that fintech firms, like other technology companies, “reconstitute people into ‘data doubles,’ which can then be sorted, stored, scored, shared, and sold.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="270" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Carillo, supra note 75, at 1210."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-270">270</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-270" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="270">Carillo, supra note 75, at 1210.</span> The increased sophistication of machine learning technology is only making this kind of data more valuable.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="271" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Solow-Niederman, supra note 149, at 6."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-271">271</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-271" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="271">Solow-Niederman, supra note 149, at 6.</span> Data about consumers’ payments are particularly valuable, because those data yield rich, detailed, and unvarnished insights into how individuals behave and what they value.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="272" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Carillo, supra note 75, at 1211.

We have decades of experience with many of the kinds of harms that fintech is inflicting, and many of the problems raised in Part II have solutions based in existing legal remedies. The fact that new technologies have come to play an increasingly important role in delivering financial services has sometimes been weaponized (through cognitive capture and related strategies) to obscure the applicability of existing law, but we should not unquestioningly accept the premise that all previous grants of regulatory authority (and the rules implementing them) are hopelessly outmoded and obsolete as a result of technological change.</p><p>This Section will look at fintech-specific legislative proposals and administrative actions that illustrate how techno-solutionism is impacting the creation of new financial regulation, and the implementation of existing financial regulation (this is not a comprehensive survey of all fintech-related financial regulation to date, but instead a series of illustrative examples).

However, a posture of technological neutrality can turn out to be accommodative in practice if regulators are too amenable to the fintech industry’s own techno-solutionist descriptions of activities and risks as novel, or if regulators assume that the technology is just another way of discharging an existing economic function and won’t pose any sui generis risks of its own.</p><p>Regulators should dig beneath the techno-solutionism to ask fundamental preliminary questions about whether a technology actually performs the activity its purveyors say it performs—otherwise regulators may mistakenly apply the wrong regulatory regime. They also need to ask whether changes in technological delivery mechanisms are creating new kinds of risks (for example, new technology-related operational risks). Although existing regulatory approaches will often be useful, sometimes new methods will need to be devised in order to discharge existing mandates in a financial system populated by new technologies. Regulators should not be deterred from developing these new methods by a desire to be perceived as technology neutral.</p><p>Unfortunately, reality does not always meet these ideals.

When it comes to fixing finance, technological innovation will not obviate the need for the hard slog of structural reform.

If financial regulators can resist cognitive capture and enforce existing laws such that regulatory arbitrage and regulatory entrepreneurship are not profitable strategies, then technology is more likely to deliver benefits without serious social harms. Where technologies pose genuinely new problems, then Congressional action will be needed, and that action should also proceed from a position of contextually informed skepticism. To slightly adapt testimony from AI and privacy expert Woody Hartzog, “[l]awmakers will make little progress until they accept that the toothpaste is never out of the tube when it comes to questioning and curtailing the design and deployment of [technology] for the betterment of society.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="456" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Hartzog Testimony, supra note 17, at 11."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-456">456</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a510000000000000000_14874-456" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="456">Hartzog Testimony, supra note 17, at 11.</span></p><p> </p>								</div>

Many thanks to Tonantzin Carmona, Julie Cohen, Jeremy Kress, Pat McCoy, Chris Odinet, Art Wilmarth, and Jeff Zhang for reading and providing feedback on earlier drafts. This paper also benefitted enormously from comments and conversations during workshops at the University of Florida, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the IMF’s Internal Fintech Forum, and the meeting of the Technology Section at the Academy of Legal Studies in Business Conference. Information regarding the status of technologies, regulation, and legislation is current as of October 2024, but these are used to illustrate broader themes that will remain relevant as new technologies and regulatory and legislative approaches evolve.</p></div>
