									<h3><a name="_Toc203329054"></a>Introduction</h3><p>Current debates about campus speech often conflate two related but importantly distinct values: free speech and academic freedom. Both are widely perceived to be in crisis,<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Mary Anne Franks, The Miseducation of Free Speech, 105 Va.

Many of the most fundamental challenges—indeed, much of what makes campus speech unique in the first place—arise from the need to accommodate both values. In doing so, defenders of academic freedom must, as advocates of free speech have, more clearly articulate an account of listener interests. The basic project of this Article is to frame that challenge and take a few initial steps toward answering it.</p><p>The most prominent (and successful, at least if success is measured by legislative and popular action) critics of the campus speech climate are invoking a free speech paradigm. Their central complaint is that faculty, administrators, and students are selectively silencing speakers and ideas. The paradigmatic victims are often isolated conservative voices,<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Keck, supra note 1 (manuscript at 9) (“The archetypical beneficiary of free speech in these statements is the lonely conservative dissenter from left-liberal campus orthodoxy.”)."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-2">2</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-2" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="2">Keck, supra note 1 (manuscript at 9) (“The archetypical beneficiary of free speech in these statements is the lonely conservative dissenter from left-liberal campus orthodoxy.”).</span> faculty and speakers attacked for things they write or say,<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="3" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="See, e.g., Deirdre Bardolf, Disturbing Audio Captures Anti-Racism Instructor Attacking Principal’s “White Supremacy” Before He Killed Himself, N.Y.

In that sense, they invoke free speech but are not actually rooted in the free speech tradition.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="7" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Thanks to Ash Bhagwat for pressing me on this point.

Getting a handle on the campus speech debate therefore requires a clear account of listener interests, as this symposium invites. Doing so is especially important because many of the interventions flowing from the listener-based free speech critique are in tension with, and sometimes flagrantly undermine, the other essential element of campus speech: academic freedom. That freedom has many dimensions, each with its own value proposition: “freedom of research and publication, freedom in the classroom, freedom of intramural speech, and freedom of extramural speech.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="8" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Matthew W.

Doing so is not only important as a matter of rhetorical strategy, but necessary for a full and accurate description of academic freedom’s value.

On the one hand, the freedom of teaching (one prong of academic freedom) is undeniably rooted in students’ interests as listeners. On the other hand, students-as-listeners—despite being an arguably captive audience, lacking power vis-à-vis their professors—do not have a broad right <em>not </em>to listen, as many First Amendment principles suggest. Moreover, their rights as listeners vary significantly depending on the setting: classrooms and other curricular settings, guest speakers and other extracurricular events, and their dorm rooms.</p><p>Faculty are the prototypical speakers in the academic freedom paradigm, but they are also important listeners; the communal nature of knowledge production through research and publication requires as much.

Most obviously and explicitly, many campuses have established various “free speech zones” in which students, faculty, and perhaps others can express themselves subject only to relatively narrow limitations for harassment, true threats, and the like. That same broad freedom might extend, whether declared or not, to other areas of a university campus such as open quads, streets, and other arguable analogues of public fora. Indeed, many universities claim to have broad or even absolute commitments to speech and are regularly evaluated or even ranked based on that basis.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="27" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="See Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, supra note 4."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-27">27</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-27" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="27">See Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, supra note 4.</span></p><p>The free speech paradigm also plays an important role in the scholarly enterprise that is at the heart of the university.

The latter line has become particularly prominent in the wake of the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel, and has led to allegations of inconsistency and even hypocrisy on all sides. Whatever one thinks about those complaints, the point is that both are rooted in audience impact. Defenders of the academic freedom paradigm, by contrast, have done little to articulate the listener interests at stake for scholarly speech. The result is that listener interests are being used to turn free speech against academic freedom.</p><p>This is perhaps most evident in the strenuous critiques, mostly but not exclusively from the political right, alleging that universities are systematically underprotecting freedom of speech. Some critics have focused on the harms to speakers,<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="45" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="See supra notes 3–6 and sources cited therein."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-45">45</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-45" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="45">See supra notes 3–6 and sources cited therein.</span> occasionally making martyrs out of provocateurs and others whose potential contributions to knowledge-producing discourse are marginal at best.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="46" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Franks, supra note 1, at 238 (“Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter, and their ilk are not experts, or professors, or intellectuals.

That critique takes multiple forms as well. One emphasizes the danger that conservative students will be alienated and harmed in campus settings where they cannot hear voices like their own or that students who are not exposed to such ideas will be indoctrinated with liberal orthodoxy.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="47" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="See generally David Horowitz, Indoctrination U.: The Left’s War Against Academic Freedom (2007) (arguing that American universities have been hijacked by leftist radical pushing an ideological curriculum).

Students might earnestly believe that they should be free to shape their identity and preferences by avoiding particular information. But that will not excuse them from curricular requirements regarding those topics.</p><p>There are ways to blunt the tension. One might say that students have, by enrolling in a program with transparent requirements, autonomously pursued their “instrumental interest in gaining access to information and ideals that will assist the hearer in making rational, informed choices,” and that their objections to any particular steps along the way should be subsumed to the larger autonomous choice. This effectively treats the students’ choice to listen as a kind of rolling consent. After all, the student version of academic freedom traces itself to the German <em>Lernfreiheit</em>, or freedom to learn, which originally “referred simply to the freedom to choose one’s course of study.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="93" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Menand, supra note 14."  role="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-describedby="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-93">93</a></sup><span id="mfn-content-0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267-93" role="tooltip" class="modern-footnotes-footnote__note" tabindex="0" data-mfn="93">Menand, supra note 14.</span></p><p>Of course, none of this means that students do or should have <em>no </em>say in the curriculum.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="94" data-mfn-post-scope="0000000000000a4f0000000000000000_15267"><a href="javascript:void(0)"  title="Bridges, supra note 56, at 810 nn. 21 &amp; 22 (collecting sources showing how law students have been challenging curricular requirements and the content of other required courses).

One is distorting understandings of the campus speech climate by treating the actions of a few students at a few schools as if they are representative of the millions of students across the country. Another is amplifying the supposed interests of would-be speakers, some of whom are neither seeking nor likely to communicate anything of academic interest.

L. Rev. 868, 894 (2014).</span> scholars and judges have identified and explored the status and role of listeners in giving life to the freedom of speech and the rights of speakers. For doctrinal and technological reasons, those inquiries are as important today as they have ever been, and this symposium is an invitation to take them further. The goal of this Article has been to suggest some ways in which consideration of listener interests might illuminate current debates about campus speech. Students’ interests as listeners are essential to justifying the freedom to teach, and yet students do not have the full panoply of listener-associated interests one might find in other speech contexts. Faculty, meanwhile, are generally treated as the paradigm speaker in campus speech controversies, but also have essential rights and duties as listeners; the production of knowledge through disciplinarity requires as much. And the academy’s authority to govern itself according to disciplinary standards is fundamentally predicated on convincing the public—a broad but essential audience—that the scholarly enterprise is in fact generating valuable knowledge.</p><p>* * *</p><p> </p>								</div>
