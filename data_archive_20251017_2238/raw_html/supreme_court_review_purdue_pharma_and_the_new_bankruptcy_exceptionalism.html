Purdue Pharma L.P.</i><a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn1" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> is about whether the text of the United States Bankruptcy Code gives courts the authority to approve nonconsensual third-party releases in Chapter 11.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn2" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Section 1123(b)(6) of the Code allows Chapter 11 plans of reorganization to âinclude any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn3" href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> The question posed to the Court in <i>Purdue</i> was whether that language encompasses nonconsensual third-party releases. The majority concluded it does not. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for a four-Justice dissent, disagreed.</p><p> Although both the majority and dissent anchored their arguments in the text of Section 1123, non-textual concerns featured prominently in both opinions. For his part, Justice Kavanaugh emphasized that bankruptcy law is designed to address the kind of collective-action problems that arise in mass tort cases like <i>Purdue</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn4" href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> He further argued that third-party releases are an important tool in facilitating a collective resolution.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn5" href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> The majority, by contrast, expressed concern that bankruptcy courts operate as if they have a âroving commission to resolve all such problems that happen [their] way, blind to the role other mechanisms (legislation, class actions, multi-district litigation, consensual settlements, among others) play in addressing them.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn6" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p> A version of this concern has long troubled courts and academics, who have argued that bankruptcy courts exercise too much discretion and too much power. These critiques typically refer to a concept of âbankruptcy exceptionalism.â Often the concern is that a non-Article III tribunal (the bankruptcy court) wields Article III powers.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn7" href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> As we explain in Part I, we are skeptical that there is anything exceptional about these powers. All courts exercise discretion and fill gaps, and bankruptcy court discretion is firmly rooted in the text of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to de novo review in an Article III tribunal.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn8" href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> Still, since the Code was enacted, the concern that bankruptcy courts possess too much authority and too much discretion has been the basis of numerous constitutional decisions limiting the power of bankruptcy courts.</p><p> An important but misunderstood feature of the <i>Purdue</i> decision, however, is that the Supreme Court did not address any constitutional issues, at least not directly. With regard to Article III, the Second Circuit, in affirming the use of third-party releases, had decided that de novo review by an Article III court was required but noted it was providing that review.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn9" href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> Thus, the question before the Supreme Court was not whether a bankruptcy court could approve the releases, but whether an Article III court hearing bankruptcy cases could. And yet, the majority repeatedly framed its inquiry as being about the power of <i>bankruptcy</i> courts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn10" href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p> As a result, the opinion is flush with exceptionalist rhetoric about expansive bankruptcy court power while the holding does not address the issue head on. Instead, the Court develops a new statutory canon of constraint that narrowly construes terms in the Bankruptcy Codeâlike âappropriate,â ânecessary,â and âfair and equitableââto cabin judicial authority in bankruptcy cases.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn11" href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> This, we argue, represents a new bankruptcy exceptionalism in which broad statutory provisions that should be interpreted by their plain meaning are narrowed to constrain the powers of bankruptcy courts.</p><p> This new bankruptcy exceptionalism will be disruptive to bankruptcy practiceâfar beyond what the <i>Purdue</i> Court contemplated. The Court explicitly left several issues like consensual releases and full-satisfaction plans unresolved. Those issues are now percolating through the lower courts, producing inconsistent approaches by different judgesâeven those within the same district.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn12" href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> And many other innovative bankruptcy tools which find support in the broad language of the Code are now in doubt. These include substantive consolidation, third-party injunctions, and for-cause dismissal. Indeed, one of the foundational pillars of Chapter 11âs statutory structure is its requirement that a plan can be confirmed only if it âdoes not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitableâ to dissenting impaired classes.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn13" href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> This language carries with it a long history of doctrine, judicial gloss, and discretionary invocation to prevent debtor misbehavior.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn14" href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> It does not, however, come with a statutory definition.</p><p> A canon of narrowing broad language and constraining bankruptcy judges thus draws into question the scope and meaning of these provisions and many of the common tools of the practice. If this new approach sticks, it could create barriers to collective resolution by incentivizing parties, lawyers, and bankruptcy judges to find workarounds that are immune to appellate scrutiny.</p><p> This Article explores these developments in three parts. Part I describes and critiques conventional scholarly claims about bankruptcy exceptionalism. Part II presents the Supreme Courtâs approach to bankruptcy over the last four decades. While the Court has historically questioned the constitutionality of bankruptcy courts in a direct fashion, we speculate that <i>Purdue</i> marks the culmination of the Courtâs shift toward a canon that reads broad provisions in the Code narrowly to protect Article III power while avoiding direct constitutional questions. Part III considers how this new bankruptcy exceptionalism will affect bankruptcy practice and incentivize costly workarounds.</p><div class="section" id="sc1"><div id="ac_i1" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i1">I.Â  The Scholarly Account of Bankruptcy Exceptionalism</h2><p> Justice Gorsuchâs majority opinion was expressing a familiar sentiment about the U.S. bankruptcy system. For years, scholars and courts have asserted, often critically, that federal bankruptcy powers are exceptional.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn15" href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> For example, Pamela Foohey and Jonathan Lipson recently celebrated the <i>Purdue</i> decision for pushing back against bankruptcy exceptionalism, which in their view âreflects a willingness to bend the rule of law.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn16" href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> Likewise, Jonathan Seymour has praised recent Supreme Court decisions for rejecting âbankruptcy exceptionalism,â arguing exceptionalism âexacerbates corrosive trends within the bankruptcy system that cannot readily be corrected by other courts, especially in the field of corporate reorganizations.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn17" href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p> What exactly do scholars and courts mean when they describe bankruptcy courts as exceptional? At first glance, some common descriptions seem unremarkable. Bankruptcy courts fill gaps, find exceptions to general rules, craft equitable remedies, and take account of unwritten norms. But so do judges in all courts in the United States.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn18" href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a> So there would need to be something distinctive about bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy practiceâsomething more fundamentalâto set them apart.</p><p> To us the most plausible account of the bankruptcy exceptionalism critique would reflect a concern that bankruptcy courts are using the Codeâs broad grants of authorityâfor example Sections like 105(a) and 1123(b)(6)<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn19" href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a>âto resolve issues that would ordinarily be adjudicated elsewhere but, because of the exigencies of financial distress, can more efficiently be resolved in a single proceeding. To understand this as problematic assumes that Article III courts should play a special role in private litigation, and that the availability of appellate review does not protect that special role.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn20" href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a> A critic of exceptionalism might also worry here that bankruptcy courts are resolving too many issues too quickly, and in a manner inconsistent with due process or Article III values.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn21" href="#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p> In the remainder of this Part, we explore these different accounts of bankruptcy exceptionalism. We start with the weak version focused on the exercise of equitable discretion and then move to more substantial claims grounded in constitutional concerns of due process, structure, and separation of powers.</p><div class="section" id="sc1.1"><div id="ac_i2" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i2">A.Â  The Weak Version of Exceptionalism: Discretion</h3><p> Some critics describe bankruptcy courts as exceptional for exercising discretion. Because this same discretion is exercised by other federal and state courts, in our view, these accounts reflect an anti-bankruptcy bias that has long permeated academic scholarship.</p><p> One account suggests there are both benign and malignant forms of bankruptcy exceptionalism. Of the benign, the authors say:<div class="quote"><p> [I]n truth we are all exceptionalists to some extent. No one seriously argues that bankruptcy courts lack equitable discretion to recognize exceptions to general rulesâ¦ .<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn22" href="#fn22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></div>This description is puzzling. Remove the word bankruptcy and the passage describes a common feature in law. Equitable discretionâthe power to fashion exceptions to general rulesâis part of the day-to-day functioning of courts, as is the power to grant traditional equitable remedies when appropriate.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn23" href="#fn23"><sup>23</sup></a> Of course, the exercise of equitable discretion comes up more often in some cases than others.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn24" href="#fn24"><sup>24</sup></a> A case seeking an injunction will look different from a case seeking contract damages. But common-law systems have been working out those differences since long before the Constitutionâs Bankruptcy Clause was drafted.</p><p> At times, critics of bankruptcy exceptionalism shift between using the term âequityâ in the colloquial sense of discretion and the more formal sense of the doctrines and remedies available in a traditional court of chancery.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn25" href="#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a> Talk of bankruptcy courts as âcourts of equityâ<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn26" href="#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a> would seem to invoke the latter use of the term, but the discussion is rarely that precise. In identifying the acts of equitable discretion in bankruptcy cases, the criticism is often more about everyday discretion pursuant to statutory grants of authority.</p><p> The <i>Purdue</i> case highlights the imprecision. The direct question to the Court was unquestionably about a statutory grant of discretion. The debtorsâ argument relied primarily on the power granted in Section 1123(b)(6) to defend the releases.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn27" href="#fn27"><sup>27</sup></a> But nonconsensual third-party releases are structured as channeling injunctions to protect the estate, which are traditional equitable remedies. And so, one would expect some discussion of equity in the more formal sense. Indeed, as we pointed out in an amicus brief, examples of nondebtor releases imposed by the Lord Chancellor date at least as far back as 1619.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn28" href="#fn28"><sup>28</sup></a> Likewise, the Second Circuit had noted that releases should be viewed against the âbackdrop of equity.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn29" href="#fn29"><sup>29</sup></a> But the Courtâs opinion eschews any reference to equitable remedies and focuses instead on colloquial discretion.</p><p> In any event, bankruptcy courts are federal courts, and the federal judicial system has not recognized a distinction between courts of law and equity since 1938.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn30" href="#fn30"><sup>30</sup></a> The federal courts today are not structured separately such that some administer law and others equity. Rather, federal courts simply issue equitable remedies (in the traditional sense) or exercise equitable discretion (colloquially) as circumstances require.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn31" href="#fn31"><sup>31</sup></a> Within any case, a federal court might invoke the formal law-equity distinction when determining which remedies and procedures are available in a particular dispute.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn32" href="#fn32"><sup>32</sup></a></p><p> To foreshadow a bit, the Courtâs dismissive approach to formal equitable doctrines in bankruptcy cases is consistent with our view of a new bankruptcy exceptionalism. One would think equitable remedies are still available in all federal cases. The notion that this would not be true in a bankruptcy case is exceptional.</p><p> Another criticism of bankruptcy courts as exceptional comes from Seymour, who has presented the most thorough and sophisticated account of bankruptcy exceptionalism. He observes:<div class="quote"><p> Everywhere in bankruptcy, judges alter rights, create remedies, and steer cases out of fidelity to unwritten norms that seek to advance what those within the bankruptcy culture understand to be the better and more efficient functioning of the bankruptcy system. Various scholars have attempted to describe and systemize these norms.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn33" href="#fn33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></div></p><p> Again, we ask: What is exceptional here? It is easy for those in a certain field to convince themselves that what they are doing is âspecialâ or âunique.â But unwritten norms appear throughout our legal system, and courts regularly challenge or push back on those norms.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn34" href="#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a> Recounting specific unwritten norms is useful to understanding bankruptcy law,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn35" href="#fn35"><sup>35</sup></a> just as it is useful in understanding other areas of law. Bankruptcy cases may require the exercise of judicial discretion <i>more often</i> than civil cases,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn36" href="#fn36"><sup>36</sup></a> but bankruptcy courts use the same methods and procedures as other courts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn37" href="#fn37"><sup>37</sup></a> Thus, whatever differences exist are a matter of degree rather than kind. The claim that bankruptcy courts are exceptional because they craft remedies, alter rights, and observe or rely on unwritten norms strikes us as a peculiarly narrow and parochial view.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc1.2"><div id="ac_i3" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i3">B.Â  The Strong Version of Exceptionalism: Authority, Structure, and Due Process</h3><p> The previous Section deals with some of the rhetoric used in discussing bankruptcy exceptionalism. Other accounts suggest the underlying concern is about the constitutionality of bankruptcy procedure. We turn now to those accounts.</p><p> 1. <i>Substantive Authority</i>. Congressâs authority to create bankruptcy law comes from the Constitutionâs Bankruptcy Clause.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn38" href="#fn38"><sup>38</sup></a> The substantive limits of this power are broad but untested.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn39" href="#fn39"><sup>39</sup></a> Often, then, the real question is about statutory interpretation: What has Congress authorized?</p><p> One criticism of bankruptcy courts as exceptional is that they exercise more authority than granted to them by Congress. That position, however, disregards the plain text of the Bankruptcy Code, which contains broad language delegating discretion and authority to courts. The discretionary powers bankruptcy courts possess are based not on an antiquarian notion that they are âcourts of equityâ or that they exercise âequitable powers,â but rather on specific provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that delegate authority to bankruptcy courts and empower the courts to respond to novel or complex issues. For example, Section 1123(b)(6) gives a bankruptcy court authority to approve a plan that includes âany other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn40" href="#fn40"><sup>40</sup></a> Section 1112(b) allows a court to dismiss a case âfor cause.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn41" href="#fn41"><sup>41</sup></a> Section 364(d) provides that a court âmay authorizeâ the debtor to obtain credit if certain conditions are met, including a finding that the affected parties have received âadequate protection.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn42" href="#fn42"><sup>42</sup></a> Section 510(c) provides that a court âmay under principles of equitable subordination, subordinate an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest to all or part of another allowed interest.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn43" href="#fn43"><sup>43</sup></a> Section 1129(a) requires that a plan of reorganization have been âproposed in good faith.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn44" href="#fn44"><sup>44</sup></a> And Section 1129(b) requires that a nonconsensual plan be âfair and equitableâ and that it not âdiscriminate unfairlyâ to be approved.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn45" href="#fn45"><sup>45</sup></a> These provisions all explicitly delegate policymaking authority and discretion to bankruptcy courts, establishing clear statutory grounds for flexible and responsive judicial decision-making.</p><p> And then there is Section 105(a), which gives bankruptcy courts authority to âissue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn46" href="#fn46"><sup>46</sup></a> This language allows for some gap-filling by bankruptcy judges.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn47" href="#fn47"><sup>47</sup></a> While Section 105(a) gets a lot of attention and is criticized as a source of bankruptcy exceptionalism, it is quite the opposite. The language of 105(a) mirrors the language of the All Writs Act,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn48" href="#fn48"><sup>48</sup></a> originally enacted in 1789, which grants similar powers to other federal courts. Thus, Section 105(a) merely gives bankruptcy courts the same powers that other courts possess elsewhere.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn49" href="#fn49"><sup>49</sup></a></p><p> 2. <i>Procedural Authority and Constitutional Structure</i>. Procedurally things are a bit more complicated. Congress established an elaborate and complicated system for the adjudication of bankruptcy matters. And one exceptionalist criticism of that system is that bankruptcy courts issue judgments untethered from constitutional limitations on their power.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn50" href="#fn50"><sup>50</sup></a> Bankruptcy judges are not âArticle IIIâ judges,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn51" href="#fn51"><sup>51</sup></a> but they are adjudicating disputes over private rights that arguably fall under the exclusive judgment power of Article III and state courts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn52" href="#fn52"><sup>52</sup></a> This argument rests on a view that the Constitution protects property and liberty interests by making Article III judges, who have lifetime tenure and salary protections, available to adjudicate private disputes among individual litigants.</p><p> By this reasoning, constitutional protections are lost when non-Article III bankruptcy courts adjudicate controversies involving private rights. The argument implies bankruptcy courts should be courts of <i>extremely</i> limited jurisdiction. What is exceptional is not the power they exercise, but the fact that a non-Article III court is exercising that power. That is, when bankruptcy judges exercise equitable powersâeven those based on the text of the Bankruptcy Codeâa constitutional exceptionalist would argue they must be reined in to protect the structure created by Article III. Perhaps the bankruptcy system, by granting appellate authority to district courts, is immune to some versions of this critique, but a very strong commitment to Article III exceptionalism might perceive even that to be insufficient.</p><p> As a practical matter, we think that critique overstates things. Bankruptcy courts are subject to appellate review, which should alleviate structural concerns, at least if one accepts the appellate model of judicial review.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn53" href="#fn53"><sup>53</sup></a> And, as a formal matter, the powers created by the Bankruptcy Code are ultimately vested in Article III district courts, which have jurisdiction over bankruptcy and related matters.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn54" href="#fn54"><sup>54</sup></a> While the district courts do (as a matter of course) refer bankruptcy cases to bankruptcy judges in their districts,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn55" href="#fn55"><sup>55</sup></a> they always retain the power of appellate review<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn56" href="#fn56"><sup>56</sup></a> and can withdraw the reference to take a case back.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn57" href="#fn57"><sup>57</sup></a> Thus, although bankruptcy courts are the courts of first instance for virtually all bankruptcy cases, they exercise that power as adjuncts to, and subject to the discretion of, an Article III district court judge.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn58" href="#fn58"><sup>58</sup></a></p><p> 3. <i>Due Process</i>. A final constitutional challenge is that bankruptcy courts fail to protect due process rights. Because bankruptcy courts are resolving private rights disputes outside of the direct control of Article III there is a risk of depriving parties of their right to a jury, forcing parties to give up choice of law rights, or coercing premature settlements. According to those who hold this view, bankruptcy lawâs pursuit of judicial efficiency is in tension with due process values. While we are skeptical of such due process argumentsâfor reasons set forth elsewhere<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn59" href="#fn59"><sup>59</sup></a>âthey do reflect a recurring concern about the constitutionality of certain bankruptcy practices.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn60" href="#fn60"><sup>60</sup></a></p></div></div><div class="section" id="sc2"><div id="ac_i4" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i4">II.Â  Exceptionalism in the Courts</h2><p> Courts have occasionally echoed these concerns about bankruptcy exceptionalism, often cabining bankruptcy court power on formalist grounds. Until recently, this formalism reflected a structural commitment to the special place of Article III courts.</p><div class="section" id="sc2.1"><div id="ac_i5" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i5">A.Â  Historically</h3><p> Throughout the twentieth century, judicial review of bankruptcy exceptionalism tracked the constitutional concerns described in the previous Part. The Supreme Court sometimes limited bankruptcy authority and sometimes accommodated broad discretion, but when the Court worried that bankruptcy practice did not provide sufficient due process or Article III review, it considered the constitutionality of the practice head on and issued a constitutional ruling.</p><p> The most direct challenge to the constitutionality of bankruptcy courts came in the early 1980s, in <i>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.</i>, which involved the power to adjudicate contract disputes.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn61" href="#fn61"><sup>61</sup></a> A divided court announced that bankruptcy courts did not have that power. It was relevant to the Justices deciding <i>Northern Pipeline</i> that bankruptcy courts were neither territorial courts nor military courts-martial and that the case in question was not a public rights dispute.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn62" href="#fn62"><sup>62</sup></a> As a result, bankruptcy courts did not, according to Justice Brennanâs plurality decision, fall within any of the historic exceptions to the requirements of Article III.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn63" href="#fn63"><sup>63</sup></a></p><p> The <i>Northern Pipeline</i> decision led to the passage of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 (BAFJA), which made bankruptcy judges âa unit of the district court.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn64" href="#fn64"><sup>64</sup></a> BAFJA seemingly endorsed the appellate review model in which non-Article III courts can be allowed to adjudicate private disputes if certain âjurisdictionalâ facts are subject to de novo review in an Article III court.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn65" href="#fn65"><sup>65</sup></a></p><p> To the extent that criticisms of bankruptcy exceptionalism are aimed at bankruptcy courts (a) deciding private rights disputes and (b) lacking Article III status, it is worth noting that members of the Supreme Court personally contributed to making bankruptcy courts exceptional in this way. In the early 1980s, Congress considered two reforms to respond to the <i>Northern Pipeline</i> decision. One would have afforded bankruptcy judges Article III status.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn66" href="#fn66"><sup>66</sup></a> The other proposed to give jurisdiction to district court judges who were given authority to refer cases to bankruptcy judges.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn67" href="#fn67"><sup>67</sup></a> Chief Justice Warren Burger lobbied against the first proposal arguing it âwould dilute the prestige and quality of the Federal judiciary.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn68" href="#fn68"><sup>68</sup></a> Thus, if bankruptcy courts are exceptional when they exercise powers that properly belong to Article III courts, that is at least partially the fault of a Supreme Court Justice who was worried about degrading the status and prestige of non-bankruptcy Article III courts.</p><p> After <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, the next major case to address the constitutionality of bankruptcy courts was not about bankruptcy at all. It was instead about the constitutionality of adjudication by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Even so, the case, <i>CFTC v. Schor</i>,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn69" href="#fn69"><sup>69</sup></a> was widely understood to implicate the same Article III issue that had been raised four years earlier in <i>Northern Pipeline</i>. In <i>Schor</i>, the Supreme Court held that the CFTC had authority to adjudicate the kinds of private law disputes that <i>Northern Pipeline</i> had held unconstitutional.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn70" href="#fn70"><sup>70</sup></a> Crucially, however, the Court pointed out that parties had consented to adjudication by the CFTC:<div class="quote"><p> Congress gave the CFTC the authority to adjudicate such matters, but the decision to invoke this forum is left entirely to the parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction of these matters is unaffected. In such circumstances, separation of powers concerns are diminished, for it seems self-evident that just as Congress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of court or resort to arbitration without impermissible incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through which willing parties may, at their option, elect to resolve their differences.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn71" href="#fn71"><sup>71</sup></a></p></div>Read together, <i>Northern Pipeline</i> and <i>Schor</i> create the impression that Article III courts must be available to hear certain private rights disputes, though the <i>Schor</i> Court carved out an exception when parties consent to a non-Article III adjudicatory forum.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn72" href="#fn72"><sup>72</sup></a></p><p> Over the next thirty years, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of bankruptcy court adjudication on a few more occasions. For example, in 1989, in <i>Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg</i>, the Court held that the Seventh Amendment guaranteed the right to a jury trial for fraudulent transfer claims even though Congress had designated such claims as âcoreâ proceedings triable by a bankruptcy judge without a jury.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn73" href="#fn73"><sup>73</sup></a> As in <i>Purdue</i>, the Court recognized that the constitutional right could âimpede swift resolution of bankruptcy proceedings and increase the expense of Chapter 11 reorganizations.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn74" href="#fn74"><sup>74</sup></a> But these practical considerations were âinsufficient to overcome the Seventh Amendmentâs clear command.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn75" href="#fn75"><sup>75</sup></a> Then, in 2011, in <i>Stern v. Marshall</i>, the Court ruled that bankruptcy courts could not issue final judgments involving state law counterclaims.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn76" href="#fn76"><sup>76</sup></a> Once again, the statutory designation of such claims as âcoreâ was irrelevant to the constitutional analysis.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn77" href="#fn77"><sup>77</sup></a> The Court later tempered this ruling when it announced that the Constitution could tolerate bankruptcy court judgments over private rights when those judgments are subject to de novo review by an Article III court.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn78" href="#fn78"><sup>78</sup></a></p><p> But the formal doctrine that emerged between 1982 and 2011 paints only a partial picture of bankruptcy practice in that period. Despite occasionally striking down bankruptcy court judgments on constitutional grounds, for decades the Supreme Court and courts of appeals tolerated broad exercises of bankruptcy court authorityâeither by reading the language of the Code broadly or by not reviewing bankruptcy court decisions.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn79" href="#fn79"><sup>79</sup></a> To that end, courts tolerated bankruptcy court innovations that allowed bankruptcy judges to blur corporate formalities,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn80" href="#fn80"><sup>80</sup></a> order nonconsensual third-party releases,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn81" href="#fn81"><sup>81</sup></a> dismiss cases for being filed in bad faith,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn82" href="#fn82"><sup>82</sup></a> and approve settlements that might deviate from the strict requirements of absolute priority.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn83" href="#fn83"><sup>83</sup></a> These innovations occurred quietly as district and circuit courts tolerated bankruptcy court discretion based on the broad language of the Code, and they did so while largely leaving due process and Article III concerns unaddressed.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc2.2"><div id="ac_i6" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i6">B.Â  <i>Purdue</i> and the Constitutionality of Bankruptcy Courts</h3><p> Recently, however, the Supreme Court has begun to avoid constitutional decisions in bankruptcy cases, opting instead to narrowly construe the text of the Code.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn84" href="#fn84"><sup>84</sup></a> Our reading of <i>Purdue</i> suggests this is part of a trend of reading broad provisions of the Bankruptcy Code narrowly to avoid constitutional questions about court structure. Though the courts never explicitly say so, they have adopted something like a canonâseemingly rooted in notions of due process and structural separation of powers concernsâof narrowing the Codeâs text.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn85" href="#fn85"><sup>85</sup></a></p><p> The majority in <i>Purdue</i> provided a purely statutory explanation for its decision. It argued that nearby text in the Codeâfound in Sections 1123(b)(1)â(5)âauthorizes only specific plan provisions dealing with claims held by the debtor. And so, Justice Gorsuch wrote for the majority, âother appropriate provisionsâ must be similarly limited to provisions directly relating to claims and property of the debtor.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn86" href="#fn86"><sup>86</sup></a> The dissent, by contrast, felt the textâs plain meaningâparticularly, the fact that Section 1123(b)(6) allows the inclusion of any âappropriate provision not inconsistentâ with other provisions of the Code<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn87" href="#fn87"><sup>87</sup></a>âgives courts presiding over Chapter 11 proceedings discretion to approve plan provisions that are necessary to resolve complex issues that arise when firms are in financial distress.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn88" href="#fn88"><sup>88</sup></a></p><p> By our reading, however, non-textual concerns were the driving force behind the majorityâs decision. Like the cases described in the previous Section, the majority in <i>Purdue</i> expressed a concern about structural issues that could be posed by third-party releases. The structural concerns stand out when the Court expresses unease about a âroving commission,â and when it frames the question before it as one about the authority of bankruptcy courts rather than addressing the actual question before it, which dealt with the power of an <i>Article III court presiding over a bankruptcy case</i>.</p><p> In fact, one of the most notable parts of <i>Purdue</i> is that the case satisfied the Article III requirements the Supreme Court had established a decade earlier. As a formal matter, the bankruptcy court order had been subject to and ultimately approved under de novo review in an Article III court (here, the Second Circuit).<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn89" href="#fn89"><sup>89</sup></a> The case thus came to the Court as one not about the power of a bankruptcy court but about the power of an Article III court hearing a bankruptcy case to approve third-party releases. No direct constitutional claims were even raised on appeal.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn90" href="#fn90"><sup>90</sup></a></p><p> Yet, the Supreme Court felt compelled to hold that the <i>bankruptcy court</i> had gone too far in resolving claims against third parties. At one point, the majority announced that âa bankruptcy courtâs powers are not limitless.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn91" href="#fn91"><sup>91</sup></a> But no one had argued that they were.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn92" href="#fn92"><sup>92</sup></a> Again, the case was about whether the Second Circuit was endowed with the power to approve third-party releases after a de novo review.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn93" href="#fn93"><sup>93</sup></a></p><p> Driving the point home, although the Court claimed it was engaging in ordinary statutory interpretation, the majority opinion contains a number of passages that would fit comfortably with constitutional arguments from earlier decades. For example, the majority emphasized that the third parties in <i>Purdue</i> <a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn94" href="#fn94"><sup>94</sup></a> were âseek[ing] an injunction âpermanently and foreverâ foreclosing similar suits in the future. And they seek all this without the consent of those affected.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn95" href="#fn95"><sup>95</sup></a> Later, the majority appears to invoke due process values by claiming that Purdueâs theory of nonconsensual third-party releases âsuggests those claims can be bargained away without the consent of those affected, as if the claims were somehow Purdueâs own property.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn96" href="#fn96"><sup>96</sup></a></p><p> Perhaps most importantly, the majority opinion suggested that a broad theory of Section 1123(b)(6) would have been inconsistent with the history and tradition of the judicial power:<div class="quote"><p> No one has directed us to a statute or case suggesting American courts in the past enjoyed the power in bankruptcy to discharge claims brought by nondebtors against other nondebtors, all without the consent of those affected. Surely, if Congress had meant to reshape traditional practice so profoundly in the present bankruptcy code, extending to courts the capacious new power the plan proponents claim, one might have expected it to say so expressly âsomewhere in the [c]ode itself.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn97" href="#fn97"><sup>97</sup></a></p></div></p><p> These quotes are all framed as reasons to adopt a narrow understanding of Section 1123(b)(6), but they resemble the structural arguments that had for decades persuaded the Supreme Court to constitutionally limit bankruptcy courtsâ judgment power. For example, in pointing out that nonconsensual third-party releases would give Purdue a property right in plaintiffsâ claims, the majority hintsâwithout saying so outrightâthat nonconsensual third-party releases would amount to an unconstitutional taking, or at least that they would raise property-rights concerns. Similarly, concerns about ârovingâ and âlimitlessâ bankruptcy court powers resemble concerns that bankruptcy courts are exercising Article III powers. And the resort to history and tradition suggests that Congress needs to provide a clearâin our view, impossibly clear<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn98" href="#fn98"><sup>98</sup></a>âstatement if it wants to âreshape traditional practiceâ by expanding bankruptcy court powers to include the right to order nonconsensual third-party releases. Those concerns all appear to have been on the minds of the Justices and likely influenced the Courtâs interpretation of the text of the Bankruptcy Code.</p><p> Because the Court did not explicitly base its ultimate decision on these concerns, we cannot prove the constitutional matters were the primary driver for the Courtâs decision. After all, the Court never says it is engaged in constitutional avoidance. But on our read, the opinionâwith its asides about structure and history and tradition, its references to the authority of the bankruptcy court, and its forced rendering of the <i>ejusdem generis</i> interpretive principle<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn99" href="#fn99"><sup>99</sup></a>âreveals a driving concern that nonconsensual third-party releases would curtail plaintiffsâ property rights and assign Article III powers to non-Article III courts.</p><p> <i>Purdue</i> is the clearest and most important example to date in which the Supreme Court interpreted the Bankruptcy Code narrowly to limit the powers of non-Article III judges and to mitigate perceived constitutional infirmities. But it is not the only instance in which the Court has voiced a concern about the scope of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, in <i>Mission Products Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC</i>, a case about the right to reject intellectual property licenses in bankruptcy, the Supreme Court observed: âThe Code of course aims to make reorganizations possible. But it does not permit anything and everything that might advance that goal.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn100" href="#fn100"><sup>100</sup></a> In <i>Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp.</i>, the Court rejected a procedural maneuver, known as a âstructured dismissal,â that was used to circumvent the Codeâs absolute priority requirement.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn101" href="#fn101"><sup>101</sup></a> While the holding of the case was narrow, the Courtâs opinion noted: âThe importance of the priority system leads us to expect more than simple statutory silence if, and when, Congress were to intend a major departure.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn102" href="#fn102"><sup>102</sup></a> Some lower courts have read this statement to create a clear-statement requirement for interpreting Code provisions that might conflict with absolute priority.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn103" href="#fn103"><sup>103</sup></a> Other lower courts have taken <i>Jevic</i> even further, inferring a general policy against bankruptcy court gap-filling.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn104" href="#fn104"><sup>104</sup></a> Finally, <i>Jevic</i> itself built on an earlier case, <i>Law v. Siegel</i>, where the Court also made a point of noting that statutory silence âdoes not give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions based on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn105" href="#fn105"><sup>105</sup></a></p><p> None of these cases directly confronted a constitutional challenge to any particular bankruptcy practice. Nor did they state explicitly that they were limiting bankruptcy court authority to correct a constitutional infirmity in the U.S. bankruptcy system. Nonetheless, in each case, the Court went out of its way to express its concern that bankruptcy courts were exercising too much authority. And in each one, the Court suggestedâas have the scholarly critics of bankruptcy exceptionalismâthat such authority is inconsistent with rule of law principles.</p><p> In that respect, the bankruptcy cases before the Court are consistent with a new bankruptcy exceptionalism where the Courtâconcerned about proper judicial authorityâreads broad grants of authority in the Bankruptcy Code more narrowly than it might elsewhere. For example, as noted above, the Court has taken a much different approach in dealing with broad grants of discretion that run directly and exclusively to Article III courts.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn106" href="#fn106"><sup>106</sup></a></p><p> <i>* * *</i></p><p> So does <i>Purdue</i> create or curtail exceptionalism? The question is partly semantic, and the answer depends on how one defines bankruptcy exceptionalism. If bankruptcy exceptionalism means that it is exceptional for non-Article III courts to adjudicate disputes that ordinarily fall under the authority of Article III courts, then <i>Purdue</i> indirectly limits bankruptcy exceptionalism by announcing a limitation on all courts hearing bankruptcy cases. The non-exceptional approach would be for Article III or state courts to adjudicate private disputes among individuals. <i>Purdue</i> has ensured that a swath of those cases will never be resolved before a bankruptcy judge. One can debate whether this is a good outcome. We think it is not.</p><p> Besides the merits of which forum should adjudicate these cases, the majorityâs interpretive approach also introduces significant uncertainty for bankruptcy courts and practitioners. Instead of confronting the Article III question directly, the Court invented a new kind of bankruptcy exceptionalism by distorting the substantive provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to sidestep underlying procedural concerns about the structural design of the bankruptcy courts. While this constitutional avoidance may have facilitated agreement among a majority of the Court, it has already bred confusion and inconsistency in the lower courts. It is to that problem that we now turn.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sc3"><div id="ac_i7" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i7">III. <i>Purdue</i>âs Effect on Substantive Bankruptcy Law and Practice</h2><p> Many bankruptcy practices exist because judges and lawyers responded creatively to changes in capital markets. Given how little guidance the text itself provides, and how much uncertainty there is about the new structural canon of bankruptcy interpretation, an enormous number of bankruptcy doctrines are vulnerable to Supreme Court reversal. We do not believe the Court will reverse every practice, but the lack of a limiting principle in <i>Purdue</i> could be just as harmful, since corporations and bankruptcy attorneys have little guidance about which bankruptcy principles remain acceptable and which do not. Ironically, then, the Courtâs attempt to constrain bankruptcy judges will incentivize unruly and strategic approaches by judges and practitioners. The following Sections provide specific examples of how <i>Purdue</i> threatens future bankruptcy cases in distinct ways.</p><div class="section" id="sc3.1"><div id="ac_i8" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i8">A. Mass Tort Settlements in Bankruptcy</h3><p> Most obviously, <i>Purdue</i> will change the landscape for settling mass torts in bankruptcy. The <i>Purdue</i> Court identified a list of issues upon which it did not pass judgment. These included <i>consensual</i> third-party releases, plans that provide for full satisfaction of claims against a third-party nondebtor, and substantially consummated plans.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn107" href="#fn107"><sup>107</sup></a> The dissent was skeptical that these and other practices could survive the majority opinion, and they are now live issues in the lower courts.</p><p> 1. Purdue <i>ItselfâPreliminary Injunctions and Other Mass Tort Workarounds</i>. The Courtâs ruling in <i>Purdue</i> did not end settlement discussions in that case. After the opinion was issued, the bankruptcy judge extended the injunctions against nondebtor litigation to try to secure a global settlement. Across the board, bankruptcy courts have been quick to affirm their power to temporarily enjoin nondebtor litigation during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings. But the test for granting those injunctions has changed. As one judge explained:<div class="quote"><p> Accordingly, to the extent a debtor sought to justify a preliminary injunction on the notion that it was likely to succeed on the merits by ultimately obtaining a third-party release, such an argument would now need to fail in light of <i>Purdue Pharma</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn108" href="#fn108"><sup>108</sup></a></p></div>At the same time, the court explained that preliminary injunctions of third-party claims are still âappropriate where the assertion of those claims would interfere with the debtorâs reorganization efforts.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn109" href="#fn109"><sup>109</sup></a></p><p> And that is how <i>Purdue</i> has proceeded. Litigation against the Sacklers is still enjoined while the parties continue to negotiate toward a near-global settlement. Reports and court filings suggest they are close to a deal. But the parties have had to add creative mechanisms to protect against the risk of holdouts. According to one report, while the Sacklers have increased their settlement offer by $500 million, they have also added a condition requiring the claimants âto set aside as much as $800 million in an account akin to a legal-defense fund for the billionaires to fight such cases [brought by the hold outs].â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn110" href="#fn110"><sup>110</sup></a></p><p> This structure is still subject to judicial approval and plan voting, but it provides a glimpse of the workarounds that might be attempted if mass tort cases are to be settled without nonconsensual releases in bankruptcy court.</p><p> 2. Boy Scouts of America<i>âEquitable Mootness and Full Satisfaction.</i> In its concluding paragraph in <i>Purdue</i>, the Court noted the following:<div class="quote"><p> Nor do we have occasion today to express a view on what qualifies as a consensual release or pass upon a plan that provides for the full satisfaction of claims against a third-party nondebtor. Additionally, because this case involves only a stayed reorganization plan, we do not address whether our reading of the bankruptcy code would justify unwinding reorganization plans that have already become effective and been substantially consummated.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn111" href="#fn111"><sup>111</sup></a></p></div>The Courtâs specific mention of full satisfaction and substantial consummation were likely included specifically with the bankruptcy of Boy Scouts of America in mind.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn112" href="#fn112"><sup>112</sup></a></p><p> The <i>Boy Scouts</i> case presents perhaps the most compelling case for nonconsensual third-party releases. The bankruptcy resulted from over eighty thousand claims of sexual abuse brought against the Boys Scouts of America and tens of thousands of its affiliates.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn113" href="#fn113"><sup>113</sup></a> The plan of reorganization in that case created a multi-billion-dollar settlement trust for victims funded by contributions from thousands of entities including the Boy Scouts of America, local Boy Scouts councils, chartered organizations (which operated or sponsored local Boy Scouts programs and include small and large churches and charitable organizations), and insurers of those parties.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn114" href="#fn114"><sup>114</sup></a> To facilitate this settlement the plan included broad releases for these participating parties. Notably, and in contrast to the <i>Purdue</i> case, the releases in the <i>Boy Scouts</i> case do not include any individual who directly committed (or was alleged to have committed) an act of abuse.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn115" href="#fn115"><sup>115</sup></a></p><p> The Boy Scoutsâ plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court and now sits under consideration before the Third Circuit.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn116" href="#fn116"><sup>116</sup></a> Opponents of the plan argue it should be rejected under the reasoning of <i>Purdue</i> because local councils, chartering organizations, and insurers are receiving nonconsensual nondebtor releases.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn117" href="#fn117"><sup>117</sup></a></p><p> But proponents of the plan make two arguments for why it should survive the <i>Purdue</i> decision. First, at the time of the <i>Purdue</i> decision, the Boy Scoutsâ plan was already confirmed and had been making payouts to victims for over a year. Thus, they argue, it was âsubstantially consummated,â and the case is âequitably moot.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn118" href="#fn118"><sup>118</sup></a> Because the <i>Purdue</i> Court specifically declined to opine on substantial consummation, one might expect the Third Circuit to affirm the case, drawing some comfort that the Supreme Court will not step in to reverse.</p><p> That said, there is considerable disagreement among judges about the notion that a bankruptcy case becomes immune to appellate review simply because there are limits to the available relief upon reversal. We do not expect equitable mootness to be a long-lived doctrine. Unlike third-party releases, it is actually a doctrine unmoored from statutory authority, which is likely to offend the Courtâs sense of textualism. On top of that, it is a judge-made doctrine that shields bankruptcy judges from Article III review.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn119" href="#fn119"><sup>119</sup></a> If our analysis above is correct, that is exactly the kind of doctrine that keeps formalist Justices up at night. Indeed, one Third Circuit judgeâwho currently sits on the panel for the <i>Boy Scouts</i> caseâhas criticized the equitable mootness doctrine several times, labelling it âlegally ungrounded and practically unadministrable.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn120" href="#fn120"><sup>120</sup></a></p><p> The proponents of the plan in the <i>Boys Scouts</i> case might have two additional arrows in their quiver. First, Section 363(m) of the Code specifically protects certain asset sales from appellate review after they have been consummated.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn121" href="#fn121"><sup>121</sup></a> The <i>Boy Scouts</i> settlement plan included the sale of insurance policies back to insurers for almost $1.6 billion free and clear of any claims against the policies<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn122" href="#fn122"><sup>122</sup></a> as part of the release structure.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn123" href="#fn123"><sup>123</sup></a> These sales were bound up with the entire plan and the releases of other nondebtor entities and co-insured parties. A court might read Section 363(m) as protecting a consummated sale <i>and all intertwined transactions</i> from appellate review. As one might expect, the partiesâ briefs very in their views about how intertwined the sales are with other transactions.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn124" href="#fn124"><sup>124</sup></a></p><p> Finally, there is the argument about full-satisfaction plans, which proponents of the <i>Boy Scouts</i> settlement plan have leaned on before the Third Circuit.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn125" href="#fn125"><sup>125</sup></a> The concept is simple. If a claimant is paid the full amount it is owed by the third-party nondebtor, then there is nothing left to argue about, and the release cannot harm anyone. The full-satisfaction doctrine is most intuitive in an insurer or joint tortfeasor context. A victim who suffered $1 million in damages may be entitled to recover $1 million from either the debtor or a third party or both. But the victim is not entitled to recover <i>more</i> than $1 million in damages just because there might be two possible defendants. If the victim attempted to bring suit after fully recovering, the prior recovery would be a defense, and the case would be dismissed. And so, some courts have said that a bankruptcy court can release the victimsâ claims against the nondebtor when the debtorâs estate is providing full satisfaction of the claim (here, $1 million).</p><p> But implementation of the doctrine is fraught. Set aside future claimants, where the full-satisfaction doctrine is meaningless, and one still must figure out who decides what counts as full satisfaction. At the time of a mass tort settlement, most victims have not had their individual claims litigated. The court does not know the amount of a particular objecting victimâs claim against the nondebtor (or against the debtor for that matter).</p><p> What does it mean then to say that the claim against the nondebtor is fully satisfied by the settlement trust? This question has two components. First, how much is owed to the victim, and second, when will the money be made available to the victims? In the <i>Boy Scouts</i> case, the judge made a detailed factual finding based on expert testimony to the effect that there would be enough money in the settlement trust to pay all claims in full. This is essentially a statistical finding that all potential liabilities will likely be covered, but it is far from a certainty.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn126" href="#fn126"><sup>126</sup></a></p><p> As a practical matter, we think this method of achieving settlement promotes the public interest. But it is hard to see how it survives the holding in <i>Purdue</i>. The bankruptcy judge in <i>Purdue</i>, subject to review by the Second Circuit, made a factual determination that the victims would be worse off without the proposed settlement containing releases. The Supreme Court seems to have said that is insufficient to justify binding the holdouts. Things may be different, the Court says, when the bankruptcy court makes a factual finding that the settlement fully compensates victims. But what if the victims disagree? Under what statutory authority can they be bound?<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn127" href="#fn127"><sup>127</sup></a></p><p> As Justice Kavanaugh noted in his dissent:<div class="quote"><p> Again, the only provision that could possibly supply authority to include those full-satisfaction releases in a bankruptcy plan is the catchall in Â§ 1123(b)(6). Any contract-law theory would not work for full-satisfaction releases, given that holdout creditors often refuse to consent to full-satisfaction releases. So if full-satisfaction releases are to be allowed, Â§ 1123(b)(6) must be read to reach creditor claims against non-debtors, even without consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn128" href="#fn128"><sup>128</sup></a></p></div>But that is exactly what the <i>Purdue</i> majority rejected.</p><p> One version of the full-satisfaction doctrine that might survive post-<i>Purdue</i> scrutiny would be for courts to allow channeling injunctions that require victims to bring cases against the fund until and unless the fund runs out of money. Such injunctions could be considered in aid of a rule that a tort victim is only entitled to one satisfaction<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn129" href="#fn129"><sup>129</sup></a> but would not bind victims to a release that may result in less than full payment. This would be consistent with the courtâs authority to enter injunctions either under Section 105(a)âs grant of power necessary to enforce a plan or the All Writs Actâs grant of authority in aid of a courtâs jurisdiction.</p><p> Such releases would become ineffective if, years down the road, the fund ran out of money. It is not clear whether debtors would get behind that version of releases. On the one hand, if the funds truly are providing full satisfaction, the possibility of the fund running out should be negligible. On the other hand, the entire point of the releases is to provide finality in aid of settlement. Precisely because the number and magnitude of future claims is unknown and plagued by variance, the tail risk is high.</p><p> In the end, we suspect that the <i>Boy Scouts</i> settlement plan will survive. The Third Circuit will likely affirm the confirmation of the plan pointing to some or all the grounds discussed, and the Supreme Court will sit this one out. This is good news for the victims waiting for their recoveries, but the full-satisfaction doctrine seems unlikely to be the hook to justify future mass tort settlements. This uncertainty is bad news for victims in similar bankruptcy cases that are pending or yet to be filed, such as those involving sexual abuse allegations in dozens of Catholic Church dioceses.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn130" href="#fn130"><sup>130</sup></a></p></div><div class="section" id="sc3.2"><div id="ac_i9" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i9">B. Consensual ReleasesâOpt-In or Opt-Out?</h3><p> During oral argument in <i>Purdue</i>, Justice Thomas repeatedly questioned whether the validity of consensual releases and nonconsensual releases were inextricably linked.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn131" href="#fn131"><sup>131</sup></a> Justice Kavanaughâs dissent suggested they are. Noting that there was no other provision in the Code allowing for releases, he concluded that âthe only provision that could possibly supply authority to include those [consensual] releases in the bankruptcy plan is the catchall in Â§ 1123(b)(6).â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn132" href="#fn132"><sup>132</sup></a></p><p> The Court explicitly declined to answer the question, noting only that such releases âmay rest on different legal grounds.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn133" href="#fn133"><sup>133</sup></a> The problem is difficult because a consensual nondebtor release included in a bankruptcy plan is more than a private settlement contract. With a consensual release, a debtor is putting the release provision into a bankruptcy plan that is disclosed to and voted on by its creditors, asking the court to approve that plan, and essentially asking for a preemptive federal court order enforcing the terms of the release. The debtor may even condition approval of the plan upon reaching a certain threshold of consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn134" href="#fn134"><sup>134</sup></a> Because this is all tied up in the Chapter 11 plan-confirmation process, the authority for such releases would lie in a provision of bankruptcy law, as opposed to state contract law.</p><p> Lower courts have unsurprisingly fractured in their post-<i>Purdue</i> approach to consensual releases. While no court has yet held consensual releases to be entirely off-limits, several courts have limited the means by which consent can be registered. The issue comes up most frequently in deciding whether consent can be achieved through opt-in or opt-out provisions. The bankruptcy courts have varied in their approaches to this issue. For example, one bankruptcy judge in Delaware explained, â[a]fter <i>Purdue Pharma</i>, a third-party release is no longer an ordinary plan provision that can properly be entered by âdefaultâ in the absence of an objection.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn135" href="#fn135"><sup>135</sup></a> The judge likened opt-out consent provisions in a plan to leaving a letter on a carâs windshield stating that a failure to respond within ten days constitutes consent to a contract. He concluded: â[A] creditor cannot be deemed to consent to a third-party release without some affirmative expression of the creditorâs consent.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn136" href="#fn136"><sup>136</sup></a> That affirmative expression might take the form of a vote for a plan or some other form of opting in. Another bankruptcy judge in Delaware approved opt-out consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn137" href="#fn137"><sup>137</sup></a></p><p> In New York, one bankruptcy judge looked to state contract law to require affirmative written consent from each claimholder.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn138" href="#fn138"><sup>138</sup></a> One invoked Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 to allow opt-out consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn139" href="#fn139"><sup>139</sup></a> Another allowed opt-out releases where notice was robust and the circumstances suggested that the failure to opt-out was a meaningful signal of consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn140" href="#fn140"><sup>140</sup></a> In the Southern District of Texas, one bankruptcy judge reasoned that because the <i>Purdue</i> court explicitly declined to address consensual releases, he was bound only by local pre-<i>Purdue</i> precedent on what constituted consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn141" href="#fn141"><sup>141</sup></a></p><p> Of course, if we are right that the Court is driven by broader structural concerns, then perhaps the Court will find in the text a path to approving consensual releases (even those with opt-out consent). After all, in prior cases like <i>Wellness International Network v. Sharif</i> and <i>Schor</i>, the Court has already indicated that its structural concerns are greatly reduced when the parties consent.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn142" href="#fn142"><sup>142</sup></a> But here, again, the Courtâs methodological approach introduces a great deal of uncertainty. Because it did not directly identify structure as the basis for its holding, practitioners are left to anticipate how the new bankruptcy exceptionalism will operate in future cases. And the lower courts are supposed to apply the holding of the caseânot our view of its motivation.</p></div><div class="section" id="sc3.3"><div id="ac_i10" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i10">C. Chapter 15</h3><p> One area of bankruptcy practice that has become increasingly important was not mentioned in the <i>Purdue</i> opinion: cross-border proceedings. When a debtor has assets in multiple jurisdictions, there are complicated procedures involved in coordinating insolvency proceedings. A debtor might initiate its main insolvency proceedings in Hong Kong or the United Kingdom and then seek to enforce the results of those proceedings with regard to assets or creditors in the United States. The legal mechanism for so doing is recognition and enforcement of the foreign proceedings under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p><p> But what if the foreign proceedings include nonconsensual nondebtor releases? Those releases are common in other jurisdictions. They are granted broadly in the United Kingdom, under certain circumstances in Hong Kong, and at least with respect to affiliate entities in many European jurisdictions. U.S. bankruptcy courts have routinely recognized foreign proceedings including third-party releases even when those exact releases would not have been available under Chapter 11.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn143" href="#fn143"><sup>143</sup></a></p><p> <i>Purdue</i> should change none of that. The principles of comity and foreign recognition that undergird Chapter 15 counsel courts to recognize and enforce foreign proceedings as long as the creditors received a âfull and fair opportunity to be heard in a manner consistent with U.S. due process standards.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn144" href="#fn144"><sup>144</sup></a> Nonrecognition is reserved for cases where the foreign proceedings are âmanifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn145" href="#fn145"><sup>145</sup></a></p><p> It would be surprising for a court to hold that nonconsensual nondebtor releases were manifestly against the public policy of the United States. While the Court struck down the use of nonconsensual releases, it never suggested that they were fundamentally at odds with public policy. Even after <i>Purdue</i>, nonconsensual third-party releases are still available in cases involving asbestos (under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code), and the Court made a point of noting that âCongress may choose to add to the bankruptcy code special rules for opioid-related bankruptcies as it has for asbestos-related cases.â<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn146" href="#fn146"><sup>146</sup></a> In the wake of <i>Purdue</i>, several courts have already recognized foreign proceedings with nonconsensual releases, holding they were not contrary to public policy.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn147" href="#fn147"><sup>147</sup></a></p><p> And yet, the Office of the United States Trustee has come out strongly on this issue, already challenging the Chapter 15 recognition of a Hong Kong proceeding on the ground that after <i>Purdue</i> all nonconsensual nondebtor releases are contrary to the public policy of the United States. The Trustee argued:<div class="quote"><p> [T]he relief requested is âmanifestly contrary to public policyâ because third-party releases may not be imposed without consent through a bankruptcy plan under United States law. <i>Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, L.P.</i>, 603 U.S. ___, 144 S. Ct. 2071 (2024). Accordingly, the Court cannot grant comity and enforce the nonconsensual third-party releases issued through a scheme in the Hong Kong Proceeding.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn148" href="#fn148"><sup>148</sup></a></p></div></p><p> The Trusteeâs choice to object in this particular case is surprising since the releases in question are fairly run-of-the mill, involving inter-company guaranties of a Chinese property developer (as opposed to tort claims arising out of operations in the United States). With those facts, the case is likely to result in a bankruptcy court opinion supporting the recognition of foreign proceedings with nondebtor releases.</p><p> The Trustee also appears to be indifferent to the necessity of such releases in other global jurisdictions where nondebtor releases are essential to coordinating insolvency proceedings that involve multi-entity debtors. Most large business are made up of several legal entities. Thus, the enterprise includes a parent entity and many subsidiaries. The parent and subsidiaries might be liable on the same debt.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn149" href="#fn149"><sup>149</sup></a> It is difficult in those situations to resolve the liabilities of one entity without resolving the liabilities of the others. In the United States, this problem can be solved by bringing the bankruptcy cases for all of the affiliates into one proceeding. This âadministrative consolidationâ allows all the cases to be heard before the same judge. When it comes time to approve releases, all of the entities are debtors, and some courts even let the parties vote on one plan that covers the whole enterprise.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn150" href="#fn150"><sup>150</sup></a> The upshot is that there are no ânondebtors.â</p><p> That procedural mechanism is not always available in other jurisdictions, many of which would require separate proceedingsâsometimes in front of different courtsâfor each entity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn151" href="#fn151"><sup>151</sup></a> This introduces coordination problems when it comes time to vote on the final resolution of the cases. Many of those jurisdictions address the problem with nondebtor releases. They allow one anchor debtor to initiate a proceeding and then propose a resolution that includes nonconsensual nondebtor releases for affiliates.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn152" href="#fn152"><sup>152</sup></a></p><p> The bankruptcy of multi-entity debtors with cross-liabilities requires at least one of these two mechanisms (releases or administrative consolidation) to function. Blocking third-party releases in Chapter 15 could make it impossible for insolvency proceedings from jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany to be effectively enforced in the United States.</p><p> Down the road, precedent allowing recognition is likely to form the foundation of a more radical maneuver when <i>United States</i>-based companies seeking nondebtor releases take their insolvency cases to another country. As we have explained in other work, there is little stopping a U.S. debtor from initiating insolvency proceedings abroad and then using Chapter 15 to enforce those proceedings in the United States. For this strategy to work, the debtor needs two things: 1) a welcoming jurisdictionâlike the United Kingdomâthat permits insolvency forum shopping and views nondebtor releases favorably;<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn153" href="#fn153"><sup>153</sup></a> and 2) post-<i>Purdue</i> Chapter 15 precedent recognizing and enforcing foreign plans with nondebtor releases. The Trusteeâs objection in <i>Yuzhou Group Holdings Co.</i> is likely to produce the latter.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn154" href="#fn154"><sup>154</sup></a></p></div><div class="section" id="sc3.4"><div id="ac_i11" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h3 class="article-section__title" id="_i11">D. What Lies Ahead?</h3><p> The list of practices drawn into question by <i>Purdue</i> is seemingly endless. For example, bankruptcy courts regularly grant exculpations to protect the debtorâs agents and fiduciaries from lawsuits related to work performed during the bankruptcy. Like third-party releases, these provisions find no express authorization in the Code outside of Section 1123(b)(6). Similarly, some bankruptcy courts have taken to issuing âgatekeepingâ injunctions.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn155" href="#fn155"><sup>155</sup></a> These measures essentially require a litigant to come before the bankruptcy court asking permission to proceed with certain claims against nondebtors (usually insiders or fiduciaries). Again, there is no direct statutory provision other than Section 1123(b)(6) on point.</p><p> Doctrines like substantive consolidation, the true-sale doctrine, debt recharacterization,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn156" href="#fn156"><sup>156</sup></a> and vote designation are all on similarly shaky footing.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn157" href="#fn157"><sup>157</sup></a> As are common sense rulings that prohibit the diversion of assets to the families of insiders.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn158" href="#fn158"><sup>158</sup></a> Similarly, the procedural matter of administrative consolidation, which often allows creditors to treat large multi-entity enterprises as one for voting and other administrative purposes,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn159" href="#fn159"><sup>159</sup></a> cannot be fully justified by the plain text of the Code nor of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn160" href="#fn160"><sup>160</sup></a></p><p> Even more fundamentally, bankruptcy courts have long assumed the power to dismiss cases that were not filed in good faith. But if one reads the Code the way the majority did in <i>Purdue</i>, even this power is in doubt. Section 1112(b) of the code allows dismissal for cause. But it then provides a list of sixteen instances that would constitute âcause,â each one relating to behavior of the debtor <i>after filing</i>.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn161" href="#fn161"><sup>161</sup></a> In contrast, good faith filing deals exclusively with things that occurred up until the moment of filing. The <i>Purdue</i> Courtâs invocation of the <i>ejusdem generis</i> canon suggests then that dismissal for cause can never include lack of good faith nor any other pre-filing causes. Are bankruptcy courts that require good faith at filing operating with a roving commission?</p><p> This all leaves the bankruptcy law in a state of great uncertainty. We do not think any legislative reforms are likely to change that. Nor, however, do we suggest bankruptcy courts and lawyers will abandon all innovative practices and just close shop.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn162" href="#fn162"><sup>162</sup></a> Rather, we suspect the bankruptcy practice will start (has already started!<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn163" href="#fn163"><sup>163</sup></a>) erecting workarounds to avoid the effect of the Courtâs new bankruptcy exceptionalism. Ironically, we expect that <i>Purdue</i> will be a catalyst in creating a real and pernicious gap between the âlaw on the booksâ and the âlaw on the ground.â As Article III courts set up formalist barriers to the operation of the Code as written, the practice will be forced to adopt more evasive and contrived workarounds. Injunctions will be structured to dissuade or bind hold outs. The scope of injunctions,<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn164" href="#fn164"><sup>164</sup></a> exculpations, and gatekeeping clauses will be expanded (at least until the courts of appeal prohibit them altogether). Releases will migrate to settlements<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn165" href="#fn165"><sup>165</sup></a> and going concern sales<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn166" href="#fn166"><sup>166</sup></a> that are entered long before the plan and structured to be irreversible. Plans might be structured to accelerate mootness. Debtors will push the envelope on what counts as full satisfaction. And so on, until it is just bankruptcy exceptionalism feeding on bankruptcy exceptionalism.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sc4"><div id="ac_i12" class="anchor-spacer"></div><h2 class="article-section__title section__title" id="_i12">Conclusion</h2><p> <i>Purdue</i> is an oddity. By our reading, the Court distorted the meaning of the statutory text to jealously protect Article III power. Rather than directly rebuke Congress for allowing non-Article III courts to share Article III power, the Court has adopted a canon allowing it to ignore the statutes produced by Congress. The canon could also be viewed as an analogue to the major questions doctrine that the Court has applied to administrative agencies. Again, the oddity is in applying this doctrine to cases that are brought before Article III courts. In a sense, the Court is altering the interpretation of statute rather than directly rebuking Congress for what it views as the original sin: delegating judicial authority to a non-Article III entity.<a class="ref fn" id="xref_fn167" href="#fn167"><sup>167</sup></a> Ironically, in doing so it constrains the power of all courtsâArticle III includedâto resolve complex bankruptcy cases.

But he is an outlier. During his confirmation hearings, one of his Tenth Circuit dissenting opinions refusing to find an equitable exception to a statute was widely criticized. The caseâcommonly referred to as the âfrozen trucker caseââinvolved a truck driver who was fired for driving his employerâs truck to safety to avoid life-threatening cold. The majority of the Tenth Circuit upheld findings by the Department of Labor (DOL) and an administrative law judge (ALJ) that the termination violated a law prohibiting discharge where an employee ârefuses to operate a vehicleâ because of unsafe conditions. TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Admin. Rev. Bd., 833 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2016). Then-Judge Gorsuch dissented, explaining that the driver <i>operated</i> the vehicle and the statute only protected <i>refusal to operate</i>. He explained that neither the DOL, nor the ALJ, nor the Tenth Circuit had the power to read an exception into the statute.

The Delaware Court of Chancery, which presides over the nationâs most complex corporate and business governance cases, famously does. As a result, complex corporate issues that go before that court are decided by judges arguably exercising discretion and invoking broader remedies than their counterparts in the Delaware Superior Court, which operates as a court of law. One might argue that Delawareâs structure is âexceptionalââit is one of only three states that still maintains separate equity courtsâbut the structure is one with a long historical pedigree.</p><p> Other states have started to create specialized business courts in attempts to compete with Delaware.

But this, too, is not âexceptional.â It is a feature of any proceeding in a federal court that could otherwise have been brought in a state court of equity, such as those brought under diversity jurisdiction.</p></span><span class="NLM_fn" id="fn32"><p><a href="#xref_fn32"><sup>32</sup> </a> Samuel Bray has argued that there is still a system of equity that exists within the unified federal courts. Bray, <i>supra</i> note 23. And the distinction still controls the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury. Whether a litigant in federal court has a right to a jury turns in part on whether a case would have been brought in a court of law or equity in 1791. This vestige of the law-equity divide applies and is enforced in all federal cases, including bankruptcy cases. Notably, however, the Seventh Amendment does not apply to cases in state court. A party litigating in state court is not entitled to a jury under the Seventh Amendment even if the case arose from federal substantive law. <i>See</i> Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v.

This drafter wants plans to conform with all the requirements set forth explicitly in other provisions of the Code, especially Section 1129. But beyond that, the drafter wants to give the parties and the courts leeway. How would that drafter accomplish her objective?</p><p> Section 1123(b)(6) provides that a plan can approve any appropriate provisions not inconsistent with other provisions of the Code. That is the most direct way of achieving this hypothetical drafterâs objective. By our reading, the other items listed in Sections 1123(b)(1)â(5) are specific things that the drafters worried might be viewed by courts as inconsistent with other provisions. So they specifically listed them as allowable.</p><p> Perhaps a more adept drafter would have put Section 1123(b)(6) first to convey the point. Beyond that option, there are not many other ways to say that parties can include any appropriate provisions in a plan as long as they are not prohibited elsewhere.</p><p> Justice Gorsuch avoids this problem by assuming that the question is not how a drafter would grant broad authority that includes releases but rather how a drafter would specifically authorize these exact types of releases. Those are meaningfully different drafting goals. The Courtâs approach requires Congress to add to the Section 1123(b) list as every case reveals a new option. That approach undermines the discretionary language, and, by the Courtâs logic, every addition further constrains discretion and narrows the set of other appropriate provisions.</p></span><span class="NLM_fn" id="fn99"><p><a href="#xref_fn99"><sup>99</sup> </a> <i>Purdue Pharma L.P.</i>, 603 U.S. at 618â21.</p></span><span class="NLM_fn" id="fn100"><p><a href="#xref_fn100"><sup>100</sup> </a> Mission Prod.
