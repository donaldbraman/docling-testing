        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In its 2024 decision overruling the decades-old <em>Chevron</em><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-9483-footnote-2">[1]</a></sup> doctrine directing judges to accept an agency’s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-9483-footnote-3">[2]</a></sup> the Supreme Court declared: “[A]gencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-4" href="#post-9483-footnote-4">[3]</a></sup> In this Article, we reveal this statement to be a profoundly blinkered assertion of judicial hubris. We present findings from a qualitative empirical study of how agencies work with the statutes that give them authority to act, showing that interpreting statutes to ensure that they have effect in the world is at the heart of agency competence. <em>Loper Bright v. Raimondo</em>,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-5" href="#post-9483-footnote-5">[4]</a></sup> much like the Court’s recent supercharging of the “major questions doctrine,”<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560412"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-6" href="#post-9483-footnote-6">[5]</a></sup> rests on two flawed assumptions. The first separates legal interpretation and policymaking into two distinct enterprises—the former belonging to courts, the latter to political actors. The second posits that only Congress, not agencies, should make the important decisions that policymaking requires, on the theory that bureaucrats lack accountability or undermine democracy.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-7" href="#post-9483-footnote-7">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>But these abstractions present a mirage with little grounding in reality and slim normative appeal to boot. Our study of the administrative state suggests not only that the line between law and policy cannot be consistently and constructively drawn, but also that values-driven interpretation and policymaking by agencies are central to our democratic system. Administrative agencies bring statutes to life; their policymaking represents our primary conduit for ensuring that the decisions of democratically elected officials are effectuated in practice.</p>
<p>This basic aspect of the administrative state should be obvious. Indeed, the available evidence suggests that statute drafters, aware of this reality, address agencies with their products.<a id="post-9483-_Ref186669094"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-8" href="#post-9483-footnote-8">[7]</a></sup> But even though a nascent scholarly literature has begun to emphasize the centrality of agencies to American democracy,<a id="post-9483-_Ref186716289"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-9" href="#post-9483-footnote-9">[8]</a></sup> neither doctrine nor scholarship has paid sufficient attention to the everyday realities of how agencies themselves work with statutes.</p>
<p>To address this deficiency, we embarked on our study, which revolved around extensive interviews with dozens of officials across the administrative state. In so doing, we found inspiration in Jerry Mashaw’s recognition, two decades ago, that “[t]here are persuasive grounds for believing that legitimate techniques and standards for agency statutory interpretation diverge sharply from the legitimate techniques and standards for judicial statutory interpretation.”<a id="post-9483-_Ref182743804"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-10" href="#post-9483-footnote-10">[9]</a></sup> But while Mashaw urged scholars to investigate those differences,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-11" href="#post-9483-footnote-11">[10]</a></sup> much work in this area remains theoretical and adopts prescriptive frameworks developed for courts as a baseline against which to evaluate, or imagine, agency action.<a id="post-9483-_Ref187307958"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-12" href="#post-9483-footnote-12">[11]</a></sup> The relatively few empirically oriented studies that investigate agency statutory interpretation also typically accept judicial doctrines and interpretive tenets as the points of departure.<a id="post-9483-_Ref182911620"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-13" href="#post-9483-footnote-13">[12]</a></sup> But judicial interpretation theories tend to be prescriptive rather than empirical.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-14" href="#post-9483-footnote-14">[13]</a></sup> A juricentric orientation also implies that courts sit at the heart of the democratic administration of the laws—a highly debatable proposition. The dominance of the juricentric model has meant that courts and commentators continue to opine on agency decisionmaking without confronting the realities of administration; it has also arguably contributed to judges’ blithe assertions that determining the meaning of statutes amounts to a legal question belonging primarily, even exclusively, to courts.<a id="post-9483-_Ref187786049"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-15" href="#post-9483-footnote-15">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>We designed our study to escape the juricentric model by simply asking agency officials to explain in their own words how they work with the statutory frameworks that give them authority and responsibility to act.<a id="post-9483-_Ref186711348"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-16" href="#post-9483-footnote-16">[15]</a></sup> Accordingly, in this Article, we treat agency practice as a social phenomenon worth studying in its own right; without direct input from the people who perform it, we cannot imagine all of the factors, constraints, and considerations that shape any practice. By casting a light on agencies’ everyday work with statutes, and agency officials’ own internal points of view, we join a small but growing group of scholars adding vital new perspective to a literature dominated by courts, doctrines, and judicial voices.<a id="post-9483-_Ref186799961"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-17" href="#post-9483-footnote-17">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Through our study, we show that agencies’ work with statutes is more complex and multidimensional than courts’.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-18" href="#post-9483-footnote-18">[17]</a></sup> Our interviews ultimately bring to light the pluralistic, deliberative ways agencies construct the regimes elected officials have called for—how, as one interviewee put it, agencies “build [the] thing” their statutes demand.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-19" href="#post-9483-footnote-19">[18]</a></sup> Specifically, our empirical research supports an understanding of agencies as <em>custodians</em> of the statutes they administer.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560566"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-20" href="#post-9483-footnote-20">[19]</a></sup> Regulatory statutes authorize, mandate, and constrain agency action. Agencies, in turn, construct regimes to effectuate their statutes, maintaining them over time even as the enacting political coalition fades away.</p>
<p>Other scholars, such as Mashaw, have described agencies as statutory custodians. Our study sheds light on what this custodial role entails in reality. We find that agencies’ self-conception and behavior can be constructively described as adhering to a pair of concepts from private law: the duty of loyalty and the duty of care. As custodians of a statute, agencies understand themselves to have a general duty to act in the statute’s interest: They are loyal to their statutory regimes, rather than to an imagined unitary Congress or public. And agencies act on their duty of care by bringing together the perspectives and information offered by multiple actors in and out of government to produce reasonable, workable policies. These concepts, though stylized, help capture the aspirations and actions our interviewees discussed.</p>
<p>Our conclusions resonate with recent normative elaborations of a “‘fiduciary model’ in administrative law,” which proposes that we understand statute-enacting electoral coalitions to “entrust [agencies] with regulatory discretion over an area of public concern,” treating agencies as bound by “a duty of fidelity to their statutory mandates, and duties of care and loyalty to their statutory beneficiaries,” while also subjecting agencies to monitoring.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-21" href="#post-9483-footnote-21">[20]</a></sup> For instance, Evan Criddle has argued that agencies’ “fidelity to their legal mandates and the public welfare” offers a form of accountability and responsibility independent of “electoral authorization” or majoritarianism.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-22" href="#post-9483-footnote-22">[21]</a></sup> Others have argued that the Constitution itself imposes a fiduciary imperative on the Executive.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-23" href="#post-9483-footnote-23">[22]</a></sup> Most of this scholarship makes a case that agencies should be understood as having fiduciary duties based on constitutional, normative, or public law principles. We take a more empirical tack. Our interviews indicate that many agency personnel describe their work in ways that comport with the fiduciary model without using that terminology. Numerous agency personnel share a role morality that befits a public fiduciary, giving an empirical basis for public fiduciary theory’s normative arguments.</p>
<p>From our empirical findings, we conclude that democratic governance depends on the work agencies do. Our study offers a rejoinder to abstract battles over constitutional principle—abstractions that obscure political conflicts over the very existence and extent of regulation.<a id="post-9483-_Ref187754492"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-24" href="#post-9483-footnote-24">[23]</a></sup> By looking at agency practices, we explore how government institutions can in fact serve democratic values, giving an empirical foothold to normative ideals like representation, accountability, and the public interest. In other words, our work helps show that administrative agencies and the work they do with statutes are democratically vital and necessary. Recognizing these features seems especially important today, in the face of tectonic doctrinal and political changes that may dramatically transform how agencies function.</p>
<p>We elaborate our findings in Parts I and II of this Article and offer our normative conclusions in Part III. In Part I, we show that officials’ main loyalty is not so much to Congress or the President as to their statutory regimes. This loyalty entails attention to statutory text. Not everyone involved in producing a policy combs through the statutory language, but <em>someone</em> does: Agencies’ divisions of labor allow statutory text to play a central role in the policymaking process without being central to every participant. Taking text seriously, however, does not make agencies textualist. The practices our respondents described do not comport with the tenets of textualism as laid out in judicial interpretive theories, nor did interviewees claim adherence to those tenets.<a id="post-9483-_Ref181650341"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-25" href="#post-9483-footnote-25">[24]</a></sup> A fair number were not sure what textualism even was. Rather, a wide world beyond the text informed their dealings with statutes.</p>
<p>One central factor we found shaping agencies’ work with statutes was the pursuit of agency mission—a factor we identify and define because it emerged so consistently in our interviews. Mission is a cultural factor in agency work, an enduring yet evolving influence over the agency’s role that channels and shapes discretionary decisionmaking. But while mission has a goal-infused quality, being guided by mission does not mean that agencies are purposivist as understood within juricentric theory.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-26" href="#post-9483-footnote-26">[25]</a></sup> Purposivism (like textualism) is an “archeological” approach to interpretation that assumes a statute’s “meaning . . . is set in stone on the date of its enactment, and it is the interpreter’s task to uncover and reconstruct that original meaning.”<a id="post-9483-_Ref181820809"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-27" href="#post-9483-footnote-27">[26]</a></sup> Agencies, in contrast, seek to ensure that a statute remains relevant and efficacious through social, legal, and political changes, sometimes over lengthy periods.<a id="post-9483-_Ref181820686"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-28" href="#post-9483-footnote-28">[27]</a></sup> The sense of mission we found was rooted in the statute but not coterminous with its text or even its enacting context—it evolved over time.</p>
<p>We also found that the concept of mission helps structure the interagency interactions and conflicts that form an integral part of the policymaking process. An agency, after all, cannot make policy on its own: Agencies are not just structured by internal divisions of labor, but subject to external ones as well. More than one agency often has a say in any given process, and agencies with differing missions will bring differing normative considerations and practical concerns to bear. This pluralistic phenomenon may arise by congressional design and create productive counterweights within the policymaking process, but it can also impede agencies’ custodial abilities by enabling one agency’s mission to run roughshod over others’. Text and mission ultimately focus officials on the interests of the statutory regime itself—not quite the same thing as the Congress that enacted the statute, nor the Congress that currently oversees the agency’s work, nor a presidential administration past or present.</p>
<p>In Part II, we show how agencies perform their duty of loyalty by exercising a duty of care, which they understand as making statutes workable. This pursuit of workability requires developing policies that will be effective and implementable.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-29" href="#post-9483-footnote-29">[28]</a></sup> But it also requires incorporating pluralistic demands into decisionmaking: responding to the emergence of new technologies; absorbing popular and interest-group demands; formulating policy that will survive judicial review so that it can have practical effect; taking input from members of Congress and congressional committees; and reconciling the aims of a presidential administration with longer term agency missions and statutory directives.</p>
<p>In Part III, we argue that the forms of agency decisionmaking we document perform vital democratic work in our system of government. We then spell out the institutional, political, and doctrinal implications of the picture we see. Agencies frequently serve as sites for democratic contestation, making them as central to channeling popular sentiments and promoting social welfare as the political bodies that create and oversee them. This work, our research shows, is pluralistic and contestatory; it takes into account policies’ consequences and workability; it combines expertise and experience with political influence and public pressures; and it is grounded in authority granted by elected officials. But because agencies retain responsibility for their regulatory regimes well beyond the tenure of any statute-enacting coalition, their statutory work also helps connect successive political regimes and real-world developments, balancing interests in stability and change. This balancing gives rise to tensions, even potentially irreconcilable differences, between views of what a statute should be—between historical and contemporary understandings. These tensions are not just pesky incidentals; they are a central fact of democratic governance, which requires respecting the enactments of past governing coalitions as well as the needs and interests of the people statutes govern in the present.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-30" href="#post-9483-footnote-30">[29]</a></sup> Agency work with statutes thus offers one essential way our system of government addresses the dead-hand problem presented by legal enactments.</p>
<p>Agency work with statutes, of course, is neither perfect nor perfectible; it has biases, blind spots, and limitations, and many aspects of the administrative state may well be in need of reform. But we think that our study helps to substantiate that, from a comparative institutional perspective, no other United States government institution equals agencies’ capacity for the effectuation of statutes. The Supreme Court’s evolving administrative law doctrines, though cloaked in the language of balanced powers, actually channel decisions about both general delegation and specific policy to the courts.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-31" href="#post-9483-footnote-31">[30]</a></sup> But, lacking capacity, courts are not up to the job. Agencies’ ongoing, pluralistic practices make them the superior institutional choice for the foundational aspects of democratic governance the Court increasingly arrogates to itself. All of this suggests that, while judicial doctrine and political discourse often denigrate and undermine agency work, the capabilities we bring to light should be recognized and strengthened, not dismissed, by future courts and Congresses. Our research helps show just how anti-democratic the administrative law of the Roberts Court turns out to be.</p>
<p>Because our claims diverge from the Supreme Court’s current direction, not to mention the motivations behind the second Trump Administration’s assault on the state’s very existence, it is all the more vital to present the picture we do. We have no illusions about our ability to persuade the current Court to unwind its multifarious assertions of judicial dominance over the administrative state. Some readers might even take our findings to justify the Court’s anti-administrative impulses as articulated in the unitary executive theory, the major questions doctrine, and nondelegation concerns.<a id="post-9483-_Ref181710221"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-32" href="#post-9483-footnote-32">[31]</a></sup> In fact, though, our study offers a picture of a state capable of being democratic in an ongoing, day-to-day way. We thus illuminate the realities of the institutional context the Court’s doctrinal trends target but distort. We underscore the political stakes of these supposedly purely legal interventions—political stakes that Congress, presidential administrations, and lower courts, as well as the broader public, should acknowledge. And we offer a picture of the state that should inform the ongoing struggle over how to make government work and, increasingly, over why it should exist at all.</p>
<p>We reach our conclusions through an interpretive empirical process based in the qualitative social sciences—a process worth explaining in more detail before we turn to our findings.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-33" href="#post-9483-footnote-33">[32]</a></sup> The primary data for this project comprises thirty-nine semi-structured interviews with political appointees and career civil servants from eleven agencies, including smaller and larger, older and newer, primarily benefits-managing and primarily conduct-regulating components.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-34" href="#post-9483-footnote-34">[33]</a></sup> We asked respondents to discuss how the process of converting a statute into a regulatory regime worked in their agency, both in general terms and in the context of specific initiatives.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-35" href="#post-9483-footnote-35">[34]</a></sup> Often with a focus on particular projects in which a respondent participated, we asked about the tools their agencies used to make regulations; about the role of Congress, the President, other agencies, and states in that process; and about the influence of courts, judicial doctrine, and the specter of litigation. We mostly asked respondents about their experiences rather than their opinions, using open-ended phrasings to encourage participants to form answers in their own terms, instead of agreeing or disagreeing with ours. At the end of each interview, we then posed several questions to probe respondents’ opinions and understandings of the place of their own work in the larger field of statutory interpretation.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-36" href="#post-9483-footnote-36">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although our interviewees differed along many axes—the roles they occupied, the kinds of agencies they worked for, the presidential administrations they served under, the subject matter they dealt with—their descriptions of their work also converged in significant ways. In this Article, we focus on those convergences, presenting a rarely seen agency perspective on statutory work. At the same time, we have not limited ourselves to our interviewees’ words, and we do not merely report what they told us. Rather, we place our interview data in the context of statutory interpretation scholarship, doctrinal developments, and democratic theory. We also evaluate our data’s implications for democratic governance—a phenomenon we did not ask our interviewees to address.</p>
<p>As our interviewees demonstrated, agency work with statutes often involves influences, practices, restrictions, and considerations that doctrinal and theoretical accounts generally do not recognize, much less analyze. Such internal workings are difficult to identify in publicly visible end products like Federal Register notices. When we reviewed the rulemaking publications of many of the specific policies our interviewees discussed, we found little sign of the intensive production process our respondents revealed to us.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-37" href="#post-9483-footnote-37">[36]</a></sup> That is to be expected. The Federal Register presents the public with the outcomes of agency processes and the reasons that best support those results—it does not purport to provide a policy’s biography. But to understand what administrative agencies actually do within our system requires this very knowledge.</p>
<p>Like any method, our qualitative interview study can only provide a partial picture. We talked to a limited number of people in a limited number of agencies, and we do not purport to report on the practices and views of all two million employees of the federal bureaucracy. We talked only to people who were interested in talking to us, so our sample likely overrepresents certain characteristics like self-reflection, a desire to publicize one’s work, or congeniality to academic research. Respondents may also have wanted, consciously or not, to present themselves in a flattering light, skewing the information they gave us toward the positive. We sought to mitigate such skewing by focusing our questions on facts and experiences, rather than evaluations or opinions, and by finding areas where differently situated interviewees largely overlapped in their descriptions of internal agency workings.</p>
<p>Whatever the limitations of this qualitative methodology, it is worth noting that much research on statutory interpretation already suffers from biases analogous to, and arguably more severe than, those of our interviews.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-38" href="#post-9483-footnote-38">[37]</a></sup> That research takes as its primary data judicial opinions: curated vehicles for justifying court decisions, written for public consumption.<a id="post-9483-_Ref182660143"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-39" href="#post-9483-footnote-39">[38]</a></sup> Yet, scholars have found judicial opinions worth studying because they do reveal some things about how judges interpret statutes. Our research provides an essential corrective to the biases of the juricentric approach by revealing some of the everyday practices of agencies’ work.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-40" href="#post-9483-footnote-40">[39]</a></sup> It thus presents a perspective central to the effectuation of federal law that nonetheless remains mostly absent from scholarly discussions about it: the perspective of agency personnel.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-41" href="#post-9483-footnote-41">[40]</a></sup></p>

The Duty of Loyalty: Serving the Statute</h2>
<p>Agencies implement and administer the statutes that give them authority to act. Whom, or what, do they serve in that process? A transmission belt model suggests that agencies serve Congress;<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560790"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-42" href="#post-9483-footnote-42">[41]</a></sup> a presidentialist approach suggests the President.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-43" href="#post-9483-footnote-43">[42]</a></sup> Much administrative-law and separation-of-powers scholarship contends at length over which of the two constitutional branches agencies should and do serve. Our study indicates, instead, that agencies serve something else both obvious and overlooked: They bear a duty of loyalty to statutes themselves. Both Congress and the President contribute to enacting statutes, but in our interviews, statutes <em>qua </em>statutes transcended the two branches. Recognizing the centrality of the statutes themselves helps reveal agencies’ crucial role within our democratic system of government—a role increasingly under pressure from Supreme Court doctrine as well as presidential politics.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-44" href="#post-9483-footnote-44">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scholarly literature often discusses agencies’ relations with the legislature as though Congress were an enduring body that remained self-same over time. But most agencies, most of the time, work with statutes produced by past Congresses, even as their work is overseen and enabled by the sitting Congress. An agency could simply transfer loyalty from one Congress to the next or retain loyalty to the enacting Congress. Our interviewees painted a more complicated picture, however, of loyalty to a statutory regime—a regime constructed not just at the moment of enactment, but over time through statutory amendments, agency action, and doctrinal and political developments.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-45" href="#post-9483-footnote-45">[44]</a></sup> “Obviously, you want to get along with Congress,” one interviewee observed, “but at the same time you’re trying to be . . . a good steward to the program and adhere to the statute.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-46" href="#post-9483-footnote-46">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>This obligation of “stewardship” emerged forcefully in our interviews, reinforcing observations by other scholars, such as Jerry Mashaw, David Spence, and Jody Freeman, who have described agencies as statutes’ congressionally appointed custodians.<a id="post-9483-_Ref156939161"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-47" href="#post-9483-footnote-47">[46]</a></sup> When a Congress and a President enact a regulatory statute, they place some socioeconomic arena within an agency’s purview, tasking the agency with addressing matters that arise within that arena. The statute gives the agency legal authority and resources for this work, even as it constrains the agency’s decisionmaking scope through mandates, guidelines, and exceptions. The statute is thus the main backdrop against which agency action takes place. Our study not only shows that agency officials often understand themselves to be playing this custodial role but also reveals what this role actually consists of.</p>
<p>In this Part, we explain how agencies understand their duty of loyalty to their statutes—their obligation to work in the statute’s best interest. We first show that agency officials work closely with their statutory texts, which serve simultaneously as a source of authority, a resource for action, and a constraint. Agencies’ work with statutory text is tied inextricably to their policy objectives. But officials do not pursue those objectives in a freewheeling fashion. Instead, loyalty to statutes is grounded in what we call agency mission: an overarching set of values and objectives served by the regulatory regimes agency officials superintend. When determining what their statutes authorize, obligate, or enable them to do, agency officials frequently understand themselves as serving their agency’s mission. This Part articulates and defines the phenomenon of agency mission—a central influence over agency action not sufficiently appreciated in the literature—and explains how it structures agencies’ loyalty and channels their decisions.</p>

Statutory Texts</h3>
<p>Agency officials in our study, across the board, clearly understood their need for statutory authority to act. They showed both an interest in and fidelity to their statutes’ texts. As one person put it, “[E]very single thing I worked on was always carefully analyzed at the highest level about, ‘Do we have the authority to do this? Does the statute say this? Has it always been interpreted this way? Can we really say that?’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-48" href="#post-9483-footnote-48">[47]</a></sup> Indeed, statutory texts can foil well-considered policy plans. “I came to the agency thinking I was going to do a specific thing, and I was totally convinced that we absolutely had the authority to do it. We better get right on it,” one political appointee told us.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-49" href="#post-9483-footnote-49">[48]</a></sup> But after looking further into the statute itself, researching “what does this really mean and how did it get there? And how did the agency do this other thing last time?” this person “realized, ‘Oh my god, . . . we have no justification for’” the contemplated policy.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-50" href="#post-9483-footnote-50">[49]</a></sup> “‘I guess we can’t do it.’ I had no idea.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-51" href="#post-9483-footnote-51">[50]</a></sup> As another official noted, sometimes a statute could be “so clear that there’s really nothing to interpret.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-52" href="#post-9483-footnote-52">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, interviewees consistently emphasized the open-ended quality of many statutes they worked with.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-53" href="#post-9483-footnote-53">[52]</a></sup> As one noted, the “typical framework [is] Congress generally would set . . . broad statutory [goals], but would leave a lot of the technical details to the agency to set up.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-54" href="#post-9483-footnote-54">[53]</a></sup> The discretion conferred by open-ended statutes also extends well beyond the filling up of technical details.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-55" href="#post-9483-footnote-55">[54]</a></sup> Regulatory statutes often do not require one particular response to a given issue; they allow for multiple possible solutions to any one problem.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-56" href="#post-9483-footnote-56">[55]</a></sup> As one person put it, “Congress writes laws that are these huge balancing acts. They craft these very intricate compromises, and different . . . members of Congress have different points of view of what the law should be . . . . That creates a lot of indecision, and it creates a lot of discretion for the agency.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-57" href="#post-9483-footnote-57">[56]</a></sup> Some described this open-endedness as inevitable. “I thought drafting legislation would be a piece of cake,” one respondent who had provided legislative drafting assistance from the agency’s side recalled.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-58" href="#post-9483-footnote-58">[57]</a></sup> “It’s insanely hard. You think you’ve covered everything and then you give it to five people and they say, well what about this, what about that.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-59" href="#post-9483-footnote-59">[58]</a></sup> Another interviewee had drafted legislation as a congressional staffer before going to work in the agency charged with implementing the resulting statute.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-60" href="#post-9483-footnote-60">[59]</a></sup> “The words end up on the page <em>because</em> they are unclear,” this person told us: “[E]verybody can see their own outcomes . . . [and] goals in them.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-61" href="#post-9483-footnote-61">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>In its custodial role, the agency must find sense and coherence when implementing open-ended texts and words.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-62" href="#post-9483-footnote-62">[61]</a></sup> But our subjects generally did not describe themselves as searching for a statutory text’s “best” meaning most of the time: Statutes’ pervasive open-endedness meant that, often, there was no necessarily best interpretation of any given provision. Our respondents agreed that statutory text must be able to bear the meanings a policy ascribes to the text, but as one official put it, “[i]t was very hard to say what would be the best interpretation independent of policy consideration[s].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-63" href="#post-9483-footnote-63">[62]</a></sup> As another suggested, “Once Congress unleashed the tools, I think [agency officials] view it as their responsibility to utilize those tools from a policy choice as best as they think is appropriate for the public interest,” and “they’re going to experiment and do that until a court would tell them that they have misinterpreted the powers that were given to them.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-64" href="#post-9483-footnote-64">[63]</a></sup> Rather than searching for an eternal, uniquely correct meaning, agencies generally work with statutory text to “advance reasonable interpretations that we thought best served the policy goals of the statute and of the administration.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-65" href="#post-9483-footnote-65">[64]</a></sup> And in the case of “a really badly drafted statute,” with which “you were sort of trying to make a set of words [work] in the context that it wouldn’t normally work in,” there might be no other choice than asking, “[H]ere’s our broader goal. How do we fit that within what these [words] mean[]?”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-66" href="#post-9483-footnote-66">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other officials were even more explicit that their use of statutes was goal driven—motivated by a pragmatic impulse to create effective policy grounded in statutory authority. As interviewees underscored in describing their work with statutes, agencies (especially lawyers) often ask: Does the statute support a desired policy? Does it offer underutilized authorities?<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-67" href="#post-9483-footnote-67">[66]</a></sup> Can we reconfigure existing rules for new purposes? Some respondents described themselves as turning to statutes in search of authority to support or enable what they sought to do, not always to understand in the first instance what they were <em>supposed</em> to do: “[T]he first question isn’t ‘what do these statutory words mean?,’ because you’re in a space. You’re regulating within a space . . . and then it becomes, you want to do this thing . . . and then you’re going back in statutes to see if you can do it.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-68" href="#post-9483-footnote-68">[67]</a></sup> As another subject said, “I can literally remember being in the room and who the colleague was who had crawled through every part of the statute to say, well, where’s a thing that we could waive that would provide some flexibility on this.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-69" href="#post-9483-footnote-69">[68]</a></sup> While agency lawyers may help policymakers “figure out congressional intent” and while “courts have their rules about what to turn to first, and which documents have precedence,” one official told us, “my experience just on a practical level, it’s really case-by-case, and it’s driven by the political process, driven by the goals you’re setting for the agency.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-70" href="#post-9483-footnote-70">[69]</a></sup> Creative use of statutory text might even become part of the job: “[P]eople are trying to push the boundaries by reading the regulations that are on the books the way that they think they need to do their job, not so much a power grab as you’re a professional, you’re trying to accomplish your goal, trying to be creative.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-71" href="#post-9483-footnote-71">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interviewees also described how statutes could become more ambiguous or open-ended over time because of changing circumstances and statutory amendments.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560727"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-72" href="#post-9483-footnote-72">[71]</a></sup> “[Y]ou could have historical precedents from older language, and now newer language is in conflict with that older language, and the older language has not been removed from the statute,” one person explained.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-73" href="#post-9483-footnote-73">[72]</a></sup> Although in principle, “the newer language trumps the older language, . . . it’s not always that clear. Sometimes, it’s not as though it’s in conflict or even informing it, it could make what’s already an ambiguous provision even more ambiguous.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-74" href="#post-9483-footnote-74">[73]</a></sup> Other legal developments might contribute to this evolution, too: “A lot of times we were working with statutes that had a history, so it would be not only the language of the statute would be relevant or legislative history, but there’d be a fairly substantial case history . . . [making a] precedential body.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-75" href="#post-9483-footnote-75">[74]</a></sup> And sometimes “things just aren’t spelled out,” and officials might turn to their own foundational documents for guidance as to how to proceed.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-76" href="#post-9483-footnote-76">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, attention to statutory text was unevenly distributed amongst our respondents. As one non-lawyer put it, “I guess you could say the statute’s in the back of our mind . . . [b]ut nobody’s going out and reading the caselaw or anything like that.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-77" href="#post-9483-footnote-77">[76]</a></sup> “To be honest with you,” a subject-matter expert told us, “I never read the Act nor did I think most people on a day-to-day basis were aware of it. . . . [A]s a political appointee, . . . [I] had a few different missions and responses.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-78" href="#post-9483-footnote-78">[77]</a></sup> For some officials, lawyerly approaches to statutory authority stood in the way of accomplishing the agency’s objectives: “Sometimes there’s an undercurrent of ‘the darn lawyers are slowing us down’ and ‘we care about . . . safety.’ That line gets used in the agency itself against the lawyers” who ensure statutory fidelity.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-79" href="#post-9483-footnote-79">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>But even while some people involved in policymaking may not read the statute or the case law, there are always others who do. It perhaps should come as no surprise that lawyers within agencies play a significant, if not lead, role in tying agency action to fidelity to statutory texts. Officials highlighted general counsel offices’ important role in ensuring concordance between policy and statute. As one interviewee explained, interpretive creativity can generate “pushback” from lawyers, underscoring that agency lawyers (and other career civil servants) often set the bounds of work with statutes.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-80" href="#post-9483-footnote-80">[79]</a></sup> But even as agencies treat statutory text as foundational to their policymaking process, statutory text in itself does not suffice to resolve the issues agencies tackle. As one person put it, “Once you’ve said, ‘Oh the statute allows us to do this and such . . . ,’ then the statute is no longer answering the question.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-81" href="#post-9483-footnote-81">[80]</a></sup> Statutory text thus becomes an adaptable, but not infinitely malleable, resource for an agency addressing the issues that the statute itself places within the agency’s purview. Officials elaborate on the text with goals and values in mind. These goals and values—the overarching sense of <em>mission</em> we turn to in the following subpart—help orient officials’ sense of responsibility for the statutory regime<em>.</em></p>
<h3><a id="post-9483-_Toc156419185"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc156662192"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc156662205"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158282695"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158623602"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708818"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708837"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712152"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737882"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339778"></a> B. Agency Mission</h3>
<p>Throughout our interviews, we identified a second dimension of the duty of loyalty that shaped officials’ pursuit of policy goals within statutory frameworks. Officials across agencies displayed a commitment to overarching objectives and values that they cited as representing the fundamental purposes of the agency’s work.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560631"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-82" href="#post-9483-footnote-82">[81]</a></sup> This sense of agency mission guided how officials put statutes to work in any given context. Rather than settling the meaning of a particular word or the details of a specific policy, officials spoke of agency mission as providing a general value orientation that influenced how they approached their policy choices, without determining the conclusions they would come to. While certainly not the exclusive source of officials’ purpose or motivation, mission operated as a rudder to steer agencies’ work with their statutes and gave their work a rough coherence over time.</p>
<p>We focus in this subpart on defining the factors that we saw shaping officials’ sense of mission. Crucially, the concept was often grounded in a set of statutory enactments and their particular purposes,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-83" href="#post-9483-footnote-83">[82]</a></sup> but it also evolved diachronically, taking shape over time under the influence of presidential administrations, subsequent Congresses, litigation, public participation, and changing circumstances in the regulated world.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-84" href="#post-9483-footnote-84">[83]</a></sup> Whereas statutory background exerted a pull from the past, harking back to the coalition that enacted the statute, ongoing political projects and interactions pulled the agency forward. The commitment to mission thus pushed officials to coordinate values across groups and over time.</p>
<h4><a id="post-9483-_Toc158623603"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708819"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708838"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712153"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737883"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339779"></a> <em>1. Sources of Mission</em></h4>
<p>.—The statutes that mandate and constrain agency action are central determinants of an agency’s mission. Specific statutory language or a foundational committee report may define a clear mission that carries through all of the agency’s work. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which created the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), itself articulated the Act’s overarching mission: “to protect the health and safety of the Nation’s coal miners.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-85" href="#post-9483-footnote-85">[84]</a></sup> Congress passed the statute as a direct response to a massive underground mine explosion, and the statute’s supporting committee report clearly articulated a vision repeated by President Nixon upon signing the bill—that it was “a crucially needed step forward in the protection of America’s coal miners.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-86" href="#post-9483-footnote-86">[85]</a></sup> MSHA officials in our study described that mission as permeating the agency’s work and its officials’ self-conception. “[E]verybody I work with is very focused on mine safety. The legislative history specifically says everything should be interpreted, when in doubt, on the side of mine safety. I sort of take that command from Congress. It’s nothing that would need to be said.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-87" href="#post-9483-footnote-87">[86]</a></sup> This explicit “unidirectional mandate”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-88" href="#post-9483-footnote-88">[87]</a></sup> makes MSHA decisionmaking “always about safety, and health, and . . . how best to promote safety and health within . . . the possible range of interpretations.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-89" href="#post-9483-footnote-89">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even when an agency’s mission was not so expressly laid out in text, though, officials described how an implicit understanding of the agency’s basic orientation guided their work with statutes. “[A]t the [end of] the day,” an official from the Small Business Administration told us, “we’re trying to help businesses get contracts, so they can employ people, that’s what our mission is. We want to do it in a way that . . . is as efficient and least burdensome as can be based on the language of the statute.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-90" href="#post-9483-footnote-90">[89]</a></sup> We heard that kind of overarching, general, and relatively simple sense of mission repeatedly in our interviews, often in the course of an official explaining some particular process or decision. “Sort of the unifying thing about [a particular agency],” another subject said, is that all parts of it are “very much focused on preventing harm to [a particular group].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-91" href="#post-9483-footnote-91">[90]</a></sup> As another person put it, “[W]e’re dealing with a very mission-oriented agency, an agency that thinks if the air is cleaner we’re doing a good job, not like if [some] company has higher profits we’re doing a good job.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-92" href="#post-9483-footnote-92">[91]</a></sup> Officials might ask in a “broad sense, what is the statute trying to do? Maybe it’s trying to clean up the air and water and if so, then let’s lean in that direction.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-93" href="#post-9483-footnote-93">[92]</a></sup> Another spoke in terms of a statute’s overarching purpose: to “best serve the Medicare beneficiaries because ultimately that’s what Medicare’s there to serve. It’s not for hospitals, or doctors, or other clinicians.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-94" href="#post-9483-footnote-94">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even as agency officials characterized themselves as seeking to advance their mission, they also demonstrated a commitment to pursuing the priorities of the extant presidential administration. Importantly, however, we found that the latter can often be complementary to or shaped by the former. As we have documented elsewhere, we consistently heard about the ways in which political officials defined agencies’ purposes: “[T]he people who work at senior levels . . . , they come in with an agenda,” one official told us—an agenda that drives them to analyze the relevant statute for the “degrees of freedom you have to make changes to regulation.”<a id="post-9483-_Ref158459316"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-95" href="#post-9483-footnote-95">[94]</a></sup> Some officials saw their work as necessarily closely aligned with presidential projects: “We’re an executive agency, so it’s hard to think about priorities of the agency that aren’t also the President’s priorities.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-96" href="#post-9483-footnote-96">[95]</a></sup> And “a particular philosophy within a given administration,” such as creating “innovation” or “bringing new technology into the system,” might lead officials to “try[] to find interpretations that allow us to do that versus maybe some other kind” of policy.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-97" href="#post-9483-footnote-97">[96]</a></sup> Political officials might be particularly motivated by public perception and political salience, especially in relation to hot-button issues.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-98" href="#post-9483-footnote-98">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the interaction between a particular administration’s philosophy and priorities and the preexisting sense of agency mission could be complex. On the one hand, “there’s a natural hesitancy to just overturn past interpretations. . . . [F]or one thing you want the work you did to live on. . . . [Y]ou don’t want to create a culture where you think it’s okay for every new administration just to undo everything that was done before.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-99" href="#post-9483-footnote-99">[98]</a></sup> As a career civil servant told us, “I think most [political appointees] just want to come in and manage the stewardship of the program and propel it forward and make it better for the next generation.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-100" href="#post-9483-footnote-100">[99]</a></sup> At the same time, appointees generally were understood to come in with political objectives and ideological predilections—projects they wanted to accomplish and values they wanted to pursue.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-101" href="#post-9483-footnote-101">[100]</a></sup> Career staff, with generally longer tenures, could have different reactions to that: “[A] lot of times when a politico comes along and says, ‘Hey, we’re going to go 100% recycled,’ sometimes the career staffers are rolling their eyes and sometimes, they’re like, ‘Okay, awesome, here’s my opportunity.’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-102" href="#post-9483-footnote-102">[101]</a></sup> Either way, political appointees often needed to integrate their goals with a longer term sense of agency mission to be successful: As we have argued elsewhere, political appointees and career civil servants play complementary, interdependent roles, each crucial to the agency’s work.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-103" href="#post-9483-footnote-103">[102]</a></sup> Appointees may come in with political objectives and ideological predilections, but they may also join agencies because of some concordance between their own professional objectives and the agency’s work.</p>
<p>Regardless of their intentions, political officials can find their ability to advance preferred objectives constrained by the mission-driven and statutorily defined boundaries of the institutions they enter. “In any change of administration, there are always changes at the edges, and we expect that. But in terms of core principles and activities, they more or less remain the same.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-104" href="#post-9483-footnote-104">[103]</a></sup> Indeed, our interviews underscored how agencies can develop a strong sense of internal culture and character—a self-understanding of “how we do things around here” that guides decisions, whether that is a “long history . . . of bipartisan cooperation” in an independent agency,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-105" href="#post-9483-footnote-105">[104]</a></sup> an understanding that an agency-internal body “does not like to overrule itself,”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-106" href="#post-9483-footnote-106">[105]</a></sup> or a culture of “everybody staying in their lane.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-107" href="#post-9483-footnote-107">[106]</a></sup> Long-serving career officials, many of whom relate deeply to their agency’s mission, are likely to internalize the agency’s culture and purposes, carrying them through the agency’s work across administrations.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-108" href="#post-9483-footnote-108">[107]</a></sup> One interviewee explained how long-time officials’ commitment to mission might constrain political ambitions: “[C]areer folks tend to be much more conservative or let’s just say risk averse and tend to think of themselves as the keeper of the programs and wanting to keep the bad people out as opposed to the opposite, trying to get more people in.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-109" href="#post-9483-footnote-109">[108]</a></sup> Our interviews suggest that we should think of political officials’ ambitions as being incorporated into rather than replacing agency mission.</p>
<h4><a id="post-9483-_Toc156419187"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc156662194"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc156662207"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158282697"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158623604"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708820"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708839"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712154"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737884"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339780"></a><em> 2. Mission as Rudder</em></h4>
<p>.—As our account of agencies’ work with statutory texts underscores, officials’ pursuit of agency mission did not replace the analysis of texts. Instead, officials’ sense of mission provided them with a rudder that steered their decisions about available policy options. A sense of agency mission can provide a common orientation across multiple decisionmakers, even while it remains somewhat general and subject to gradual change. Statutes, after all, construct complex environments with many competing priorities: Any given provision’s instruction can be read in a number of ways. Most statutes do not specify one single value to hold above all others. Figuring out how to actually proceed requires policy judgment. Making a plan for regulatory action takes more than just identifying what the statute allows.</p>
<p>Interviewees explained how agencies must consider the effects they seek to achieve, the values they hope to serve, and how their choices relate to other policy goals whose relative costs and benefits may be hard to commensurate.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-110" href="#post-9483-footnote-110">[109]</a></sup> As one interviewee explained, “You have to turn to how much [regulatory] protection you want, how much cost you’re willing to impose, what the politics are.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-111" href="#post-9483-footnote-111">[110]</a></sup> Another, in the context of a consumer protection statute, noted that the agency considered “[w]hat’s good for the American consumer . . . ? Also, . . . what works for business? . . . [You must be m]indful for the effects of your legislation on a bunch of stakeholders.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-112" href="#post-9483-footnote-112">[111]</a></sup> Because agency action affects different people in different ways, a benefit often comes with its own cost: Simplifying eligible people’s access to entitlements increases opportunities for ineligible people to gain access, but blocking ineligible people increases the obstacles to eligible people too. Statutes rarely spell out the terms of these tradeoffs.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-113" href="#post-9483-footnote-113">[112]</a></sup> But as we saw in our interviews, a sense of mission can help steer these choices by keeping officials alert to the normative decisions that policymaking inevitably involves.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-114" href="#post-9483-footnote-114">[113]</a></sup></p>
<p>We also observed how the sense of agency mission can help agencies adapt to novel circumstances in a coherent way. As one interviewee described updating a rule, the “first step is, we have a problem. The second step is, we can solve this problem . . . by revising . . . and updating our rule, and three is, we will try to rewrite the rule in a way that we think fulfills the mission Congress set out for us [in the statute].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-115" href="#post-9483-footnote-115">[114]</a></sup> Another interviewee provided an example of that kind of adaptation. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, did not exist when the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) was given responsibility for aviation; its “rulemaking . . . process is all designed for safety and certification of things that have people in them, and thus qualifications for pilots.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-116" href="#post-9483-footnote-116">[115]</a></sup> To address developments in the area that its statute placed within its purview, the agency found itself “trying to construct old statutes in new ways.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-117" href="#post-9483-footnote-117">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>Any individual statute managed by a given agency, moreover, is part of a larger statutory and regulatory context involving other agencies and officials. Agencies often find themselves in “shared regulatory space.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-118" href="#post-9483-footnote-118">[117]</a></sup> Conflicts over policy priorities and responsibility distribution underscored how different missions influenced agencies’ policy orientations. “Government agencies may have very conflicting objectives,” one person explained.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-119" href="#post-9483-footnote-119">[118]</a></sup> As one respondent put it, “different agencies . . . come to it with their own biases and their own historical interpretations and their own kind of equities.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-120" href="#post-9483-footnote-120">[119]</a></sup> Another observed that “[e]ach department is also sort of producing their own sort of processes for how to interpret congressional intent.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-121" href="#post-9483-footnote-121">[120]</a></sup></p>
<p>Take the example of two components of the Department of Health and Human Services coming up against each other. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), primarily in charge of medical product safety, “was adamant that . . . there’s a . . . safety risk associated with” a particular medical product prepared in a relatively inexpensive way.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-122" href="#post-9483-footnote-122">[121]</a></sup> Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), primarily in charge of payments for the medical product, “had a study where it said that the risks were very low . . . . [Y]ou had two agencies who had very, very different policy goals because their missions are very different. This is not uncommon.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-123" href="#post-9483-footnote-123">[122]</a></sup> Agencies can, in other words, push one another to examine the contours of their statutory authorities by interpreting those authorities in light of their respective missions.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-124" href="#post-9483-footnote-124">[123]</a></sup> In this sense, agency mission plays a coordinating role among perspectives not just over time, but also across the government at a given time.</p>
<p>Such interactions also emerge because “some [statutory] provisions don’t have a natural home.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-125" href="#post-9483-footnote-125">[124]</a></sup> In one example, the National Transportation Safety Board proposed that the FAA, in charge of aircraft, and CMS, in charge of Medicare ambulance payments, jointly produce safety standards for ambulance helicopters. This pushed each agency to determine whose regulatory sphere such vehicles fell into.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-126" href="#post-9483-footnote-126">[125]</a></sup> CMS sought a constrained, rather than expanded, sphere of power. “That actually is a fairly common thing,” our subject told us, “where one part of the agency is basically trying to avoid responsibility for a particular provision, so they’re trying to get it assigned to somebody else.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-127" href="#post-9483-footnote-127">[126]</a></sup> Even statutory provisions that could land in more than one “home” require particular kinds of expertise. “[T]he last person you want to be regulating helicopter safety,” our healthcare system expert told us, “is somebody like me.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-128" href="#post-9483-footnote-128">[127]</a></sup> Although ambulance helicopters fell into CMS’s core function of managing healthcare costs, the agency sought to place safety standards for these aircraft elsewhere because such safety considerations fell outside of the agency’s sense of expertise and mission.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The sense of agency mission we identified helped officials define problems worth addressing and identify the policy experiments or political conflicts worth engaging in. As one official put it, “I think that, in the end, . . . people thought that the statutes were kind of with them. . . . They had the law at their backs and that doesn’t come from particular little words in a statute.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-129" href="#post-9483-footnote-129">[128]</a></sup> Indeed, many of our respondents defined their success in terms of the extent to which they advanced the agency’s mission.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-130" href="#post-9483-footnote-130">[129]</a></sup> Effective policy could mean “maki[ng] sure whatever you do, you’re building enough program integrity into the system so that you don’t make it easy for scoundrels and fraudsters to come and raid the . . . program.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-131" href="#post-9483-footnote-131">[130]</a></sup> From the administrator’s perspective, this utility helps explain the pervasive influence of mission we observed in policymaking. From a systemic standpoint, this sense of mission helps agencies mediate differing policy perspectives over historical time and sociological space.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-132" href="#post-9483-footnote-132">[131]</a></sup></p>

The Duty of Care: Producing Policy that Works</h2>
<p>For agencies to fulfill their role as custodians of statutes, they must “build [the] thing”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-133" href="#post-9483-footnote-133">[132]</a></sup> for which they were given responsibility. In our interviews, we saw pervasive and consistent preoccupation with ensuring that statutory schemes <em>worked</em>—that the rules, guidelines, and policies agencies adopted functioned effectively in the contexts and circumstances within the agencies’ purview. Our respondents made clear that statutes were not so much for understanding as for governing: “So, your statute is incredibly general, and so then you need to make it real.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-134" href="#post-9483-footnote-134">[133]</a></sup></p>
<p>Agency personnel often described themselves as acting incrementally, focusing on the practical effects of their policy choices. One person involved in Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation described the kinds of considerations that went into any policy decision: “One is just . . . ‘Will this make the marketplace stronger? Will it make it easier for the insurance companies that are participating to . . . price risk?,’” thereby encouraging participation and helping effectuate the statute.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-135" href="#post-9483-footnote-135">[134]</a></sup> “The second . . . ‘Will it be more efficient?’ Like just eliminate points of friction in the system. And then another dimension is . . . ‘Will it protect people from abuses by other actors in the system?’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-136" href="#post-9483-footnote-136">[135]</a></sup> Many respondents shared this overarching practical concern with policy effects. “[Y]ou always know that statutes are enacted for some purpose,” one said.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561886"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-137" href="#post-9483-footnote-137">[136]</a></sup> “They have some goal in mind. . . . So then the question is, whether [the policy] advances the purpose of the statute . . . consistent with what the statute requires, and [considering] what burdens are going to be imposed on the people who have to live with it.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-138" href="#post-9483-footnote-138">[137]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our interviews show agency officials seeking practicable paths to implement statutes in an admittedly provisional way, subject to adjustment down the line. This effort instantiated in them what appeared to us as a <em>duty of care</em> for the statutes that designated the agencies as custodians. In this Part, we describe how administrators in our study acted on this duty of care—how they interpreted and implemented their statutes to make them real and effective. This process involved ongoing interaction and negotiation with numerous actors and factors: external events, other administrators, other government branches, and public pressures. Officials sought to respond to events and realities in the world—to ensure that their policy plans addressed lived experience, changing circumstances, and the goals and needs of the regulated public. Just as important, they incorporated other actors in the democratic system—the political branches (who could also be sources of information about the needs of the regulated public) and the courts. These forms of pluralistic responsiveness showed officials’ awareness of the concrete value and legitimating effect of incorporating the views of entities capable of both enabling and thwarting agency work.</p>
<p>By bringing these elements of the duty of care to light, our study shows that agencies tend to be self-consciously pragmatic; they are not typically searching for transhistorically or absolutely correct answers.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561612"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-139" href="#post-9483-footnote-139">[138]</a></sup> We show how agencies, as their statute’s custodians, mediate and participate in defining their statutes’ meaning by determining what they will become in practice. Bearing responsibility for the statutory scheme makes agencies more than mechanistic agents of the current Congress, or servants of the sitting president. The statute, after all, belongs to neither. Although scholarship and doctrine often present agencies as working in a fairly clear-cut principal–agent relationship, agency loyalties quickly overflow the discrete, simple vessels thought to contain them.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-140" href="#post-9483-footnote-140">[139]</a></sup> In some sense, we can say that statutes lack much independent meaning; they act as resources whose significance derives largely from how agencies fulfill their duty of care. Our research thus supports Jerry Mashaw’s proposal to “imagine agency statutes as works-in-progress, to be shaped and molded by continuous interaction among the implementing agency, the political branches and affected interests.”<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561727"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-141" href="#post-9483-footnote-141">[140]</a></sup></p>
<p>In emphasizing the pluralism that undergirds agencies’ efforts to create workable policies, we should underscore that influence over their work is not necessarily equally distributed. Even as our interviewees described their efforts to be responsive to the public and to facts on the ground, we cannot discount the well-established reality that economically powerful voices often dominate the conversation with agencies, just as they do with other government institutions.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158452286"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-142" href="#post-9483-footnote-142">[141]</a></sup> But the pluralism we show pervading the policymaking process builds a solid foundation for further democratizing governance. As we explore in Part III, this foundation places agencies in a unique position to keep a statutory scheme relevant and responsive to complex current circumstances, and it pushes them to take into account a broad range of perspectives, claims, and information as they work with statutes.</p>

The Regulated Public &amp; the Regulated World</h3>
<p>Asked how statutory interpretation worked in her agency, one interviewee explained, “I think the answer is . . . it’s not that simple.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-143" href="#post-9483-footnote-143">[142]</a></sup> Rather, this interviewee suggested we consider, “what are the different ways . . . . that acts of statutory interpretation happen.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-144" href="#post-9483-footnote-144">[143]</a></sup> The interviewee noted that “[s]ometimes statutory interpretations come up because something happens on the ground”—for instance, an inspector issues a citation to an industry operator—“and somebody has to make decisions fast, and all of a sudden you wind up with an interpretation.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-145" href="#post-9483-footnote-145">[144]</a></sup> Other times, interpretive issues “come from top-down mandates because somebody’s thinking about a problem.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-146" href="#post-9483-footnote-146">[145]</a></sup> And “sometimes, there’s situations that happen in between, and exactly what those mechanisms will be” depends on the specifics.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-147" href="#post-9483-footnote-147">[146]</a></sup></p>
<p>This interviewee directed our attention to the “ways that statutory interpretive questions come to the [agency].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-148" href="#post-9483-footnote-148">[147]</a></sup> That insight underscored how agencies often turned to their statutes in search of authority to act because events in the world or members of the public catalyzed them to do so. Throughout our interviews, we were given examples of this sort of responsiveness.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-149" href="#post-9483-footnote-149">[148]</a></sup> Real-world events; technological developments; social practices and patterns; and emerging ideas and ideologies all made problems evident and salient: “The drive for a change in a rule or the creation of a rule happens when something bad happens or they are afraid of something bad happening from a health or safety perspective. Then they look at the statute.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-150" href="#post-9483-footnote-150">[149]</a></sup> This central feature of agency action highlights officials’ sense of responsibility to make their statutory regimes work in practice, underscoring how agencies engage with statutes frequently to solve problems and grapple with live issues. It is in this sense that agencies <em>work with</em> their statutes, looking to them as tools to accomplish their objectives, particularly to keep their statutory regime relevant to a changing world.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-151" href="#post-9483-footnote-151">[150]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our interviewees also demonstrated how agencies often develop awareness of the issues they need to address by receiving various forms of feedback from the outside world. “Definitely on the overall policy mandate,” one person observed, “hearing from people doing the work, living under the statutes, regs, [engaging in the regulated activity], dramatically informed our policy, including shifts we made in our own policy over time that were pretty visible and in response to what we were hearing and seeing.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-152" href="#post-9483-footnote-152">[151]</a></sup> Another person explained: “[W]e literally got zillions of questions on a daily basis, like any agency, from people who are trying to interpret what they are supposed to do under the law.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-153" href="#post-9483-footnote-153">[152]</a></sup> Another respondent recalled that “no one really cared about [a particular issue] in terms of the . . . political coalitions . . . in Congress . . . but somehow the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post . . . were obsessed with it.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-154" href="#post-9483-footnote-154">[153]</a></sup> These “editorials often were just like, ‘Hurry up and get the damn thing done,’ rather than, ‘It should have X, Y, and Z.’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-155" href="#post-9483-footnote-155">[154]</a></sup> And “my boss, basically, . . . would see that and say, ‘What’s up? . . . . Let’s try to get this going more quickly.’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-156" href="#post-9483-footnote-156">[155]</a></sup> Pressure, publicity, and novel arguments from the media, interest groups, and regulated parties could push agencies to return to their statutory authorities in search of a response.<a id="post-9483-_Ref156921518"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-157" href="#post-9483-footnote-157">[156]</a></sup></p>
<p>The actual work of superintending a regulatory regime also produced information that gave agency officials motivation to act. Enforcement staff, “always briefing up,” alerted other officials to implementation problems or a lack of fit between regulations and social practices or products.<a id="post-9483-_Ref156674291"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-158" href="#post-9483-footnote-158">[157]</a></sup> As one interviewee noted, with enough uncertainty, “the agency is like, ‘This is a source of confusion, and we need to—our job is supposed to be to provide certainty to the petitioners and applicants’”—to make decisions enabling the agency to say, “[t]his is what the answer is.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-159" href="#post-9483-footnote-159">[158]</a></sup> In one example, a statute provided a reimbursement scale that used rural facilities as a payment floor, on the assumption that rural facilities had relatively fewer resources.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-160" href="#post-9483-footnote-160">[159]</a></sup> Then a highly resourced facility in a low-density area was reclassified as a rural facility. That change would have garnered its state a windfall of several hundred million dollars from a budget shared across all states.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-161" href="#post-9483-footnote-161">[160]</a></sup> Members of Congress from that state lobbied the agency to keep the reclassification.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-162" href="#post-9483-footnote-162">[161]</a></sup> That kind of situation placed the agency between conflicting interpretations and preferences, alerting it to potentially perverse consequences of its decisionmaking.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-163" href="#post-9483-footnote-163">[162]</a></sup></p>
<p>Staff also explained to us how they regularly researched the realities of the practices they regulated. As one subject observed, “We engage in a . . . strategic planning process every year” in which, “from the ground up, the teams survey the trends in the marketplace and figure out where they propose to deploy their limited resources and what are the real problems out there that need to be tackled.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-164" href="#post-9483-footnote-164">[163]</a></sup> As another mused, “One thing that I sort of wondered about is how anyone can do policy, let alone trying to faithfully implement a statutory mandate . . . without having access to really top-flight technical people, because many of the decisions . . . really depend on one’s understanding of the technology.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-165" href="#post-9483-footnote-165">[164]</a></sup></p>
<p>As others have documented, and as we found in our interviews, agencies use a range of approaches to interact directly with regulated parties as they develop policy ideas.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158560840"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-166" href="#post-9483-footnote-166">[165]</a></sup> Many of our respondents described proactive efforts to glean information about issues in the field, the effects of existing rules, and the probable effects of prospective policies from the public.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-167" href="#post-9483-footnote-167">[166]</a></sup> Numerous officials emphasized the importance of “invit[ing] public comment,”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-168" href="#post-9483-footnote-168">[167]</a></sup> holding “listening sessions or round tables” where an agency could “hear[] of the challenges of applying for the program,”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-169" href="#post-9483-footnote-169">[168]</a></sup> and getting input from numerous sources to ensure that agencies were “not advocates just for [particular interests]” but for “the public interest, the sweet spot somewhere in the middle.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-170" href="#post-9483-footnote-170">[169]</a></sup> Such interactions often focused on a policy option’s real-world consequences: “The most useful stuff was . . . when someone in the regulat[ed] community would point out an impact that we hadn’t thought of.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-171" href="#post-9483-footnote-171">[170]</a></sup> As one person put it, “[W]e use a [] multi-layered approach to rule making. . . . We may have a workshop. We may have a round table inviting in stakeholders from all elements. We do this as much to enlighten the staff . . . [as] to make it as open a process as possible.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-172" href="#post-9483-footnote-172">[171]</a></sup> Others might “contract with some polling firms that would do questionnaires or do focus groups of beneficiaries, so we could understand what their challenges were with the [benefits] program” or do “a lot of surveillance activities for us to make sure that the programs are working.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-173" href="#post-9483-footnote-173">[172]</a></sup></p>
<p>Importantly, as we saw in our interviews, much of this work occurs before any legally required notice-and-comment on proposed rulemakings begins.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-174" href="#post-9483-footnote-174">[173]</a></sup> Agencies often develop their policy “drafts” through an interactive, responsive process, in service of their workability objective. Respondents described combing through “various statistical studies or research studies or other policy documents,”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-175" href="#post-9483-footnote-175">[174]</a></sup> “peer review publications, . . . legal opinions” and other “external inputs to help guide and shape” policy consideration.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-176" href="#post-9483-footnote-176">[175]</a></sup> “[I]t typically is an enormous amount of pre-proposal preparatory work. A lot of compiling information. A lot of work [with] the affected industries.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-177" href="#post-9483-footnote-177">[176]</a></sup> As one person recalled, “During the ramp-up to [a particular] rule and during the rulemaking process, I probably met with stakeholders of every stripe, and they, of course, had their own ideas about how the statute ought to be interpreted, so that is a source of information.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-178" href="#post-9483-footnote-178">[177]</a></sup> Often, such interactions, where an agency “tried to listen to a lot of stakeholders,” were not “formal in the sense it was mandated by anything. We just thought it made sense to do.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-179" href="#post-9483-footnote-179">[178]</a></sup></p>
<p>Not every agency engaged in the same level of public consultation. For example, one respondent commented “that a lot of the rulemaking in the immigration space would benefit from some ability, before they spend months and months developing the proposal, to get feedback from stakeholders to understand the unexpected.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-180" href="#post-9483-footnote-180">[179]</a></sup> This political appointee reported being “disappointed” at the lack of such practices.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-181" href="#post-9483-footnote-181">[180]</a></sup> Our research thus accords with others’ findings that, although agencies use a wide variety of agenda-setting public consultation approaches, these efforts “tend to be relatively unstructured, unsystematic, and ad hoc.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-182" href="#post-9483-footnote-182">[181]</a></sup> Moreover, although our research does not allow us to compare the relative influence of different groups, our findings are consistent with studies showing that regulated industry and well-resourced civil-society groups have a greater effect on policy development than smaller public interest groups and ordinary private parties.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-183" href="#post-9483-footnote-183">[182]</a></sup> Nonetheless, our research supports scholarship concluding that many agencies do engage in significant, meaningful public consultation, not just at the agenda-setting stage,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-184" href="#post-9483-footnote-184">[183]</a></sup> but also after a rule’s enactment.<a id="post-9483-_Ref141826825"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-185" href="#post-9483-footnote-185">[184]</a></sup></p>
<p>The formal notice-and-comment process, of course, also brought outside opinions to the agency, and our study respondents painted a picture consistent with others’ conclusions that this aspect of rulemaking influences agency decisionmaking. As one respondent put it: “For a rule of any complexity, it would be very unusual for comments not to result in certain shifts.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-186" href="#post-9483-footnote-186">[185]</a></sup> One agency, for instance, “was in a rush” to make a rule changing a medical reimbursement system “because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee at the time was very interested in” a particular new approach.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-187" href="#post-9483-footnote-187">[186]</a></sup> “[T]he public commenters just were uniformly opposed . . . , and then [the agency] didn’t adopt that system, and then a year later, [the agency] adopted . . . what I thought was a much better system in response to the public comments.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-188" href="#post-9483-footnote-188">[187]</a></sup> Agencies also used comment periods creatively to float policy trial balloons gauging public reaction to a policy option: “[If we were] struggling with the best interpretation or whether we had authority or whatever, . . . we would sometimes directly ask for comments that built out a case for doing something, a statutory theory for doing something” for use in later policymaking.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-189" href="#post-9483-footnote-189">[188]</a></sup> “There were a lot of things where we sort of floated an idea [during a rule-making] . . . , got some stuff that felt useful, and then we were in a position to propose with a stronger . . . record” in a later rulemaking.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-190" href="#post-9483-footnote-190">[189]</a></sup> Agencies can utilize public input in this way by building on existing systems for assessing and responding to comments in rulemaking.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-191" href="#post-9483-footnote-191">[190]</a></sup></p>
<p>Joining our research with the work of others yields a nuanced picture of agencies’ interactions with the public. On the one hand, agency information collection is often unsystematic and inefficient. And agency decisionmaking is often influenced most by well-resourced regulated industries serving their own economic interests. On the other hand, agencies can and often do convene a wide range of participants when formulating policy ideas. And they have personnel and systems in place for taking into account multiple diverse interests. Indeed, their capacity to incorporate and negotiate among pluralistic views in any given policy decision process probably outstrips that of other government institutions. As we discuss further in Part III, strengthening and channeling these pluralistic decisionmaking capacities would significantly enhance government’s democratic quality, a possibility that in turn underscores the serious costs of the current presidential administration’s efforts to dismantle bureaucratic capacity, as well as of recent Supreme Court doctrine that has been redistributing decisionmaking power to the far less accountable federal courts.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-192" href="#post-9483-footnote-192">[191]</a></sup></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Our interviewees consistently underscored that agency action often requires a catalyst—something that drives an agency to designate some phenomenon as a problem that warrants a policy response.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561631"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-193" href="#post-9483-footnote-193">[192]</a></sup> To a large extent, statutes leave it up to agencies to decide whether to address—and how to even identify—an issue under their purview. Presidential administrations and congressional oversight of course play significant roles in setting agencies’ overall regulatory agendas, especially in the modern context of centralized review.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-194" href="#post-9483-footnote-194">[193]</a></sup> But throughout our interviews, officials described an ongoing, ground-up form of working with statutes, grounded in their evaluation of workability. Our study thus shows how working with a statute intrinsically involves figuring out the real-world consequences of different implementation options, ensuring that decisions express not just theoretical preferences but workable goals so that the agency can effectively implement its policy choices.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-195" href="#post-9483-footnote-195">[194]</a></sup> An agency’s purposes and goals were often pragmatically, not abstractly, defined.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-196" href="#post-9483-footnote-196">[195]</a></sup> Interviewees were keenly aware that agencies do not act on their own: “Like a quarterback can throw the ball down the field, but better have someone [to] catch it.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-197" href="#post-9483-footnote-197">[196]</a></sup> As we will explore in Part III, this consequentialist orientation comfortably suits an institution of governance in a democracy by helping to ensure that governance decisions are made not just in the abstract or on principle, but with due consideration for their effects on the governed population.</p>

(Members of) Congress</h3>
<p>In scholarly literature, judicial doctrine, and common parlance, agencies play the role of Congress’s delegee. At the most basic level, when Congress legislates, the relevant agency springs into action. As put by one interviewee, a statute “was signed into law [on] December 15, and we started talking about regulating the next day.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-198" href="#post-9483-footnote-198">[197]</a></sup> From another: When statutes impose schedules, “we get started immediately.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-199" href="#post-9483-footnote-199">[198]</a></sup></p>
<p>But agencies have complex, internally cross-cutting relations even with the seemingly single institution of Congress. First and foremost, the delegating or enacting Congress—and the governing coalition behind a statute—quickly recede into history after the next biennial election.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-200" href="#post-9483-footnote-200">[199]</a></sup> The bulk of agency work thus entails statutes enacted by past Congresses, even as that work is overseen and enabled by later Congresses, including through ongoing appropriations.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-201" href="#post-9483-footnote-201">[200]</a></sup> As we note in Part I, agencies balance their desire to “get along with Congress” with their duty of loyalty to a statutory regime that may well predate sitting lawmakers: “[Y]ou’re trying to be . . . a good steward to the program and adhere to the statute.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-202" href="#post-9483-footnote-202">[201]</a></sup> Though our respondents identified and understood the preferences of existing members of Congress, they distinguished those from the imperatives of their statutes. “We kind of knew that [Congress was not] gonna be happy with us,” one official said of a particular program.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-203" href="#post-9483-footnote-203">[202]</a></sup> “We kind of knew that they were probably against it because either my Program Office or General Counsel had had at least some conversation with the committee . . . . But we felt we had authority anyway. So we went ahead and did it.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-204" href="#post-9483-footnote-204">[203]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our respondents’ identification of the tensions between Congresses highlights that a critical component of their duty of care—making statutory regimes workable—involves collaborating with and responding to sitting lawmakers. Throughout our study, officials articulated their efforts to incorporate congressional demands alongside their own understandings of what their statutory regime required of them. These forms of influence were diverse: From pressure and lobbying by individual members of Congress, to consultation with oversight and appropriations committees, to negotiation and joint problem-solving, the sitting Congress helps shape statutory meaning.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158459051"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-205" href="#post-9483-footnote-205">[204]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although our interviewees were attuned to Congress’s legislative powers writ large, the lower-level, individualistic influence they frequently cited resembled collaboration or competition, rather than the principal–agent relationship often attributed to the separation of powers or delegation at high levels of generality.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-206" href="#post-9483-footnote-206">[205]</a></sup> Scholars such as Christopher Walker and Jarrod Shobe have documented how agency officials provide technical assistance to legislative drafters, reflecting the value of the agencies’ expertise to the lawmaking process.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158458805"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-207" href="#post-9483-footnote-207">[206]</a></sup> This collaboration works the other way, too. Members of Congress provide inputs into a multifarious decisionmaking process with agencies, though members’ authority or political preferences, rather than expertise, shape such “assistance.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-208" href="#post-9483-footnote-208">[207]</a></sup> As one interviewee put it, when members of Congress lobbied their agency to adopt some particular view of a statutory provision, “we would certainly take it under advisement whether we could do it or not, whether we thought it made sense of what we’re trying to accomplish, and whether it could be done legally with all the issues that we’d have to evaluate.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-209" href="#post-9483-footnote-209">[208]</a></sup> In the end, though, the statute took primacy: If some option is not “permissible in terms of certain things that maybe certain members of Congress want you to do, you just have to deal with it and say, ‘The law is the law here. There’s not much more we can do. Basically, you wrote a crappy law and we’re stuck with it.’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-210" href="#post-9483-footnote-210">[209]</a></sup></p>
<p>Officials’ sense of responsibility for effectuating statutes over time, even in the face of opposition from later Congresses, was probably bolstered by administrators’ relative expertise in the statutory regime itself. Members of Congress are fundamentally generalists, while agency employees specialize in the statutes their agency implements, with divisions of labor inside the agency supporting specialization. “I don’t think any of the members of Congress—maybe some of the staff, [but] none of the members of Congress—that I talked to had read the statute. They plainly did not have . . . detailed familiarity with what the statute said . . . or what our brief under the statute was.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-211" href="#post-9483-footnote-211">[210]</a></sup> Instead, discussions with Congress as reported by our respondents tended to be “much more general, which is, ‘Yeah, we want to [protect individuals from harms by an industry,] but we don’t want to kill the [industry]. How are you going to do that?’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-212" href="#post-9483-footnote-212">[211]</a></sup> Accordingly, our subjects often described members of Congress as less focused on particular (and likely unfamiliar) statutory text than on the practical implications of agency action.</p>
<p>The extent of officials’ interactions with members of Congress varied significantly among our interviewees. A small agency with little direct regulatory power “would be in touch with Congress before [it] decided whether to move forward on a particular action, like in the yes or no stage,” while “we were developing the policy itself, and . . . as appropriate when we were developing the regulatory language . . . . So we’d be in touch with them at every stage through till the end.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-213" href="#post-9483-footnote-213">[212]</a></sup> These interactions would involve “the leadership of the [Oversight] Committee, . . . Democratic and Republican staff. And to some degree with the individual members’ staff who had a particular interest in the issue.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-214" href="#post-9483-footnote-214">[213]</a></sup> Another interviewee described some collaborative problem solving: “There are certain areas where Congress passed laws that frankly were almost impossible to implement, like the 100% screening requirement for cargo entering the United States.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-215" href="#post-9483-footnote-215">[214]</a></sup> The relevant agencies had “gotten waivers from Congress year after year after year, just because it hasn’t been possible [to implement] for resource reasons, for all kinds of technical reasons.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-216" href="#post-9483-footnote-216">[215]</a></sup> That led to creative negotiation with members of Congress: “If we’re going to do something to try and meet your goal on an interim basis, would <em>this</em> satisfy the committee?”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-217" href="#post-9483-footnote-217">[216]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other respondents described situations in which “executive agencies hav[e] some reluctance to maybe allow Congress into the process, because their motivations were not necessarily the same as [the agency’s].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-218" href="#post-9483-footnote-218">[217]</a></sup> For instance, an interviewee discussed a statute requiring the agency to “designate specific airports for [particular kinds of arrival screening].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-219" href="#post-9483-footnote-219">[218]</a></sup> The law, which had been enacted decades earlier, evinced “no idea that you could have some kind of electronic submission of information for advanced screening at a central place,” so technological developments had made that law “out of date.” <sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-220" href="#post-9483-footnote-220">[219]</a></sup> But it still had an economic impact: Designated airports could benefit from increased commerce.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-221" href="#post-9483-footnote-221">[220]</a></sup> As U.S. foreign policy changed, “members of Congress were jockeying to . . . designate certain airports [under the statute] . . . , for purely economic and commercial reasons.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-222" href="#post-9483-footnote-222">[221]</a></sup> The interviewee recalled, “[W]e’d look at them like they were aliens, like, ‘We’re sitting here trying to find a way to [improve screening for national security], and you’re going to try and use this old security law to force us to put it at your airport?’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-223" href="#post-9483-footnote-223">[222]</a></sup> For agency officials, orienting their action around the statutory scheme provided a way to confront <em>congressional </em>capture by commercial interests or narrow constituencies.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158574645"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-224" href="#post-9483-footnote-224">[223]</a></sup></p>
<p>That orientation also influenced how administrators interacted with individual members of Congress. “[I]t was very, very common,” one long-term administrator told us, that “Congress would enact some piece of legislation and maybe . . . [some legislators] were dissatisfied with what they drafted, and they wanted to do a . . . [p]ost-enactment reinterpretation of what they wanted . . . .”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-225" href="#post-9483-footnote-225">[224]</a></sup> This interviewee recalled a statute drafted to exclude a certain class of entity from public cost reporting—an exclusion designed to create cost savings. “I know [the statute was supposed to do] that because I was assisting the people who were drafting the bill and [were] trying [to] make sure the criteria would exclude [that kind of entity].”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-226" href="#post-9483-footnote-226">[225]</a></sup> These entities first learned about their exclusion late, when “the language couldn’t be changed.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-227" href="#post-9483-footnote-227">[226]</a></sup> They “went complaining to” two Senators, who “had this colloquy on the floor to say” that the entities should be included in cost reporting after all.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-228" href="#post-9483-footnote-228">[227]</a></sup> That kind of colloquy, our respondent emphasized, “has zero meaning. . . . The agency can’t go based on what two Senators say on the floor of the Senate one month after the bill was enacted, in place of the . . . statutory language . . . . The agency is obligated to implement the statutory language that is passed by Congress.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-229" href="#post-9483-footnote-229">[228]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars have found that congressional oversight hearings can “mov[e agency action] towards congressional preferences on issues ranging from the level of regulatory enforcement to the creation of programs that stretch agencies’ statutory authority.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-230" href="#post-9483-footnote-230">[229]</a></sup> Appropriations committees can also exert significant influence.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-231" href="#post-9483-footnote-231">[230]</a></sup> Our respondents, however, did not recount all that much experience with congressional hearings. It may be that our respondents, many of whom were civil servants, were not closely connected to the leadership offices or offices of legislative affairs that would have dealt with oversight hearings on a regular basis. But the lack of discussion of oversight hearings could also reflect the fact that such hearings themselves are not the norm; hearings require a political choice on the part of members of Congress, somewhat costly in terms of “time constraints[,] opportunity costs, [and] informational demands.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-232" href="#post-9483-footnote-232">[231]</a></sup> Either way, our study supports the conclusion that agency officials formulating policy and overseeing programs consider the views of members of the sitting Congress. But our research also suggests that officials incorporate congressional input to enhance the workability of their statutory regimes, giving primacy not to the opinions of particular legislators, but to what those statutory regimes require.</p>

Presidential Administrations</h3>
<p>Political officials—the President, Cabinet secretaries, and the thousands of political appointees across the Executive Branch—play an important role in shaping how statutes work. We conducted our study well before the current presidential administration launched its radical efforts to control and remake the bureaucracy, and the conclusions we offer here do not account for the dramatic expansion of centralized control and apparent rejection of numerous statutory contraints currently underway. But our research does demonstrate that achieving workability long has required agencies to attend to the priorities and values of the political officials installed within agency leadership, as well as the directives, pressure, or requests for assistance that might come from the White House and the Executive Office of the President (EOP). After all, much of an agency’s actual decisionmaking authority rests in the hands of political officials. And regardless of the extent to which the President and White House can and should control agency action, EOP support remains vital to the success of many agency policies, including because of the entrenched practices of centralized OMB and OIRA review. That political officials’ priorities influence policymaking also demonstrates a form of democratic responsiveness within administration, allowing elections to have consequences. This influence can contribute to public acceptance and democratic legitimation—important aspects of workability, too.</p>
<p>Our interviews illuminate how the political layer that governs agencies shapes the production of statutory regimes. In describing this relationship here, we draw on other work, based on the same dataset, in which we analyze this set of political connections.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-233" href="#post-9483-footnote-233">[232]</a></sup> That work identifies three key features of the role political actors play in agencies’ work with statutes. First, the White House and the EOP play important, though hardly all-encompassing, roles in shaping agency policymaking. An administration may seek to centralize the implementation of a signature initiative within the EOP—a signal feature of the Obama administration’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act. <sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-234" href="#post-9483-footnote-234">[233]</a></sup> But, more often than not, White House involvement in agency policymaking is not “a top-down process displacing agency judgment . . . but rather . . . a collaborative and participatory process.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-235" href="#post-9483-footnote-235">[234]</a></sup> Interviewees described White House attention not as demanding specific outcomes, but as requiring exhaustive consideration, explanation, and documentation from regulators.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-236" href="#post-9483-footnote-236">[235]</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, the transmission of presidential priorities across the state does not typically come from clear pronouncements by the President himself. In practice, presidential influence tends to be diffuse and general rather than direct or specific.<a id="post-9483-_Ref141825855"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-237" href="#post-9483-footnote-237">[236]</a></sup> It is really more appropriate to speak in terms of <em>political </em>rather than <em>presidential </em>control, as the influence of an administration depends a great deal on the particular priorities of the political officials who occupy positions of authority within agencies<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-238" href="#post-9483-footnote-238">[237]</a></sup> and who enter office with their own policy ideas and personal backgrounds, connected to a thick network of political operatives, civil-society groups, and other sources.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-239" href="#post-9483-footnote-239">[238]</a></sup></p>
<p>And third, even though such officials play important and granular agenda-setting and decisionmaking roles, they have a complex and often collaborative relationship with career civil servants, who themselves draw on their experience with their statutes to evaluate what policies might be necessary or appropriate and what might be accomplished given the political context.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-240" href="#post-9483-footnote-240">[239]</a></sup> We have described the relationship between “politicals” and “careers” as integrating different, complementary epistemic orientations, each necessary in the policymaking process.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-241" href="#post-9483-footnote-241">[240]</a></sup> Much as with congressional influence, agency officials exercising their duty of care seek to reconcile the policy priorities of the current political apparatus with their loyalty to statutory regimes. As we emphasized in Part I, those priorities are themselves shaped and even constrained by a longer standing values orientation embodied in the concept of agency mission.</p>
<p>Our findings ultimately suggest that presidentialist theories misapprehend the President’s actual role in policy development.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-242" href="#post-9483-footnote-242">[241]</a></sup> Given the complexity of agency work with statutes and the practical limitations on presidential involvement, these theories likely overstate how much even a determined President could plausibly direct regulatory action across the breadth of the administrative state.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-243" href="#post-9483-footnote-243">[242]</a></sup> But presidential administrations, and the intricate coordination they produce between political officials and civil servants who both pre- and post-date them, heavily shape the course of statutory regimes.</p>

Courts, Litigation, and Litigation Risk</h3>
<p>Most of administrative law concerns the judicial review of agency action, and most scholarship concerning judicial review takes courts as the starting point: Commentators ask how courts should, and do, evaluate agency decisionmaking, and sometimes consider how legal doctrines interact with, and even impede, responsible policymaking.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561793"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-244" href="#post-9483-footnote-244">[243]</a></sup> Our study illuminates a different and typically ignored perspective on judicial review: agency officials’ own conceptions of courts as decisionmakers and authority figures.</p>
<p>Nearly all of our subjects, when discussing courts and court doctrine, made clear that calculating “litigation risk” was integral to policymaking. Our interviewees functioned within the palimpsest of legal doctrine built up by courts over time.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-245" href="#post-9483-footnote-245">[244]</a></sup> But officials described to us that they related to doctrine strategically. They did not receive judicial pronouncements as articulating “correct” meanings, but as factors with which they had to contend to get their work done. Whether agency action ends up in court, and whether a court will uphold it, are probabilistic inquiries; many respondents explained how they sought to make these predictions as they went along, shaping statutory implementation in a judicial image. Potential litigation “was always a consideration” in policymaking: Administrators asked “what’s the probability of litigation, and what’s the probability that the federal government would prevail?”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-246" href="#post-9483-footnote-246">[245]</a></sup> Tolerance for litigation risks varied considerably across agencies and individuals,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-247" href="#post-9483-footnote-247">[246]</a></sup> but considering the possibility of litigation was clearly a normal part of working with statutes.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-248" href="#post-9483-footnote-248">[247]</a></sup> As one interviewee put it, “[J]ust part of my DNA at this point, is, I’ve got to ask the question, ‘Well, what happens if we get sued on this? And how do we defend it?’”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-249" href="#post-9483-footnote-249">[248]</a></sup></p>
<p>Agencies’ relationship to judicial review is bound up with their pursuit of workability: Producing workable statutory regimes requires staying within the parameters set by evolving judicial doctrine and behavior. As one interviewee put it: “I guess the takeaway . . . is court filings are also a way that policy gets made.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-250" href="#post-9483-footnote-250">[249]</a></sup> This finding does not mean that all or even most agency action ends up in court; in fact, we think it likely that large swaths of final agency action are truly final. But the design of judicial review under the APA and relevant case law ensures that agency policymaking occurs in the shadow of litigation. Working with a statute thus requires being ready to translate the agency’s reasoning for courts. “[W]hen you’re in the rulemaking, you’re looking at things in a much more holistic way . . . . [W]hen you’re defending it in court, you’re having to take a more strategic perspective in understanding what the predilections are of the court before which you’re arguing.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-251" href="#post-9483-footnote-251">[250]</a></sup> This imperative pushed agencies to create thorough administrative records that made a policy “defensible” in court.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-252" href="#post-9483-footnote-252">[251]</a></sup> Even “[o]n technical issues, the ultimate judge . . . will be a federal judge. So I would want to make sure, not only had we explained in a way that a non-technical person like me or a federal judge could understand,” but also “that all significant comments be . . . answered in a manner that really deals with their efforts.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-253" href="#post-9483-footnote-253">[252]</a></sup></p>
<p>The effects of litigation could also linger long past the court’s decision, reinforcing the importance of calculating litigation risk with accuracy.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-254" href="#post-9483-footnote-254">[253]</a></sup> As one official put it, “[W]hen an agency has lost a bunch of cases under a statutory provision, when a question, even a new question, comes up under that provision, the lawyers are very anxious about losing more.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-255" href="#post-9483-footnote-255">[254]</a></sup> This position made sense, the official explained, because “they felt like they are repeat players in front of the D.C. Circuit.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-256" href="#post-9483-footnote-256">[255]</a></sup> Our subjects frequently described failure in court as a blow to an agency’s reputation, credibility, and ability to get things done.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-257" href="#post-9483-footnote-257">[256]</a></sup> A bad litigation result could hang over an agency for a long time, affecting the way participants made policy decisions down the line—post-traumatic effects that could linger even when participants were skeptical of the court’s results.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158289094"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-258" href="#post-9483-footnote-258">[257]</a></sup></p>
<p>But as a number of our interviewees also expressed, translating their work for courts was not always straightforward. Part of the challenge of litigation risk assessment arose because courts could be inconsistent, unpredictable, and opportunistic. As one person expressed it,</p>
<p>[C]ourts always are invoking these . . . rules and statutory constructions but . . . to my mind, at least personally, you know, it’s kind of a result-oriented application. You know, there’s no principle of statutory construction that we’re trying to uphold. It’s the opposite. We’re trying to use the statutory principles, the statutory construction to uphold the purpose of [the statute].<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-259" href="#post-9483-footnote-259">[258]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the words of another, “I can’t find any particular consistency. When courts like our stuff, they just go through it. When they don’t, they don’t.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-260" href="#post-9483-footnote-260">[259]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the actual assessment of litigation risk, an agency’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) loomed large. Many of our interviewees described their reliance on their lawyerly hubs for guidance on the risk/reward tradeoff of policymaking. As one non-attorney told us about sub-regulatory guidance, “Are we thinking about litigation when we write the guidance? No, I think we’re thinking about offering a blueprint [for regulated parties], but the Office of General Counsel is looking at it and saying, okay, what could come back to haunt us.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-261" href="#post-9483-footnote-261">[260]</a></sup> As another interviewee explained, OGC’s risk assessment might then occasion negotiation with and among subject-matter experts about whether it was worth proceeding with the planned policy. “It’s hard to say who decided in those cases ’cause we would . . . talk about it for a long time, and eventually someone would back down. So, if [OGC thought] something carried a lot [of] litigation risk, then they would continue saying that . . . , and we would move towards a decision.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-262" href="#post-9483-footnote-262">[261]</a></sup></p>
<p>Across interviews, our subjects identified one judicial doctrine as especially relevant to their risk assessments: the now-overruled framework established by <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council </em>to govern review of agency interpretations of statutes. Though lawyers were more likely to describe <em>Chevron</em>’s two steps with doctrinal precision,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-263" href="#post-9483-footnote-263">[262]</a></sup> nearly all officials whom we asked about the role of judicial doctrine knew the case by name and understood that courts sometimes defer to agency conclusions.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-264" href="#post-9483-footnote-264">[263]</a></sup> Officials described <em>Chevron </em>as enabling their pursuit of policy goals, or as something agencies “rel[y] on in order to promote the purposes of their mission. You know, the purposes of the Act that they’re tasked with administering and enforcing.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-265" href="#post-9483-footnote-265">[264]</a></sup> As another official put it: “<em>Chevron </em>gives a lot of policy discretion, and that’s really the job of the political people, that’s their role. The role of staff attorney would be to indicate what the permissible parameters for making the decision would be.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-266" href="#post-9483-footnote-266">[265]</a></sup></p>
<p>While some officials described using <em>Chevron </em>to remind courts of their proper place,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-267" href="#post-9483-footnote-267">[266]</a></sup> the doctrine hardly translated into a view that “anything goes” in the face of statutory ambiguity: As one respondent summarized, “We have to have a reason.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-268" href="#post-9483-footnote-268">[267]</a></sup> One official emphasized that <em>Chevron</em> was relevant only in a small class of cases involving “meatier appeals.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-269" href="#post-9483-footnote-269">[268]</a></sup> Another even described <em>Chevron </em>as irrelevant, because the agency’s job was “try[ing] to do it right.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-270" href="#post-9483-footnote-270">[269]</a></sup> Others, moreover, expressed a critical perspective on courts’ use of <em>Chevron</em>, suggesting that a court’s application of the doctrine could be a function of its views on the agency’s policy itself.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-271" href="#post-9483-footnote-271">[270]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond its strategic dimension, litigation also appeared to offer our subjects a learning opportunity, independent of courts’ final decisions. Some of our interviewees described litigation as pushing the agency to reconsider its approach.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-272" href="#post-9483-footnote-272">[271]</a></sup> Where a regulated party behaves in ways not foreseen by a regulation or makes arguments the agency did not anticipate, the agency (and potentially the DOJ) must develop a response. One attorney described a situation “where an [industry] operator has raised a legitimate interpretive question, or sort of real-world question about what our interpretation means, and we’re kind of trying to interact with [the policy making part of the agency] about, ‘Is this really a position you want us to defend?,’” or “Is there guidance that you want to put out that would sort of preserve our interpretation but handle the particular troublesome problem that the operator has raised?”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-273" href="#post-9483-footnote-273">[272]</a></sup> Another interviewee described a situation in which the agency “delved deeper into the regulatory provisions than perhaps we did when we were drafting them, because the litigants were in some measure raising arguments that we hadn’t encountered before.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-274" href="#post-9483-footnote-274">[273]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our respondents’ accounts of their experiences with litigation ultimately highlighted the costs and benefits of judicial review itself. The prospect of litigation, not to mention court invalidation, might impede an agency from performing its custodial role by dissuading it from acting on a statutory provision, particularly if officials’ risk assessment turns to risk aversion, or where lawyers play a particularly heavy-handed role in policy vetting. We might in fact worry that recent doctrinal developments will contribute to such aversion. Agencies must continue interpreting statutes as part of their statutory responsibilities. But the combination of <em>Chevron</em>’s end with the recent supercharging of the major questions doctrine that post-dated our interviews does seem likely to produce greater risk aversion and therefore less policymaking generally, whether or not grounded in novel uses of statutes. Understanding the implications of the Roberts Court’s administrative law precedents is certainly a vital subject for future research, including of the sort we present here.</p>
<p>But litigation, and the assessment of litigation risk, can also turn into a form of public participation in policymaking, underscoring one conventional account of the judicial review provisions of the APA—that they enable public monitoring of agencies through litigants’ identification of policy flaws.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-275" href="#post-9483-footnote-275">[274]</a></sup> Litigation can alert agencies when regulations might not cohere with reality or with other policies, and provide another way for affected publics to push regulators to take their views into account. Examples like those we heard in our interviews highlight agencies’ intimate connections to the world they regulate and the pragmatic, problem-solving nature of agencies’ work with statutes. Agency officials thus develop strategies for avoiding and surviving contest in the courts; in the process, they negotiate among the competing demands expressed in litigation. These negotiations occur as part of their duty to produce workable statutory regimes.</p>
<h2><a id="post-9483-_Toc158623610"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708826"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158708845"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712160"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737890"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339786"></a> III. Implications</h2>
<p>Our empirical findings support the contention that agencies act as their statutes’ custodians, managing the ongoing effectuation of statutes over their life cycles, which may last decades. <a id="post-9483-_Ref158288145"></a>We show how, in performing this role, agency officials understand themselves to possess duties of loyalty and care: a duty to act in service of the statutory regime, which in turn yields a duty to implement the statute in a workable fashion. Officials draw on an enduring yet evolving sense of mission to reconcile changing and conflicting circumstances, interests, and values, ameliorating the dead hand problem posed by old statutes that nonetheless continue to govern the public.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158570958"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-276" href="#post-9483-footnote-276">[275]</a></sup> As part of this reconciliation, officials negotiate among divergent interests and values at any given point in time, incorporating diverse political and institutional considerations into particular policy decisions. Agencies are thus in a position to ensure that a statute passed by democratic coalitions of the past remains viable over time, at the same time that officials account for the evolving circumstances of the people governed by the statute in the present.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158283969"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-277" href="#post-9483-footnote-277">[276]</a></sup> Pluralistic decisionmaking along these two dimensions—what we might call the historical and the sociological—helps keep an agency from becoming a tool of rule in the hands of any one political participant.</p>
<p>In the course of doing this work, agencies may well make mistakes, perform ineffectively, overlook the interests of the non-monied and disadvantaged, or privilege organized interests over the diffuse public. But our work suggests that, despite these shortcomings, enervating agency discretion and capacity, as the sitting Supreme Court doctrine and the current presidential administration both seem set on doing, would actually undermine crucial functions of our system of government. Our findings thus have important implications for legal scholarship, the study of democratic institutions, and doctrinal and political debates over the scope and future of the administrative state. This research also helps us to identify how agencies can be made better, more accountable institutions.</p>

<p>Most narrowly, our findings should influence legal scholarship on statutory interpretation, which traditionally has taken the perspective of courts and focused primarily on the judicial review of agency decisions.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-278" href="#post-9483-footnote-278">[277]</a></sup> While more recent research has gone further afield to study agency interpretation itself, inquiries in this area still have a largely juricentric orientation.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-279" href="#post-9483-footnote-279">[278]</a></sup> Scholars have asked whether agency statutory interpretation does or should resemble textualism or purposivism, or examined how much administrators know about, and follow, such judicial tenets and canons of interpretation.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-280" href="#post-9483-footnote-280">[279]</a></sup> Our Article poses a different set of questions focused on how agencies understand what they are supposed to be doing with statutes. Our effort to answer these questions helps bring to light a set of political and legal practices that are crucial to understanding how law is given effect in the world—practices influenced but hardly determined by (and sometimes inconsistent with) those of courts.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-281" href="#post-9483-footnote-281">[280]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rather than seeking an abstract or semantic vantage onto statutory meanings, agencies use statutes to address issues or problems. They treat statutes as enactments meant to create effects. Our interviewees described agencies as responsible for the consequences of their actions; policy consequences thus become central to officials’ consideration of statutes. This practical orientation contrasts sharply with, for instance, textualism, which generally rejects basing statutory interpretation on its likely real-world effects.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-282" href="#post-9483-footnote-282">[281]</a></sup> As agencies work to address the issues that come up in their statutory sphere of concern, the statute serves simultaneously as prod, constraint, and resource—combining with other resources such as a sense of mission, diverse public inputs, real-world circumstances, legislative pressures, and presidential preferences. The measure of success is not semantic correlation so much as the production of effective solutions to problems that a statute lays at the agency’s feet. It is the agency’s job, our interviewees made clear, to make statutory mandates effective, coherent, and implementable. This concern recognizes that practical implications are what make a statute a force in the world. One might even say that consequences constitute the statute.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that textualism and purposivism, with their attendant canons and rules, are simply not that helpful for understanding how agencies work with statutes. Our interviewees certainly considered both texts and purposes, often in differentiated ways depending on their agencies’ internal divisions of labor. But text and purpose were just two factors of many, some of which the prescriptive theories do not recognize and cannot account for.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-283" href="#post-9483-footnote-283">[282]</a></sup> Courts’ interpretive theories are tied up with the countermajoritarian difficulty, and their canons of interpretation rest on (often inaccurate) heuristics about the legislative process.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-284" href="#post-9483-footnote-284">[283]</a></sup> Agencies, authorized by statutory delegations and intimately familiar with legislative production, have other concerns. Even interviewees familiar with judicial tenets did not claim to be guided by them, except to the extent adherence to those tenets might prove necessary to ensure that agency policy could withstand judicial review: These tenets do not help agencies address the issues that statutes place within their purview. As our discussion suggests, agencies cannot accurately be described as textualist, purposivist, or an eclectic mix of the two. They do something different that needs to be studied on its own terms. Indeed, our agency-focused perspective ultimately gives us insight into what goes on inside the bureaucracy and how statutory enactments come to have effects—insights necessary to any efforts to enhance agency accountability and crucial for evaluating the separation of powers and the demands of modern government.</p>
<p>As we elaborate in more detail below, we think the juricentric view that treats courts as the decisive players in giving the law meaning actually ignores the dictates of Congress, which depend on agencies to give statutes effects in the world.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-285" href="#post-9483-footnote-285">[284]</a></sup> To give Congress its proper place in statutory effectuation and to recognize the realities of agency practice, we propose reorienting the discussion. <em>Pace </em>the Roberts Court, our work shows that grasping the meaning of a statute—understanding what it asks agencies to do—is not a purely legal question. Scholarship should not start with the way courts <em>interpret</em> statutes—a phrasing that itself evokes an abstract, semantic, cognitive understanding. Rather, scholars should start by focusing on how agencies <em>work with</em> statutes: how agencies convene multiple institutional participants to produce a workable plan for addressing issues within a statute’s domain. Freed from inapposite categories of judicial justification, this orientation clears a place to explore how agencies—and statutes—actually work in our democracy. From that point of view, we can then engage and evaluate interpretation by courts.</p>
<p>Even for juricentric scholarship, our insights should raise new questions. It may well be that certain judicial models or theories are preferable to the practices we have uncovered, or that courts should continue what they’re doing irrespective of what we learn about how agencies work with statutes. Perhaps the limited accountability and policy expertise of courts makes them uniquely ill-suited to engage in the sort of consequentialist decisionmaking we have described. But as we explore in more detail in subpart III(C) below, that assumption would still be compatible with (and might even require) deferential judicial review. To some readers with a more juricentric orientation, the divergence we document might suggest that it is agencies that should change. But why should we assume that courts and their particular methods of discerning statutory meaning hold pride of place in interpreting statutes that Congress charges agencies with effectuating? The courts’ divergence from agency models demands justification.</p>
<p>In its recent decision overruling <em>Chevron</em>, the Court provides an answer to this demand—interpreting statutes is just what courts do, they answer <em>legal</em> questions. But this observation is entirely conclusory, and our work shows why effectuating statutes by giving meaning to their texts cannot be reduced to acontextual “legal” question answering. Scholars need not make the same baseless assumptions as the Roberts Court—that agencies have no special expertise in interpreting statutes. It is arguably a burden of the juricentric scholar to explain why courts rather than agencies should play the leading role in ensuring that congressional will has been followed. No matter how hard the Supreme Court insists that agencies have no expertise when it comes to interpreting statutes, agency officials will continue doing so—their job within our system of government requires it.</p>

<p>As we have emphasized throughout this Article, our research shows how agency work with statutes helps ameliorate the inherent tension between continuity and change in our democracy. In this subpart we spell out the comparative institutional advantage of relying on agencies to play this role. And once we understand agencies as sites for a particular sort of democratic action, we are in a better position to evaluate how well our system of separation of powers is working, to improve the practices of government and the efficacy of statutes, and to articulate the proper scope for judicial review of agency action.</p>
<p>As we have noted throughout, like any institution, agencies do their work imperfectly.<a id="post-9483-_Ref156028845"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-286" href="#post-9483-footnote-286">[285]</a></sup> Many struggle to incorporate the full range of relevant interests in their deliberations.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-287" href="#post-9483-footnote-287">[286]</a></sup> Industry and other powerful players regularly have the loudest say.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-288" href="#post-9483-footnote-288">[287]</a></sup> Agency action can ignore or even harm the interests of marginalized and disempowered groups.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158280393"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-289" href="#post-9483-footnote-289">[288]</a></sup> As with similar features of our other governing institutions,<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-290" href="#post-9483-footnote-290">[289]</a></sup> these limitations demand attention and amelioration. But it also becomes especially important to consider how agencies compare to other such institutions available to do the historical and sociological work we have described.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-291" href="#post-9483-footnote-291">[290]</a></sup> We offer this “comparative institutional analysis” to help reveal our institutions’ relative abilities and to identify efficacious ways to bolster the system’s democratic qualities.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-292" href="#post-9483-footnote-292">[291]</a></sup> Taking this systemic perspective, our research suggests that agencies play a central, and quite likely the primary, role in keeping statutes relevant and responsive.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-293" href="#post-9483-footnote-293">[292]</a></sup> We have shown not only how statutes represent “works-in-progress,” rather than fixed meanings, but also how their development requires shaping by agencies through interaction with “the political branches and affected interests.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-294" href="#post-9483-footnote-294">[293]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many critics of <em>Chevron </em>deference, and of contemporary administration more generally, insist that Congress itself should, and can, update statutes to address evolving circumstances.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-295" href="#post-9483-footnote-295">[294]</a></sup> But the work we have shown agencies performing makes them necessary complements to congressional action. Congress does engage with agencies as they work with statutes, through its committees and individual members.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-296" href="#post-9483-footnote-296">[295]</a></sup> Still, such congressional participation cannot be regarded as authoritative;<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-297" href="#post-9483-footnote-297">[296]</a></sup> treating it as relevant but not dispositive, as our interviewees did, seems appropriate.</p>
<p>More importantly, we think it both unrealistic and undesirable to demand that Congress constantly legislate anew. Such a burden would quickly outstrip congressional capacity and exceed the limits of a reasonable legislative agenda.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-298" href="#post-9483-footnote-298">[297]</a></sup> Members of Congress are generalists with limited staffs facing regular elections while governing an enormously complex economy and society.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158191213"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-299" href="#post-9483-footnote-299">[298]</a></sup> Congress as a whole lacks the diversified expertise of the agencies it creates.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-300" href="#post-9483-footnote-300">[299]</a></sup> Individual members of Congress, concerned with their geographic constituencies or donors, lack both the incentives and the institutional capacity to undertake the kind of broad consultation characteristic of agency work.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-301" href="#post-9483-footnote-301">[300]</a></sup> Our findings suggest that several key features of agencies—specified focus, divisions of labor, multiple ongoing communication channels, and attenuated dependence on elections—allow them to engage in ongoing policy development through deliberation and interaction with relevant parties and publics in a way that Congress and its members simply cannot. Agencies thus possess a clear comparative advantage when addressing day-to-day problems and evolving demands for government action. We can, of course, point to instances in which new legislation would be far more effective at addressing novel challenges than regulation under old statutes. But that does not mean that Congress can or should legislate each time change is required. To base a theory of administrative power on that assumption is glib at best.</p>
<p>Critics of agency power also make a related claim: that agency decisionmaking is undemocratic and therefore must be circumscribed. Justices of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about agencies’ role in a government of separated powers, decrying administrative “edicts” as enforcing “unbounded policy choices,” or painting the administrative state as a rule-free zone where agencies issue commands at whim.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-302" href="#post-9483-footnote-302">[301]</a></sup> Others impugn agencies for privileging the technocratic expertise of unelected bureaucrats, undermining Congress’s democratic will.<a id="post-9483-_Ref187666432"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-303" href="#post-9483-footnote-303">[302]</a></sup> As we have discussed at length elsewhere, our research shows how these criticisms are misplaced, underscoring that such claims are often motivated by a suspicion of regulation generally.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561827"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-304" href="#post-9483-footnote-304">[303]</a></sup> The characterization of agency action as despotic bears little resemblance to the working world our interviewees described; the myriad dimensions of the duty of care underscore the deliberative, responsive, and consultative nature of agency work.</p>
<p>Critics of agencies’ role in a government of separated powers must also confront the fact that delegation to agencies embodies the choice of the legislature itself. Delegation is the means by which a sitting Congress projects its democratic choices into the world and the future.<a id="post-9483-_Ref182911621"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-305" href="#post-9483-footnote-305">[304]</a></sup> The agency practices our research reveals highlight that government is for governing: Workability itself represents a core constitutional value.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-306" href="#post-9483-footnote-306">[305]</a></sup> Our research ultimately shows how agencies’ work with statutes can reinforce democratic responsiveness, providing an important, likely unique, site for pluralistic contestation over the specific policy choices the federal government must make for statutes to have concrete meaning.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-307" href="#post-9483-footnote-307">[306]</a></sup> Prioritizing juricentric forms of interpretation, particularly those that would circumscribe delegation, will also often mean depriving democratically enacted statutes of their efficacy.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-308" href="#post-9483-footnote-308">[307]</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea that agencies co-create statutory meaning through practical implementation may raise concerns that agencies will distend statutes, manipulating them to achieve idiosyncratic policy objectives not contemplated or desired by elected officials.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-309" href="#post-9483-footnote-309">[308]</a></sup> And indeed, we do not mean to suggest that agencies always produce desirable or even workable programs, nor that agency policymaking through existing statutory frameworks will always be preferable to fresh congressional action. Sometimes agency action will be insufficient to address new problems precisely because old laws addressed to old problems do not provide the requisite legal authority, or because old statutory regimes are simply too disconnected from an emergent reality to function well.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-310" href="#post-9483-footnote-310">[309]</a></sup> Agency decisions can also be inefficient, misguided, distorted by ideological objectives, and as neglectful of society’s disadvantaged as the U.S. Code itself.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158280640"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-311" href="#post-9483-footnote-311">[310]</a></sup> Even the best procedures cannot eliminate the risk that agencies will bend statutes to the will of aggrandizing officials.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-312" href="#post-9483-footnote-312">[311]</a></sup></p>
<p>But given the relative institutional capacities we have emphasized, we think our best hope for minimizing the risks associated with agency action lies in strengthening the kinds of responsive practices we have described. We should facilitate broader participation at earlier stages of the policymaking process and ensure that agencies are both empowered and required to consider important normative values beyond economic costs.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-313" href="#post-9483-footnote-313">[312]</a></sup> Insisting that Congress legislate with alacrity to meet every moment that demands a response, in contrast, undercuts workable, accountable governance.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-314" href="#post-9483-footnote-314">[313]</a></sup></p>
<p>As we intimated in subpart III(A), some might prefer to assign the historical and sociological mediation of policy preferences to courts.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-315" href="#post-9483-footnote-315">[314]</a></sup> While we think courts can and should play a part in keeping statutes relevant to evolving circumstances (in ways we describe in more detail in subpart III(C)), our research suggests that the judiciary will have less capacity and competence to perform this role than agencies.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-316" href="#post-9483-footnote-316">[315]</a></sup> This observation, in turn, suggests that courts should regard agencies at least as equals, if not leaders, in the interpretation of statutes—agencies <em>do </em>have special competence in interpreting statutes. For one thing, courts confront statutes sporadically, and only at the behest of litigants seeking specific relief. Agencies, by contrast, must maintain the statutory regime continuously, independently of the demands of aggrieved parties. Courts, limited by standing doctrines, can neither solicit nor process broad input on the myriad factors that relate to the purposes or efficacy of a statutory regime; they lack institutional mechanisms for taking into account the range of interests and views a given statute implicates. Agencies, in contrast, solicit such input both as a legal requirement for rulemaking and as a discretionary practice.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-317" href="#post-9483-footnote-317">[316]</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps most important, courts are staffed by legal generalists. They lack the capacity to fully assess the implications of real-world changes, evaluate options within the broader policy landscape, or assess how a given decision will affect other regulatory policies.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158284178"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-318" href="#post-9483-footnote-318">[317]</a></sup> In contrast, as our research shows, these kinds of assessments form a large part of the work of agencies, which are staffed by many people with diverse expertise who must work together to produce policy plans.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158282173"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-319" href="#post-9483-footnote-319">[318]</a></sup> Unlike agencies, moreover, courts do not participate in making legislation; most judges lack an understanding of the concerns that animate any given statute or statutory drafting in general.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158284233"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-320" href="#post-9483-footnote-320">[319]</a></sup> Agencies are in conversation with members of Congress, regulated parties, and affected publics.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-321" href="#post-9483-footnote-321">[320]</a></sup> Courts, in other words, cannot match agencies’ capacity for reconciling directives from the past with the pluralistic demands of the present.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158290560"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-322" href="#post-9483-footnote-322">[321]</a></sup> Unlike courts, agencies do not have the luxury of merely interpreting some statutory term a litigant has placed at issue. Agencies must develop plans to effectuate the whole statute. And they must adapt those paths over time as the world to which the statute applies changes. Agencies’ work with statutes is thus more complex—both conceptually and in terms of the number of people and views involved—than courts’.</p>
<h3><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712163"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737893"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339789"></a> C. Doctrine</h3>
<p>Contemporary Supreme Court jurisprudence is in stark tension with the conception of agencies’ role that we have just offered, increasingly placing courts at the statutory helm. Take <em>Chevron </em>deference. Even before the Court overruled <em>Chevron </em>during its 2023 Term, the Court had mostly abandoned the doctrinal regime that instructs courts to accept reasonable agency understandings of open-ended statutory terms.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158290928"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-323" href="#post-9483-footnote-323">[322]</a></sup> Courts that have either ignored or eschewed <em>Chevron</em> deference often have painted themselves as returning power usurped by the agency back to Congress.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-324" href="#post-9483-footnote-324">[323]</a></sup> In fact, though, such moves undermine Congress, negating its ability to decide who should effectuate its statutes.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-325" href="#post-9483-footnote-325">[324]</a></sup> Courts operating in this vein effectively claim for themselves the power to decide how regulatory statutes should be effectuated—decisions that, as we have noted, they have comparatively less capacity than agencies to make. These most recent decisions only promise to heighten the agency risk aversion we bring to light in Part II, which almost certainly will slow policymaking down. This very result may be precisely what <em>Chevron</em>’s foes have in mind, but it simply underscores how recent doctrinal developments increasingly put the judiciary in charge of how—and whether—statutes can have concrete meaning in the world.</p>
<p>The Court’s “major questions doctrine,” which it has broadened considerably in recent years, exacerbates this situation by imposing unrealistic, unpredictable, and ahistorical conditions on Congress’s choices as embodied in legislation.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158561956"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-326" href="#post-9483-footnote-326">[325]</a></sup> This doctrine, too, purports to serve Congress while instead aggrandizing power to courts, which now get to determine which agency actions will be allowed to go into effect absent a specific statutory authorization, with courts determining ad hoc how much specificity is needed—even where a broadly worded delegation comfortably encompasses the agency action in question.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-327" href="#post-9483-footnote-327">[326]</a></sup> A growing literature rightly criticizes this new doctrine from a number of perspectives.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158577149"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-328" href="#post-9483-footnote-328">[327]</a></sup> Justice Kagan noted the irony well: “[T]he Court substitutes its own ideas about delegations for Congress’s. And that means the Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking for Congress’s. The Court will not allow the [statute] to work as Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress, will decide how much regulation is too much.”<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-329" href="#post-9483-footnote-329">[328]</a></sup> Our research highlights how the doctrine undermines agencies’ pluralistic decisionmaking, undertaken with the people it will affect in mind. It also depletes Congress’s power to project its commands into the future.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-330" href="#post-9483-footnote-330">[329]</a></sup> The major questions doctrine puts courts in charge of deciding how, if at all, multivalent statutes should apply to novel regulatory challenges and changed circumstances.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-331" href="#post-9483-footnote-331">[330]</a></sup> The Court thus enervates agencies’ ability to perform a function necessary in a democracy—integrating the political will of past generations with the needs of the day.</p>
<p>The systemic understanding of statutory implementation we offer, and the concomitant critique of existing doctrine, do not mean that courts have no meaningful role to play in overseeing the administrative state. On the contrary, courts ought to recognize the key functions agencies serve in our democracy and push agencies to play their role well. We have shown, for instance, that agencies have the capacity to engage in regular pluralistic contestation about specific policy choices over time. Courts should acknowledge that competence and encourage agencies to use it. The drive to eliminate <em>Chevron</em> rests on the contention that courts are best positioned to identify a statute’s true, or best, meaning.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-332" href="#post-9483-footnote-332">[331]</a></sup> But as our discussion here indicates, regulatory statutes often <em>have</em> no objectively best meaning; judges who find one without accounting for differentiated effects, competing interests, and workability considerations will often merely substitute their personal ideas for an agency’s more informed, pluralistic process—one that also has the benefit of congressional authorization.<a id="post-9483-_Ref158284264"></a><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-333" href="#post-9483-footnote-333">[332]</a></sup></p>
<p>The current Court has made clear its disdain for deference doctrines and embraced a conception of statutes as law with fixed meanings that courts must discern by their own lights. We offer an alternative approach to judicial review for the future—one that entails a more radical appreciation of agency work than even <em>Chevron </em>itself. When confronted with an agency interpretation of a statute, a court should ask whether the statutory regime supports the agency’s view of what the statute authorizes. In other words, we would not return to the so-called step 1 of <em>Chevron </em>and the idea that courts should attempt to use all of the tools of statutory construction to determine whether a statute is ambiguous. The pervasively open-ended nature of statutes means that, in many cases, such analysis is little more than an opportunity for judges to incorporate their own intuitions into their supposedly legalistic practice. And the varied means by which agencies implement statutes underscore that determining a statute’s meaning removed from context belies the very thing statutes are for—to provide frameworks for <em>policy </em>or <em>action</em>.</p>
<p>This picture could, in theory, emerge from a regime that applies <em>Skidmore</em><sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-334" href="#post-9483-footnote-334">[333]</a></sup> deference and therefore in the aftermath of <em>Loper-Bright</em>. Courts could begin with the agency’s account of what its statute authorizes and remain open to understanding the statute in light of what the statutory custodian has come up with. The demise of <em>Chevron </em>does not require otherwise. Such an approach respects Congress’s decision to instruct agencies to “build the thing” its statutes call for, and acknowledges that regulatory decisions are largely provisional, allowing and even requiring changes as circumstances develop.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-335" href="#post-9483-footnote-335">[334]</a></sup> A court’s role would be to ensure that agencies exercise their duties of loyalty and care, establishing a sound legal basis for taking action. In this vein, in place of the major questions doctrine, we might embrace a cabined elephants-in-mouseholes canon, in which courts ensure that agencies do not promulgate unexpected policies that exceed the scope of statutory authorization.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-336" href="#post-9483-footnote-336">[335]</a></sup> Instead of unrealistically claiming that agencies need specific direction from Congress to address whatever a court deems important, this inquiry would recognize that Congress delegates broadly and relies on agencies for intertemporal policy cohesion, in part because lawmakers cannot predict the future.</p>
<p>Our research also speaks to how courts might conduct arbitrariness review. Given how agencies work with statutes, they should not have to consider all conceivable policy options, nor eliminate all uncertainty about a policy’s likely effects.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-337" href="#post-9483-footnote-337">[336]</a></sup> Policymaking is inevitably, and appropriately, informed by value judgments, which can provide adequate foundation for agency policy, including policy changes within an unchanged statutory regime. Judicial review should not seek to ferret out or eradicate such normative orientations, or require an agency to be so comprehensive in its policy work that it becomes sluggish at best, but should focus instead on whether a policy lacks a reasonable foundation or appears to result from untested whims.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-338" href="#post-9483-footnote-338">[337]</a></sup></p>
<p>We do not expect the current Court to suddenly reverse course based on our evidence-based critique of its dominant assumptions about the administrative state, any more than it has in response to arguments based in doctrine, interpretive theory, formalist concerns, and so on.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-339" href="#post-9483-footnote-339">[338]</a></sup> Still, the Court, like any government institution, will change over time; future members may be more receptive to doctrines grounded in a reality-based approach that tolerates and even appreciates law’s indeterminacy. The lower courts, confronted with new challenges to agency policymaking based on open-ended statutory language, may begin to develop the sort of deference regime we describe above. Moreover, by showing how the Court’s doctrinal disruptions undermine the very democratic accountability it claims to promote, we hope to inform how scholars and other interested observers credit the Court’s pronouncements and seek to ameliorate their antidemocratic effects.</p>
<p>Even more important, Supreme Court Justices are not the only people who get a say in how government runs; democracy is fundamentally characterized by dispute about both the distribution and the content of power.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-340" href="#post-9483-footnote-340">[339]</a></sup> We aim here to illuminate the everyday practices of agencies working with statutes, to inform all manner of officials, groups, and citizens operating in a policymaking world with a view to channeling popular will into concrete action. We believe that the pluralistic practices we uncover help make governance democratic, as well as effective. That should provide <em>political</em> support for the administrative state at a time when its greatest threat comes not from courts but from interest groups, lawmakers, and political officials who seek to dismantle the state and its capacity to govern.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-341" href="#post-9483-footnote-341">[340]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="post-9483-_Toc158712164"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc170737894"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339790"></a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The empirical realities our study reveals can help ground normative evaluations of administration. Our research supports the contention that agency action is ineluctably political: permeated not just with subject-matter and legal expertise but also with considerations of competing values, diverse interests, and public palatability. With one single exception, none of our interviewees claimed that working with statutes was simple or followed standardized rules. None claimed—or even claimed to strive for—the kind of neutrality sometimes attributed to idealized administration. In our view, this open acceptance of normative, political considerations is a strength, as is agencies’ concern about consequences. The implementation of statutes involves choices that inevitably distribute public goods and constraints unevenly; there is no neutral outcome. Claims to neutrality only obfuscate the value judgments and political considerations that inevitably attend statutory effectuation. The agency practices we present here do not eliminate the possibility of inequitable, unjust, or unwise outcomes.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-342" href="#post-9483-footnote-342">[341]</a></sup> But they provide opportunities for ameliorating them. Our work shows that the way forward requires strengthening, not limiting, the tools agencies have to create policies that benefit the public interest.</p>

<p>Our aim with this project was not to interview a representative sample of government employees, nor to gather answers that could easily be tabulated and compared, but to conduct in-depth interviews that could reveal realities not easily captured by larger-scale methods. We conducted thirty-nine open-ended, semi-structured interviews with current and former agency employees, both political appointees and career civil servants, between July 2016 and May 2018. Our subjects came from eleven agencies: executive agencies, independent agencies, and the Executive Office of the President. Some focused on benefits management, others on industry regulation, and a couple on the governance of the government itself. A majority of our interviewees were no longer serving in the government.</p>
<p>The majority of the political appointees we interviewed served during the Obama Administration; several of those had also served during the Clinton Administration. Several served during the George W. Bush Administration, and one in the Trump Administration. The significant representation by Obama-era officials was primarily due to the ease of enrolling subjects, but also to the recency of their experience, which made their accounts fresher and more specific.</p>
<p>The career civil servants we interviewed spanned presidential administrations from George H.W. Bush to Trump. The bulk of their experience was during the George W. Bush and Obama years. Figure 1 lists the agencies where our subjects had worked over the course of their careers. Some subjects served in more than one administration, and some had moved between career and political roles over their careers.</p>

<p>To recruit subjects, we primarily relied on a “snowball” approach, in which we contacted acquaintances in our personal and professional networks who worked in agencies, requested interviews, and asked for recommendations of or introductions to others who might be interested in participating in the study. In a broader solicitation approach, two of our contacts who had worked in the Obama Administration published our project solicitation email on listservs for former colleagues. We later learned that this email was republished on at least one other listserv. (This is one reason Obama-era subjects are highly represented in our interviews.)</p>
<p>In addition, having drawn several participants from one specific agency through personal contacts and snowball methods, we sent personal solicitations to a number of other colleagues in that agency and followed up with phone calls. (We identified possible participants by looking at agency websites and <em>Federal Register</em> publications, as well as through the interviews we had already conducted.) Although a number of people initially responded to this solicitation, most canceled before we could conduct the interviews after a department-wide email from a high-level official prohibited employees from participating in our study.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-346" href="#post-9483-footnote-346">[345]</a></sup> After this, we relied only on the first two, informal, methods to solicit subjects. Every person who agreed to participate was interviewed.</p>
<p>Our recruitment email read as follows:</p>
<p>We’d like to invite you to participate in a research project on statutory interpretation and policymaking in federal agencies. We are two law professors ([redacted]) who specialize in administrative law and statutory interpretation. For this project, we are conducting confidential interviews with current and former agency personnel. We would be grateful for the chance to interview you about your work.</p>
<p>Our interviews explore how agency employees interpret unclear statutory terms, and how they formulate policies in the face of multiple pressures and constraints. The point is not to expose deficiencies in the regulatory process, but to educate scholars, judges, and the public about how our government actually works. It has never been more important to understand and explain the complex and vital work that agencies do. We hope illuminating the agency’s perspective will make an important contribution to the national conversation about regulation.</p>
<p>We are conducting interviews by phone, and can arrange to talk at a time convenient to you. Both the [redacted] Internal Review Boards have approved the project. (The attached “informed consent” document tells you more about the research and our strict confidentiality measures.) We plan to use material from these interviews in articles for publication in law reviews.</p>
<p>If you would be interested in participating, please contact us. We’d also be happy to talk about the project further. Thanks for considering it, and we hope to talk to you soon.</p>

<p>The informed-consent document referenced in the recruitment email, which we sent to every prospective participant, included both an Institutional Review Board-mandated disclosure and a brief introduction to the study. It read as follows:</p>
<h3><strong>Research Study: Agency Statutory Interpretation and Policymaking</strong></h3>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in the Agency Statutory Interpretation and Policymaking Study run by [redacted]. For this study, we are conducting confidential interviews about rulemaking practices with current and former federal agency personnel. In particular, we hope to explore how agency employees interpret unclear terms in the statutes they implement, and how they formulate policies in the face of multiple pressures and constraints. We hope that our results will add to knowledge about how government functions and how statutes are implemented over time. We also anticipate that this research will illuminate how administrators’ statutory interpretation practices differ from judges’. We believe the lack of attention to this topic has been detrimental both to legal scholarship and to public discourse, and we hope to make a contribution to both.</p>
<p>The human subjects research review boards at [redacted] have approved this study. All of your responses will be held in the strictest confidence. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight at [redacted] will know your identity or have access to the information you provide. We plan to audio tape the interview. If you prefer not to be recorded, please advise us and we will note your responses by hand instead. Notes or transcripts of your interview will be numbered, and the code linking your number with your name will be stored in a separate file from the transcript, on a secure server and password protected computer. After publication of the study, transcripts will be stored on a secure server without any identifying information connected to them. In addition to avoiding any direct links between your identity and what you tell us, we will do our utmost to ensure that nothing we publish based on this study can be traced back to you individually.</p>
<p>Participation in this study will involve an interview, by phone or in person, of approximately one hour. There is no compensation for participation. There are no known or anticipated risks to you for participating. Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual questions. Your decision whether to participate in this study will not affect your relationship with [redacted].</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with someone other than the researchers to discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the event that a member of the research team is not available, or to discuss your rights as a research participant, you may contact the [redacted].</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with the researchers, please feel free to contact us.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-347" href="#post-9483-footnote-347">[346]</a></sup></p>
<h3><strong>Brief Study Synopsis</strong></h3>
<p>Modern government depends in large part on how agencies interpret statutory provisions and make policy, but legal scholarship generally focuses instead on judges and legislators. This study will be among the first to illuminate how agency personnel interpret statutory provisions. We hope to highlight the creativity and difficulty of making a statutory scheme work on the ground. We intend to interview a range of agency administrators about the tools, assumptions, approaches, methods, and reflections that guide administrators’ interpretation and implementation of statutes. We hope to give the administrator’s point of view a voice that is missing from scholarship and doctrine.</p>
<p>We will ask administrators to discuss, in their own words, what they do when confronted with a complex or ambiguous statute, how they formulate policy based on the statute, and what their work means to them. We will also ask how agencies structure the interpretive and policymaking process: What sorts of officials make which decisions during the different phases of developing a guidance or a rule?</p>
<p>We do not aim to expose inadequacies in agency practices, nor do we have a predetermined view about how agencies ought to do their work. On the contrary, we feel that the important work administrators do to bring statutes to life has been obscured by the scholarly focus on courts. We aim to inject a pragmatic, real-world understanding of agency practices into both scholarship and doctrine, to complement and perhaps change the theories on which courts rely when evaluating agency action.</p>

<p>A few interviews took place in person, but most were conducted over Zoom (usually using audio only). We conducted almost all interviews together, usually each asking about half of the questions. Sometimes, with participants’ permission, we had research assistants listening on the line as well. Most interviews lasted between one and two hours, though several lasted longer or even spanned two separate calls, at the interviewee’s request. Almost all interviewees agreed to record the interviews; for the few that declined, we took notes by hand. Recorded interviews were professionally transcribed.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-348" href="#post-9483-footnote-348">[347]</a></sup></p>
<p>To develop an interview guide to structure the conversations, we considered our own primary interests and reviewed scholarly literature to assess where we could add to existing knowledge. We also consulted with colleagues in academia and contacts with experience in the federal administration to ensure our questions were relevant and comprehensible. Because we were not aiming for a statistical comparison of participant answers, we did not treat the guide as a survey instrument. Rather, it provided a reminder of the topics we wanted to cover, while still encouraging participants to focus on the matters of greatest concern or interest to them. This guide did not exhaust the questions asked. We generally asked follow-up questions in each section to explore the interviewee’s responses and experiences further.</p>
<p>Our interview protocol started with open-ended questions about the interviewee’s main roles or projects in government and the normal process of producing policy (through rules or guidance) in their agency. We then asked about the role of Congress (including congressional intent, legislative history, and consultation with Congress); other sources or methods for statutory interpretation; and the roles of other agencies, the White House, states, and the public. We also asked about the role of courts (including prospective consideration of litigation risk, litigation practices and outcomes, judicial doctrines like <em>Chevron</em>, and interpretive theories like textualism and purposivism). We invited interviewees to explain in their own terms how they thought about statutory interpretation and implementation. We also asked whether our questions elicited what they thought was relevant about the work they did and whether there were other questions we should ask.</p>

<p>Our aim was to encourage our subjects to discuss their particular experiences and views without confining them to a set of predetermined options or answers. We adjusted the interview protocol somewhat for each interview, pursuing the leads interviewees offered and spending more or less time on particular topics depending on what interviewees regarded as important in their work. Where possible, we also tailored interviews to interviewees’ particular backgrounds and the projects they had worked on (which we asked about when setting up interviews). This helped us ground our questions in specific interviewee experiences, which are often easier to talk about and more revealing of actual practices than abstract or conceptual discussions. Our interview protocol also developed over time as subjects suggested relevant questions or pointed us to more productive ways of pursuing an inquiry.</p>
<p>Framing questions in terms of an interviewee’s specific background grounds the conversation in their personal experiences and creates a specific joint object of focus for interviewees and interviewers. It allows interviewees to focus on a particular experience they have gone through and describe it, then examine whether they feel it was unusual in the context of their broader experience. That takes pressure off the interviewee to provide a neat or universal description of a process that may be complex or variable, and it helps us get at the particularities of participants’ experiences of working in the agency. It also lays the ground for follow-up questions that are easier to formulate and to answer, since we can ask about the particular experiences the interviewee has already described.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-349" href="#post-9483-footnote-349">[348]</a></sup> Often, we would come back to particular situations an interviewee had discussed as we went through the interview, using interviewees’ descriptions as an anchor for further conversation.<a id="post-9483-_Toc96074303"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc96944854"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc96946035"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc96946057"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc96946087"></a><a id="post-9483-_Toc141863749"></a></p>
<h4><a id="post-9483-_Toc194339795"></a><em> D. Synthesizing the Data</em></h4>
<p>Using both our interview protocol and our emerging sense of subject responses from both interviews and transcripts, we, along with our research assistants, developed a code book for coding responses.<sup><a id="post-9483-footnote-ref-350" href="#post-9483-footnote-350">[349]</a></sup> We had several aims in constructing the code book: to capture the key issues we asked about; to reflect the key themes emerging in interviewees’ responses; and to be easily usable. Together with our research assistants, we developed codes, tested them on a few transcripts, and further refined them in subsequent discussions. The following table presents the coding categories in our code book, along with the shorthand explanations that we developed for all coders to use.</p>

<p>Along with two research assistants per interview transcript, we each independently coded each transcript, then talked through discrepancies to come to a consensus on appropriate categories, creating a master-coded transcript for each interview. Research assistants then collated the coded text into spreadsheets showing all the text for each coding label. Each entry indicates the speaker (by pseudonym) and shows what other coding labels we applied to the same text passage (since a single text passage often fit several coding labels). Each text entry has a unique number; this Article cites interview quotations by reference to this number. The coding process also gave us an ambient sense of the material and helped us identify the topic areas where our diverse respondents’ discussions converged to reveal underappreciated aspects of agencies’ work with statutes. Of course, no single methodology or study could reveal all that is important about administration. We hope our research spurs more empirical work, using diverse methodologies, to illuminate the complex operations of our government.</p>

That makes sense if we assume that the relevant styles of interpretation are sufficiently captured by the terms set by judges who express adherence to the competing prescriptive tenets of purposivism and textualism. Our work, in contrast, suggests that neither textualism nor purposivism suffices to describe what agencies actually do. <a href="#post-9483-footnote-ref-12">↑</a></li>

<li id="post-9483-footnote-25">. Broadly speaking, we take textualism as some combination of “a commitment to rely on a limited universe of text-based interpretive tools such as plain meaning, dictionary definitions, the whole act and whole code rules, and language canons—and to avoid consulting purposive tools such as legislative history, statutory purpose, legislative intent, and practical consequences”; “a commitment to identify a statute’s ‘original public meaning’ as of the date the statute was enacted”; and a “commitment . . . to identify the ordinary meaning that a statute would have to average citizens or laypersons.” Anita S.

<li id="post-9483-footnote-26">. Broadly speaking, we take purposivism to hold that “how Congress makes its purposes known, through text and reliable accompanying materials constituting legislative history, should be respected, lest the integrity of legislation be undermined.” <small>Robert A.

<li id="post-9483-footnote-28">. Agency mission thus comes closer to a “nautical” approach that views statutory meaning as “an on-going process (a voyage) in which both the” enacting Congress and other participants “play a role.” <em>Id. </em>at 21<em>.</em> Purposivist tenets tend to operate with some specificity: they are used when considering particular statutory terms. <em>See </em>John F. Manning, <em>The New Purposivism</em>, 2011 <small>Sup. Ct. Rev.</small> 113, 116–19 (2012) (highlighting converging justifications and applications of purposivism and textualism). The general kinds of orienting mission concepts we heard—keeping the air clean, helping small businesses get contracts, maintaining the public healthcare budget—rarely appear in purposivist analysis.

<li id="post-9483-footnote-30">. The relationship between laws made in the past and people governed by them in the present is an enduringly complex aspect of democratic governance. On the one hand, one can sense that “[w]e are indebted to those who came before us, for it is through their efforts that the world of culture we inhabit now exists,” giving social participants “a duty to respect and to conserve the achievements of their predecessors.” Anthony T. Kronman, <em>Precedent and Tradition</em>, 99 <small>Yale L.J</small>. <small>1029, 1057,</small> 1067 (1990). On the other, one can declare independence: “by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independant nation to another.” Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (Sept. 6, 1789), <em>in</em> 15 <small>The Papers of Thomas Jefferson</small> 392, 395 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1958). Intermediating institutions can help find balance between the two: “the judge in shaping the rules of law must heed the <em>mores</em> of his day.” <small>Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process </small>103–05 (1921). Even more so, we argue, can the agency, which is particularly suited to addressing “polycentric” problems. <em>See </em>Lon L. Fuller, <em>The Forms and Limits of Adjudication</em>, 92 <small>Harv. L. Rev.</small> 353, 394–95, 398 (1978) (explaining the concept of polycentric tasks, which are best resolved by “managerial direction”). <a href="#post-9483-footnote-ref-30">↑</a></li>

<li id="post-9483-footnote-330">. As we have noted, courts lack agencies’ capacity for convening a broad array of participants to inform policy decisions; they similarly lack a historically evolving sense of statutory mission. Their decisions about the application of regulatory statutes are thus likely less informed, less pluralistic, and less politically accountable than those of agencies. <em>See </em>Rodríguez, <em>supra </em>note 243, at 58–91 (defending many elements of presidential administration as not only legitimate, but oftentimes democratically necessary); Bernstein &amp; Rodríguez, <em>supra </em>note 15, at 1678 (arguing that courts’ interpretations should be shaped by “a realistic understanding” of “agencies’ robust accountability practices”). <a href="#post-9483-footnote-ref-330">↑</a></li>
<li id="post-9483-footnote-331">. By preventing statutory effects from adapting to changing circumstance, the doctrine renders its target statutes effectively obsolete. This obsolescence, moreover, is sporadic: courts employ the major questions doctrine only at the instance of litigants, and only in cases they choose to construe as sufficiently major. Courts thus get to decide which statutes should not be effectuated. <a href="#post-9483-footnote-ref-331">↑</a></li>

<li id="post-9483-footnote-344">. Although of course any interview study depends on the people who agree to be interviewed, we sought to mitigate the danger of self-serving descriptions by keeping our questions largely practice-oriented, rather than value-oriented, clearly marking off areas where we sought the interviewee’s personal opinion. Our discussion in this Article rests on general trends we saw prevalent in the answers of different people in different positions. Of course, participants could still give self-serving accounts in many ways, and we assume that our subjects, like many people, might often like to portray themselves in a favorable light. This does not, we think, diminish the reliability of the mutually reinforcing descriptions subjects gave of the practices they engaged in, nor does it undermine the information they provided about their own insider views on their workplace. <a href="#post-9483-footnote-ref-344">↑</a></li>
