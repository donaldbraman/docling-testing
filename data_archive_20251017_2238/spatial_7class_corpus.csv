"While  conceding  legislatures'  ability  to  regulate,  the  Court  soon  began seeking an actuarial method that would allow courts to determine utility rates. 140 By the late 1890s, in Smyth v. Ames ,  the Court established a 'fair value' test, which  held  that  'the  basis  of  all  calculations  as  to  the  reasonableness  of rates . . . must be the fair value of the property being used [by a railroad] for the convenience of the public.' 141 The Court treated ratemaking as a precise science. Agencies had to consider 'the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the  present  as  compared  with  the  original  cost  of  construction,  the  probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses.' 142 Cases such as Smyth v. Ames and Chicago, Milwaukee & Saint Paul Railway held that investors still had a private property interest in their utility investment. 143",body_text,226,288,779,497,553,209,30,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

Or, to make a developer internalize the cost of infrastructure improvements, a local government might require her to own land sufficient to encompass the minimum efficient scale for a new arterial road. The reason for actually requiring ownership in the latter case rather than simply imposing an impact fee might be uncertainty about the extent, type, and cost of infrastructure that would be required, which might depend in some measure on aspects of the developer's project that are difficult to specify in advance.",footnote,146,744,837,855,691,111,58,columbia_forcings

"To some, Amazon's singular impact on the trademark system will suggest that the platform is simply too powerful, whatever one thinks of the antitrust issues. At the very least, the effects we have described here should force us to reflect on whether we are comfortable with a single company setting internal rules for its own benefit when the effect is to reconfigure a legal system that was not developed with such a powerful actor in mind. Amazon is leveraging the existing  trademark  system,  outsourcing  decisions  about  trademark  validity  to resolve conflicts on its platform and protect its business model. Importantly, it is seeking to ward off prospective regulation that would expose the company to products  liability  claims  and  liability  for  counterfeits  sold  on  its  platform. 378 Amazon's leveraging of the trademark system is not incidental to that goal. By piggybacking on the U.S. trademark system rather than building an independent brand verification system from scratch, Amazon is able to claim the high ground of the government's own gold-standard system, making government regulation",body_text,226,437,779,662,553,225,65,california_law_review_Amazons_Quiet_Overhaul_of_the_Trademark_System

"The second trademark-related advantage for Amazon in selling under its own brands, particularly AMAZON BASICS or AMAZON ESSENTIALS, is that  Amazon  is  a  beloved,  trusted,  and  widely  recognized  brand. 306 Indeed, communications scholar West emphasizes that 'Amazon has normalized its own ubiquity[, which] should be viewed as an accomplishment borne of branding, public  relations,  and  relationship  marketing.' 307 Consumers  who  shop  on Amazon are very likely to be drawn to Amazon-branded products. In that vein, West observes that 'Amazon has . . . leveraged the trust that consumers have in its  brand  to  launch  sub-brands'  like  AMAZON  BASICS  and  AMAZON ESSENTIALS. 308 Furthermore, Amazon's de-centering of third-party branding, which is the same de-centering that leads many businesses to opt for nonsense marks, 309 likely  amplifies  Amazon's  own  branding  strategies.  The  fact  that Amazon  is  consolidating  its  house  brands  under  the  AMAZON  BASICS, AMAZON ESSENTIALS, and related house brands containing the AMAZON mark, while discarding unrelated house marks, suggests that Amazon recognizes the power of its AMAZON-centered marks.",body_text,226,140,779,397,553,257,55,california_law_review_Amazons_Quiet_Overhaul_of_the_Trademark_System

"Sandra  Muñoz, a  U.S. citizen  by birth,  a  workers'  rights  lawyer,  and  a resident  of  Los  Angeles, 11 filed  a  lawsuit  when  her  husband,  Luis  AsencioCordero,  was  denied  entry  into  the  United  States  after  he  traveled  to  El Salvador. 12  Prior to his trip to El Salvador, Asencio-Cordero had been residing in the United States without documentation. 13  Several years after his marriage to Muñoz made him eligible for a family-based immigrant visa, he applied for his visa. Because the law required him to travel to El Salvador to process his visa, 14 Asencio-Cordero  also  applied  for  and received  from  the  Department  of Homeland Security a waiver of the unlawful presence bar that would otherwise have prevented him from returning to the United States for ten years. 15  Armed with  that  waiver,  he  left  the  United  States  to  complete  his  visa  application process in El Salvador. 16   Unfortunately,  when  he then  sought to  return to  the United States, the State Department's consular officials working in the embassy in  El  Salvador  denied  his  visa application. 17 In  justifying  the  visa  denial, the government  offered  no  formal  explanation  beyond  a  citation  to  a  statutory provision: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(A)(ii).

"3. Compensation. -If just compensation were required for a forcing, what would it look like? A likely starting point is fair market value, the constitutional touchstone for eminent domain. 301 In the case of condemnation, the government exercises a call option; it pays out money and receives property. In a forcing, by contrast, property moves from the government to the private landowner-a governmental exercise of a put option. The amount of money that changes hands, and the direction in which the money flows, depends on the strike price for that put option. If the property's fair market value is positive, this would seem to call for the government to collect money, not pay it out-although an offset of some sort might remain appropriate in light of the forced nature of the transfer. It is also entirely possible for property to carry a negative fair market value, depending on the obligations that go with the ownership",body_text,160,578,851,795,691,217,71,columbia_forcings

"We  describe  four  alternative  approaches  to  resolving  interdepartmental disputes. 4 First,  some  members  of  the  founding  generation  embraced  an Antidomination  theory  about  legislative  and  executive  powers. 5 This  theory denied that the terms 'executive' or 'legislative' implied justiciable limits on government authority, at least beyond certain specifically enumerated powers. It instead  stipulated  processes  by  which  the  legislative  and  executive  branches could  enact  legally  binding  policies:  Legislation  must  be  enacted  through bicameralism and presentment, and the President must act via express statutory or constitutional authorization. The constitutionally relevant fact was that each branch  respected  the  Constitution's  procedural  constraints.  To  be  sure,  other structural theories travelled alongside this view, but for some early interpreters of  the  Constitution,  the  drafters'  political  theory  focused  on  the  document's procedural  checks  as  the  'practical'  elaboration  of  the  core  idea,  not  on metaphysical appeals to the concept of 'executive,' 'legislative,' or 'judicial.' 6",body_text,226,207,779,431,553,224,4,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

Scholars  began  to  push  beyond  liberalism's  basic proposition that the state should minimally interfere in conceptions of the good life and instead doubted the ability of our legal culture to agree on principles of basic justice. 159 This shift was most emblematic in Sunstein's work. In the late 1980s, Sunstein argued for the Rawlsian-influenced civic republican revival. 160 However, by 1995 he began arguing that judges should make decisions based on 'incompletely  theorized  agreements'  given  that  judges  likely  disagree  on matters of basic justice and other abstract normative theories. 161",body_text,226,437,779,580,553,143,31,california_law_review_Social_Justice_Conflicts_in_Public_Law

But the removal issue has not always been framed as being  about  the  President's  relationship  to  Congress.  During  the  nineteenth century, arguments about the President's authority to fire members of the civil service were often based on policymakers' views about political science, 3 by",body_text,226,556,779,715,553,159,3,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

Proregulatory justices and progressive reformers treated it as capacious. For them, it  was  a  legislative  prerogative  to  define  which  firms  were  so  affected.  Antiregulatory justices, by contrast, often treated the first two categories as a closed set and rejected the third category altogether. 87 Both sets of advocates attributed their views to Munn . 88 At times, courts sought a middle ground between these two positions and reviewed legislative determinations to make sure a firm's size, monopoly or common carrier status, or some other pragmatic judgment justified government control. 89",body_text,226,140,779,331,553,191,21,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers
"The fact that it is normatively appropriate to impose a burden on a particular party does not establish, on its own, that the burden should take the form of an unwanted ownership interest. Externalities can often be addressed through systems of payments and collections. Mundane examples include the imposition of taxes, fees, and damages of various sorts when a party's actions cause impacts that her own property ownership interests do not automatically charge against her account. While collections are likely to be both aversive to the owner and coercively imposed by the government, they do not force the transfer of possessory ownership. Collections that accompany the consensual transfer of possessory property interests can also be distinguished from forcings. Thus, it is not a forcing when a voluntary purchase transaction is followed by a coercive action to collect payment for it, assuming the amount collected represents the agreed-upon purchase price.",body_text,160,632,851,866,691,234,43,columbia_forcings

"Adding Justice Arabian's process-based analysis supports this conclusion. The statewide RHNA process is plainly incompatible with the exercise of local direct democracy powers. From the outset, the entire RHNA process takes two years to complete: HCD tells the COGs how much housing they need to plan for two years before the housing elements are due, and the COGs are required to tell local  governments their respective allocations no later than a year before the housing elements are due. 139 This allows at most a year for an initiative to pass and  even  less  for  a  referendum  to  reject  a  proposed  housing  element.  The initiative process takes significant time: an unspecified amount of time to prepare the petition, 15 days after submission to receive a title and summary from the city attorney, 140 no more than 180 days to collect signatures, 141 and an additional 30 days (excluding weekends and holidays) for the local elections official to certify that the petition had sufficient signatures. 142 In sum, that is 225 days just to get a viable petition. From there, the city council has 10 days to adopt the petition, order a report (which could add 30 more days), or submit the petition to a vote. 143 That is a maximum of 265 days after the petition was submitted before voters even get a look at the initiative. 144 It is hard to reconcile the time required to submit a petition to vote with the year-long deadline the State has imposed upon local governments to adopt a housing element. 145",body_text,226,288,779,595,553,307,16,california_law_review_Revisiting_City_of_Morgan_Hill_Fixing_Californias_Direct_Democracy_Preemption_Test

"management. The conservation movement rose to prominence by stressing the protection  of  ecological  collectives-that  is,  species  and  ecosystems.  This commitment  powerfully  influenced  federal  statutes  passed  between  the  early twentieth century and the 1970s. The animal advocacy movement, on the other hand, came to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s and strove to protect animals for their own sake, regardless of their conservation value. This movement, and the ethical frameworks it spawned, gained momentum only after the passage of flagship wildlife management laws. Yet, Congress apparently shared some of the intuitions that motivated animal advocates. The seeds of concern for individual animals' inherent value appear in the same statutes that enshrine conservationist principles.

Currently, the mining, production, and use of coal accounts for 42 percent of revenue in the Navajo Nation's General Fund. 3 The Navajo have also historically embraced  their  coal  resources  to  promote  their  own  sovereignty  within  the overarching colonial and capitalist structures they have been subjected to for most of America's history. 4 Coal-related economic activity provides thousands of  well-paying  jobs  for  Navajo  members  living  on  or  near  their  reservation, 5 which has a 48.5 percent unemployment rate. 6 Navajo political leaders argued that the new plant, called Desert Rock, would serve a vital role in stabilizing their economy given plans to phase out existing power plants in the coming decades. 7",body_text,226,309,779,550,553,241,3,california_law_review_Social_Justice_Conflicts_in_Public_Law

For  an  attorney,  a  federal  clerkship  is  a  prestigious  opportunity  offering invaluable training and a behind-the-scenes look at the federal court system. 143 Mentorship from a federal judge can help young lawyers excel in the legal field and become 'leaders in the profession.' 144 Clerkships are also often viewed as a prerequisite to competitive jobs in legal academia. 145 Similarly, large law firms often offer substantial bonuses and high-ranking positions to former clerks, as they attract clients and bolster the firm's prestige. 146 This wealth of opportunities may even lead former clerks themselves to become judges. 147 For example, six of  the  nine  current  Supreme  Court  justices  were  once  Supreme  Court  clerks themselves. 148 It is possible to go far in the legal field without a clerkship, but clerks certainly have an advantage over non-clerks, 149 as '[t]he legal profession prizes access to judges and uses clerkships as a professional proxy to determine",body_text,226,256,779,497,553,241,18,california_law_review_Access_Without_the_ADA_The_Implications_of_the_Federal_Judiciarys_Exemption_from_Following_the_Disab

Animals and plants face risks not just from humans but from other flora and fauna.

"The  overwhelming  breadth  of  these  consequences  makes  it  tempting  to reject an individual-animal-based lens as unworkable, but the scale of environmental law's impact on individual wild animals is all the more reason to begin  engaging  with  difficult  trade-offs  now.  Agency  reasoning  in  removal analyses reflects a powerful, if amorphous, intuition that individual wild animals have some moral standing, despite conservation's focus on protecting collectives. Ignoring that hunch would neglect a key reason that Americans and their government value nature in the first place. 19 When an agency protects a woodland, it not only protects a carbon sink or an arresting vista, but the ability of a thousand squirrels to wake up in the morning and savor a thousand nuts.

"There exists  no  conflict-of-law  principle  for  deciding  among  competing separation-of-powers  theories,  especially  when  courts  draw  from  conflicting theoretical frameworks to resolve modern separation-of-powers controversies. Different theories have risen and fallen, but no one theory has been fixed or liquidated  through  custom  or  historical  practice. 27 Indeed,  the  same  styles  of legal  reasoning-arguments  based  on  text  and  structure  and  history-have supported  different constitutional  theories.  The  General  Law  theory,  for example, expressly subordinates questions about ambiguous constitutional terms in  order to consult customary practices that reflect exogenous patterns of our political, electoral, and  economic  lives.  The  persistence  of  pluralism  in separation-of-powers  debates  does  not  suggest  that  constitutional  theory  is  a confused  muddle  that  cannot  be  resolved,  but  rather  that  the  Constitution's indeterminacy leaves apparent separation-of-powers settlements open to reinterpretation and reinvention. 28",body_text,226,378,779,603,553,225,7,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

Payment is based on the fair market value of the undamaged item; the transfer of the thing itself will credit back any remaining value to the new owner. 115 Disagreements about the extent of the damage need not be entertained, nor must the erstwhile owner bear the risk that the condition of the thing will deteriorate further as a result of additional hidden vulnerabilities (such as hairline fractures in a vase).",body_text,160,317,851,534,691,217,27,columbia_forcings

"Abstract: On July 19, 2023, in Juniper v. Davis , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit fashioned a two-step process for analyzing the cumulative materiality of alleged violations of Brady v. Maryland (failure to disclose favorable evidence) and Napue v. Illinois (knowing presentation of false evidence). These two types of prosecutorial misconduct are frequently alleged together, creating an analytical challenge for reviewing courts because each type of violation is governed by a different standard of materiality. The Fourth Circuit combined elements of the Ninth and Second Circuits' approaches to this analytical challenge, creating a test that allows for certain evidence to be reviewed under the more permissive Napue materiality standard while preserving the stricter Brady materiality test for subsequent review, should the first step fail to show materiality. This Comment argues that although the Fourth Circuit's approach offers a salutary liberalization of the post-conviction review of intertwined Brady and Napue claims, it does not dispense with the fundamental flaws of the Brady materiality standard. Rather, courts examining cumulative materiality of Brady and Napue evidence should do so entirely under the Napue standard-a solution that would ameliorate analytical challenges for courts and militate toward more consistent and just results.",body_text,150,249,884,577,734,328,1,boston_college_law_review_Untitled

"The recent 'reviv[al]' of general-law scholarship asks whether 'general law' should be rehabilitated for modern constitutional rights and federal courts doctrines. 175 For  example,  Professors  William  Baude  and  Stephen  E.  Sachs recently interpreted the Eleventh Amendment as leaving in place the general law that preceded it, including structural limitations on jurisdiction 'properly derived from the common law and the law of nations.' 176 Professor Sachs has called for the overturning of Erie altogether as part of a project that would revise the law of  personal  jurisdiction  and  its  related  'battles  between  'sovereignty'  and 'liberty.'' 177",body_text,226,305,779,447,553,142,36,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

"Most directly, the Brand Registry has changed the incentives to register trademarks.  The  American  trademark  system  is  use-based:  Trademark  rights arise  out  of  use,  not  registration,  and  registration  in  the  U.S.  Patent  and Trademark  Office  (PTO)  simply  records  those  rights  and  provides  certain enforcement benefits. 8 But because unregistered marks have long been enforceable under federal law on largely the same terms as registered marks, 9 unregistered  rights  have  often  been  perfectly  adequate  for  many  smaller businesses. Indeed, the availability of those unregistered rights has traditionally been  seen  as  a  benefit  of  the  American  system  for  small  and  medium-sized businesses. 10",body_text,226,323,779,481,553,158,4,california_law_review_Amazons_Quiet_Overhaul_of_the_Trademark_System

Rather, these are sets of necessary conditions, which may or may not be sufficient in a given instance to justify the use of government power. It is also obviously possible for the government to engage in the acts named in the chart when the conditions are not met-as where eminent domain inefficiently moves property to a lower-valuing user. The point of the chart is not to assert that government always or only engages in these acts when the stated conditions are met, but rather to suggest that these conditions would form a minimum predicate for an appropriate exercise of the specified governmental power.",footnote,160,746,851,885,691,139,35,columbia_forcings

"But evolving political dynamics destabilized whatever earlier settlements may  have  existed  during  the  Washington  Administration.  By  the  1820s,  an increase in the frequency of removal caused the voting public to take a 'violent exception' to the emerging patronage system. 230 The concern was that competent officers were being removed to make room for favored appointees of each new presidential administration. Legislative proposals during this period failed, but the opposition they faced turned, once again, on pragmatic arguments.

"Despite the different normative justifications for different  separation-ofpowers theories, we lack any conflict-of-law principle for deciding which value across history should be preeminent or authoritative. Until we arrive at such a principle, separation of powers will remain fragmented and unpredictable. Of course,  when  we  pick  and  choose  among  structural  theories,  we  are  often searching for evidence of liquidation. Yet over the long course of constitutional history, the reality is that when we choose one constitutional precedent, we create a  mishmash of different theories, and in doing so, we discard other plausible options. When we do settle on a precedent, the act of analogizing it to the present often ignores the theoretical underpinnings of the doctrines we so routinely draw on in contemporary constitutional debates.",body_text,226,338,779,513,553,175,63,california_law_review_Structural_Indeterminacy_and_the_Separation_of_Powers

"In 2023, in Juniper v. Davis , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit established an innovative two-step process for assessing the cumulative materiality of Brady and Napue claims. The court's cumulative materiality analysis combines insights from previous approaches and expands the body of evidence to which it applies the more permissive Napue analysis. Although the Fourth Circuit's two-step test liberalizes the post-conviction review of intertwined Brady and Napue claims, it also preserves the fundamental flaws inherent in the modern Brady materiality standard. Courts would do better to dispense entirely with the Brady materiality standard for cumulative materiality analysis and instead examine all such claims under the Napue standard.",body_text,124,182,909,378,785,196,20,boston_college_law_review_Untitled

"Revisiting Table 2 with these observations in mind reveals three points relevant to forced ownership. First, many situations that might initially appear to reside in Cells II or VI-where ownership is privately aversive but socially desirable-may not really fit in those boxes at all if ownership itself, as opposed to the imposition of a particular payment obligation, adds no social value. Second, the law has at its disposal many means to move situations out of those cells, short of forcing ownershipwhether by altering the private payoffs to ownership or refining ownership in ways that change its social payoffs. Third, some of these legal mechanisms, such as taxes and subsidies, may help to reveal which cell a particular situation actually resides within by eliciting information about how much a particular party desires ownership or nonownership. If society properly sets the price for entering into or ending ownership, A 's choice to pay and proceed demonstrates an alignment between her preferred ownership arrangement and the social optimum. 179",body_text,146,461,837,712,691,251,42,columbia_forcings

Identifying an owner means something different from imposing a charge: It is an answer to the question, 'Whose problem is this?' 113 There are sensible reasons why the law might choose to answer that question, rather than a series of other questions about the nature, extent, probable solution, and expected value of the problem.

"Consider instead a 'flyaway' crop that predictably lands a quarter mile southwest of where it is sown. Here, the story does not work so well, unless the property is redefined to include the catchment area, or the crops themselves can somehow be associated with their sower. 149 Allowing the crop-landing zone to be owned on its own does not align incentives (no one would bother sowing); incentives similarly fall out of alignment if the crops stay put on the owned land but sprout noxious traveling spores whose effects are not charged back to the owner. Property boundaries must be set in a way that produces incentive alignment, or must be buttressed with governance structures that stand in for physical boundaries where the latter cannot realistically be employed. 150 Property's social value, in other words, depends on package construction.",body_text,160,411,850,612,690,201,33,columbia_forcings

"But Amazon's model differs from Sears's in two key ways. First, just about any third-party business can partner with Amazon to sell any of its wares on Amazon's  platform. 330 By  contrast,  Sears  would  internally  determine  which products it  wanted to sell  and  then  solicit  particular  third-party  businesses  to manufacture those items. Second, Amazon has considerably more power vis-àvis small businesses than Sears did. Businesses operating in Sears' heyday could still thrive without Sears by engaging in local commerce, which was then more prominent. 331 Sears therefore did not have the grip that Amazon has on thirdparty business practices.

"But it is not clear to us that we are yet at a point where the alternatives to trademarks  are  better.  Empirical  evidence  suggests  that  Amazon  consumer reviews  are  inaccurate  in  important  ways  (because  consumers  tend  to  write reviews only if they are extremely positive or negative), that consumers do not process reviews in cognitively accurate ways, and that as many as one in every three reviews are fake. 407 And of course the Amazon algorithm is not designed to neutrally provide the products consumers are really looking for. As we have noted,  Amazon  has  routinely  given  preference  to  its  own  products  in  search results  even  when  consumers  search  for  other  products  by  brand  name. Furthermore, it gives participants in the Brand Registry access to various search optimization  tools. 408 For  those  reasons,  one  might  reasonably  conclude  that trademark  law's  emphasis  on  source  designation  remains  important,  and  that Amazon's policies are undermining the incentives that trademark law properly creates.",body_text,226,272,779,497,553,225,71,california_law_review_Amazons_Quiet_Overhaul_of_the_Trademark_System

"2. Mandating Development Bundles. - Purchases might also be compelled where eminent domain is not in play. For example, in a case of purely private development, the government might wish to place more property under one owner's control than would be independently selected by the developer, perhaps to generate positive externalities for the surrounding area. Similarly, a local government might address the concerns of the surrounding community by allowing residents or businesses to force purchases of their properties on developers who would transform an area in ways that would make them wish to leave. Indeed, the government could extend such an option to local residents in conjunction with its own proposed exercises of eminent domain, allowing nearby landowners who were not part of the original condemnation plan to compel the government to buy up their properties as well. 253",body_text,146,158,837,376,691,218,60,columbia_forcings

"However, this proposal would not be a total panacea, given that agencies also  administer old statutes that are unlikely to be modified anytime soon. 297 When this occurs, agency consideration of mid-level justice principles depends on the specific statutory language. Some statutes explicitly use the language of justice,  such  as  the  widely  adopted  phrase  across  utilities  law  that  agencies should adopt rules that are 'just and reasonable.' 298 Oftentimes, statutes speak in general terms by saying that rules should be adopted 'in the public interest.' 299 Such statutory language provides textual justification for agencies that want to consider  social  justice.  Concerning  judicial  review,  reviewing  courts  have historically been deferential regarding agency interpretations of vague congressional purposes, absent explicit textual limitations. 300",body_text,226,223,779,398,553,175,56,california_law_review_Social_Justice_Conflicts_in_Public_Law

"Disabled jurors have the capacity to provide a unique 'perspective on human events' that is vital not only in ADA cases but in any case before the court. Disability arises in many aspects of the law and, without disabled representation, ableism may slip through the cracks. 167 Likewise, an increase in diversity will help juries make more thorough evaluations of evidence and participate more willingly  in  discussions  about  prejudice  and  discrimination  in  cases. 168 Jury composition also impacts the credibility and legitimacy of the court system. 169 Therefore, being exempt from the ADA threatens disability inclusion on juries, undermining the importance of having 'a fair cross section of the community.' 170",body_text,226,140,779,282,553,142,21,california_law_review_Access_Without_the_ADA_The_Implications_of_the_Federal_Judiciarys_Exemption_from_Following_the_Disab
