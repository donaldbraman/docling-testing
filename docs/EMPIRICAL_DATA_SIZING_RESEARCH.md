## 1. EMPIRICAL DATA SIZING RULES

### 1.1 Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Transformers

#### General BERT Fine-tuning
- **Absolute minimum:** 500 samples total (extreme few-shot)
- **Practical minimum:** 1,000 samples total across all classes
- **Per-class minimum:** 100 samples per class for acceptable performance
- **Recommended baseline:** 500-1,000 samples per class for solid results

**Sources:**
- Hugging Face community reports successful fine-tuning with 500-1,000 total samples
- Academic research shows 100 examples per category yields similar results to 500 for fixed-size models (performance plateau at ~100 examples)
- Rule of thumb: 1,000 examples minimum per task for avoiding overfitting

#### Few-Shot Learning Thresholds
- **True few-shot:** 10-40 samples per class
- **Uncertainty-aware self-training:** 20-30 labeled samples per class can achieve within 3% accuracy of fully supervised BERT
- **Diminishing returns:** Performance plateaus around 100 examples per category for smaller models

**Key Finding:** For AG News dataset, 100 examples per category yielded similar results to 500 examples per category, indicating diminishing returns beyond this threshold.

### 1.2 Document/Layout Classification Specifically

#### Document Understanding (UiPath Guidelines)
**Regular fields (metadata extraction):**
- Minimum: 20-50 document samples per field
- For 10 regular fields: 200-500 samples recommended
- For 20 regular fields: 400-1,000 samples recommended

**Column fields (table/structured data):**
- Minimum: 50-200 document samples per column field
- For 5 column fields (clean layouts): 300 documents minimum
- For complex/diverse layouts: 1,000+ documents required

**Important Note:** You do NOT need every layout represented in training. AI can generalize to unseen layouts - most production layouts may have 0-2 samples in training set.

#### Layout Semantic Segmentation
**DocLayNet dataset (production standard):**
- 80,863 manually annotated pages across 11 classes
- Created by 32 annotators over 3 months
- Provides inter-annotator agreement metrics for quality baselines

**Azure Document Intelligence:**
- Template model: Max 500 pages, 50MB training data
- Neural model: Max 50,000 pages, 1GB training data

### 1.3 Imbalanced Multi-Class Classification

#### Class Imbalance Thresholds
- **Modest imbalance:** 1:10 ratio (10:1 majority to minority)
- **Severe imbalance:** 1:100 ratio
- **Extreme imbalance:** 1:1000+ ratio

#### Imbalance Ratio Impact
**1:10 (modest):**
- Generally manageable with class weighting
- 10-20% minority class threshold commonly cited
- Can benefit from basic balancing techniques

**1:100 (severe):**
- Creates acute data scarcity for minority class
- With 100,000 total examples, only 1,000 in minority class
- Significant performance degradation without intervention
- Requires SMOTE, class weights, or threshold calibration

**Performance degradation:**
- Majority class accuracy can reach ~100%
- Minority class accuracy often 0-10% without balancing
- Skewed distribution causes learning process difficulties

#### Minimum Samples for Minority Classes
**Conservative estimates:**
- Minimum 50-100 samples for neural networks (basic rule)
- Recommended 100-500 samples for robust performance
- Ideal 500-1,000+ samples for production reliability

**Caution:** With extreme imbalance (1:100), even 1,000 minority samples may be insufficient without data augmentation or synthetic generation.

## 2. DOCUMENT AI LITERATURE

### 2.1 LayoutLM Family

#### LayoutLM (Original)
**Pre-training scale:**
- 500K document pages with 6 epochs
- 1M pages with 6 epochs
- 2M pages with 6 epochs
- 11M pages with 2 epochs (achieved F1: 0.7866)

**Fine-tuning datasets:**
- FUNSD: 149 training documents, 50 test documents (9,707 semantic entities)
- Typical fine-tuning: Can work with small task-specific datasets after pre-training

#### LayoutLMv3
**Benchmark datasets:**
- PubLayNet: 335,703 training images, 11,245 validation, 11,405 test (5 layout categories)
- FUNSD: 199 documents total (149 train, 50 test)
- CORD (receipts): 1,000 receipts (800 train, 100 val, 100 test)

**Fine-tuning approach:**
- Requires normalized bounding boxes (0-1000 range)
- Can fine-tune with "small amount of task-specific data"
- Real-world example: 220 annotated invoices for invoice processing

**Key insight:** Pre-training on massive datasets enables fine-tuning with dramatically smaller task-specific datasets.

### 2.2 Form/Document Understanding Datasets

#### RVL-CDIP (Document Image Classification Benchmark)
- **Total:** 400,000 grayscale images
- **Classes:** 16 document types
- **Distribution:** 25,000 images per class (perfectly balanced)
- **Split:** 320,000 train, 40,000 val, 40,000 test
- **Quality issues:** 8.1% label noise (1.6-16.9% per category), ambiguous documents, train-test overlap

#### FATURA (Invoice Dataset)
- **Total:** 10,000 invoices
- **Layouts:** 50 distinct layouts
- **Status:** Largest openly accessible invoice image dataset

#### ReceiptQA
- **Scale:** 171,000 question-answer pairs from 3,500 receipt images
- **Mix:** LLM-generated + human-annotated questions

#### Production Invoice Systems
- Research datasets: 45,000 invoice documents for large-scale studies
- IPR dataset: 1,500 scanned receipts (4 entity types)

### 2.3 Document Classification vs Page/Token Classification

#### Document-Level Classification
- **Advantages:** Efficient transformers (BigBird) excel with longer documents and fewer training examples
- **Challenge:** Standard BERT limited to ~400 words/tokens
- **Solution:** Specialized architectures for long documents, or hierarchical approaches

#### Token-Level Classification (NER, POS tagging)
- **Standard approach:** Fine-tune on established datasets (CONLL2003)
- **Works within:** Standard transformer token limits (512-1024 tokens)
- **Less data-hungry:** Can leverage pre-training more effectively for token-level tasks

**Key difference:** Document classification with long texts requires special handling and may need more data when using standard transformers, while token classification operates within standard limits.

## 3. TRANSFER LEARNING SPECIFICS

### 3.1 Pre-training's Impact on Data Requirements

#### Dramatic Data Reduction
- **From scratch:** 5,000-10,000+ examples per class typically needed
- **Transfer learning:** 10-100 examples per class can suffice
- **Fine-tuning BERT:** Get away with "much smaller amounts of training data" compared to scratch

#### Training Efficiency
- **Epochs:** Only 2-4 epochs recommended for BERT fine-tuning
- **Time:** Minutes to hours depending on dataset size
- **Early stopping:** Many trainings can stop after small number of passes

### 3.2 ModernBERT Fine-tuning Requirements

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Context length:** 8,192 tokens (vs 512 for original BERT)
- **Speed:** ~3x faster training than original BERT
- **Accuracy:** +3% better on challenging datasets

#### Data Requirements
- **Typical dataset:** 1,000 examples with balanced label distribution
- **Source requirements:** Long texts (2,000+ words minimum) from diverse sources
- **Practical example:** 15,000 synthetic prompts for 5 epochs achieved F1: 0.993 in 321 seconds

#### Data Generation
- Can use synthetic data from Wikipedia, Reddit, Common Crawl, forums, books, newspapers
- Requires varied length, diverse topics, validated labels
- Quality validation crucial before fine-tuning

### 3.3 Diminishing Returns Curves

#### ROI Pattern
- **ROI drops immediately** after first epoch of fine-tuning
- **Calculate ROI:** Relative improvement รท amount of labeled data
- **Key insight:** Transformers learn "so much, so fast, from so little data" that ROI drops quickly

#### Sample Efficiency
- **Few-shot capability:** Large improvements with only "few hundred items of labeled data"
- **Training time:** Only "few minutes" for significant gains
- **For larger models:** Rate of improvement is slower, showing diminishing returns more clearly

#### Practical Thresholds
- **50-100 samples:** Significant improvement (96% formatting accuracy)
- **Beyond 100:** Metrics stabilize for many tasks
- **1,000-2,000 samples:** Performance deterioration seen when starting this small
- **Substantial improvement:** Only as dataset increases beyond 2,000-5,000

**Translation task example:** Performance deteriorated with only 1K-2K examples, but substantial improvement observed as training dataset increased.

## 4. CLASS IMBALANCE THEORY

### 4.1 Minimum Ratios for Good Training

#### Acceptable Imbalance Levels
- **10-20% minority class:** Commonly cited threshold for "acceptable" imbalance
- **1:10 ratio:** Usually imbalanced enough to benefit from balancing techniques
- **Beyond 1:100:** Requires aggressive intervention (SMOTE, synthetic data, heavy class weighting)

#### Impact on Learning
- **Skewed distribution:** Main cause of performance degradation
- **Tendency:** Algorithms ignore or overfit minority classes when majority class dominates
- **Result:** Poor generalization, especially for minority classes

### 4.2 Minority Class Minimum Samples

#### Theoretical Minimums
- **10 times rule:** 10 samples per parameter/feature (multivariate statistics)
- **Neural network baseline:** 10 samples per class for transfer learning (image classification)
- **Practical floor:** 26 samples considered "very small" for real ML tasks

#### Recommended Minimums
**By approach:**
- **Transfer learning (pre-trained):** 10-50 samples per class minimum
- **Standard supervised learning:** "Few thousand samples per class" for very good performance
- **Production systems:** 1,000+ samples per class recommended

**By neural network complexity:**
- **10x weights rule:** ~10 training cases per weight in network
- **50x weights rule:** Minimum 50 times number of weights advised
- **VC dimension:** Usually around number of weights, suggests 10x is minimum

#### Important Caveat
"Impossible to answer in general" - actual requirements depend heavily on:
- Predictive feature strength
- Problem complexity
- Data quality
- Regularization techniques
- Model architecture

### 4.3 How Class Size Affects Generalization

#### Multi-class Complexity
- **Harder than binary:** Multi-class imbalanced learning "much harder" and "still an open problem"
- **Multiple minorities:** May have multiple minority AND majority classes
- **Relative imbalance:** A class can be minority compared to some classes, majority to others

#### Generalization Challenges
**With insufficient minority samples:**
- Overfitting to minority class patterns
- Failure to learn decision boundaries
- Brittle models sensitive to slight variations
- Poor performance on minority class in production

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Deliberate variability in training (scan/photograph documents at different resolutions)
- SMOTE and synthetic sampling
- Cost-sensitive methods (class weights)
- Ensemble methods
- Threshold calibration

## 8. REASONING FOR THRESHOLDS

### Why 100-500 Samples (Minimum Viable)?
1. **Transfer learning floor:** Pre-trained models need minimal task-specific data
2. **Empirical evidence:** 100 examples per class shows plateau effect
3. **Few-shot research:** 20-30 samples with uncertainty-aware training achieves 97% of full performance
4. **Risk:** High overfitting risk, unstable training, poor generalization

### Why 500-1,000 Samples (Solid Performance)?
1. **Academic consensus:** "Few thousand samples per class" for very good performance
2. **Practical validation:** Multiple studies show 500-1,000 as "sweet spot"
3. **Diminishing returns:** Beyond 1,000, gains become incremental
4. **Production readiness:** Sufficient for internal tools, testing, validation

### Why 1,000-5,000 Samples (Production-Grade)?
1. **Deep learning standard:** 5,000 labeled examples per category for human-level performance
2. **Robustness:** Sufficient diversity to handle production variability
3. **Generalization:** Enough data to learn decision boundaries reliably
4. **Industry practice:** Document AI systems typically use 1,000-10,000 samples

### Why 1:10 Imbalance Threshold?
1. **Statistical evidence:** 1:10 ratio commonly cited as "usually imbalanced enough to benefit from balancing"
2. **Performance data:** Beyond 1:10, minority class accuracy drops to 0-10% without intervention
3. **Practical observation:** 10-20% minority class = significant but manageable
4. **Technique effectiveness:** Class weighting alone often sufficient up to 1:10

### Why 1:100 Requires Intervention?
1. **Data scarcity math:** 100K total = only 1K minority samples
2. **Learning failure:** Algorithms tend to ignore minority class entirely
3. **Performance degradation:** Majority 100% accuracy, minority 0-10% accuracy
4. **Required techniques:** SMOTE, synthetic data, focal loss become necessary

## 9. APPLICATION TO CURRENT PROJECT

### Current Status (37,888 paragraphs, 7 classes)
**If evenly distributed:** ~5,413 samples per class
- **Well above** minimum viable (100-500)
- **Above** solid performance (500-1,000)
