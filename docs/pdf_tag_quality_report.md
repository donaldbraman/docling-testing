# PDF Structure Tag Quality Report

**Issue:** #28 - Evaluate PDF Structure Tag Quality and Completeness
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS BELOW

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

We analyzed **90 tagged PDFs** (42.1% of our 214-PDF collection) that claim to have internal semantic structure. **Important discovery: The tags exist but do NOT contain semantic labels for content.**

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tag coverage (% with tags) | 42.1% | N/A | ✓ Good |
| Content coverage (% of text tagged) | 0.0% | >80% | ❌ FAIL |
| Extractable structure | 37.8% | >70% | ❌ FAIL |
| Tag types found | 3 | N/A | ⚠️ Limited |
| Schema mapping | 100% | >85% | ✓ Excellent |
| Hierarchy depth | 0.8 avg | >2.0 | ❌ FAIL |

### Bottom Line Recommendation

**Tagged PDFs are NOT suitable as primary training ground truth** due to:
1. ❌ Zero direct text-to-tag mapping in structure trees
2. ❌ Shallow hierarchy (avg 0.8 levels) - mostly containers
3. ❌ Only 37.8% have meaningful extractable structure
4. ✓ BUT: Page text is available + structure hierarchy is clean

**Alternative: Use Docling extraction + validate against structure hierarchy** (see "Recommended Approach" below)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Tag Coverage Analysis

**Finding:** 90/214 PDFs have structure trees (42.1% coverage)

- ✓ Good representation across journals:
  - Michigan (100% of PDFs tagged): 15 samples
  - Harvard (58.8%): 10 tagged
  - Fordham (80%): 8 tagged
  - Georgetown (100%): 5 tagged
  - Plus 40+ individual samples from other journals

#### Coverage by Producer Software

| Producer | Count | Avg Coverage | Quality |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Prince 15.4.1 | 12 | 0.0% | Shallow but consistent |
| PDFlib+PDI 9.0.3 | 15 | 0.0% | Shallow but consistent |
| Aspose.PDF .NET | 10 | 0.0% | Shallow but consistent |
| Prince 15.2 | 10 | 0.0% | Shallow but consistent |
| Adobe PDF Library 15.0 | 10 | 0.0% | Shallow but consistent |

**Interpretation:** All producers create structure trees but with **zero content coverage** - they're hierarchy shells without text.

---

### 2. Tag Type Inventory and Mapping

**Found tag types:**
- `/Document` (33 PDFs, 36.7%) - Document root
- `/Part` (25 PDFs, 27.8%) - Major document part
- `/Sect` (19 PDFs, 21.1%) - Section/subsection

**Schema Mapping:**

| PDF Tag | Maps To | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `/Document` | `cover` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes - contains title/cover on first elements |
| `/Part` | `section` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Reasonable - major document divisions |
| `/Sect` | `section` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Reasonable - subsections |

**Mapping Rate:** 100% (3/3) ✓ - All found tags map cleanly to our 7-class schema

**Problem:** These are STRUCTURAL tags, not SEMANTIC tags:
- No tags for `body_text`, `heading`, `footnote`, `caption`, etc.
- No tags distinguish between article content types
- Structure tree is essentially a table of contents, not content labels

---

### 3. Content Coverage Analysis

**CRITICAL FINDING: 0% Content Coverage**

```
Coverage Statistics:
  Minimum:      0.0%
  Maximum:      0.0%
  Mean:         0.0%
  Median:       0.0%

Distribution:
  0-20%:  90 PDFs (100.0%) ❌
  20-40%:  0 PDFs (  0.0%)
  40-60%:  0 PDFs (  0.0%)
  60-80%:  0 PDFs (  0.0%)
  80-100%: 0 PDFs (  0.0%)
```

**Why 0%?** The structure tree tags (`/Document`, `/Part`, `/Sect`) are container elements but contain **NO TEXT** themselves. Text exists in the PDF (we can extract it via Docling) but it's NOT embedded in the structure tree.

**Threshold Analysis:**
- Threshold 1: >70% of PDFs with >80% coverage → **0.0% FAIL** ❌
- Result: Tags are structural placeholders, not content labels

---

### 4. Extraction Feasibility

**Analysis:** What can we actually extract from these structure trees?

```
PDFs with extractable structure: 34/90 (37.8%) ⚠️
Average hierarchy depth: 0.8 levels
Estimated blocks per PDF: 1-3 (mostly empty)
```

**Sample findings:**

| PDF | Depth | Tags | Blocks | Page Text | Status |
|-----|-------|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| boston_college_1.pdf | 2 | `/Document`, `/Sect` | 2 | 96KB | Extractable |
| michigan_1.pdf | 3 | `/Document`, `/Part`, `/Sect` | 3 | 150KB | Extractable |
| harvard_1.pdf | 1 | `/Sect` | 1 | 120KB | Limited |

**Key insight:** Even "extractable" PDFs produce only 1-3 blocks because the hierarchy is SHALLOW - it's just sectioning, not detailed content structure.

**Extraction Threshold:**
- Threshold 4: >100 samples per PDF on average → **~1.5 samples/PDF FAIL** ❌
- The structure tree would yield minimal training samples (90 PDFs × 1.5 samples = ~135 total)

---

### 5. Reconstruction Feasibility

**Good news:** While structure tags aren't content labels, we CAN reconstruct useful training data:

**Option A: Docling-based (Recommended)**
```
1. Extract text blocks from PDFs using Docling
   → Yields ~2,000 blocks from 90 PDFs (20-30 blocks/PDF)
   → Includes spatial features (bboxes)
   → Includes Docling's inferred labels (body, heading, etc.)

2. Validate using structure hierarchy
   → `/Document` blocks likely contain titles/cover
   → `/Sect` blocks likely contain headings/structured content
   → Compare Docling labels against structure hierarchy

Result: ~1,800 confident training samples
Confidence: Medium (Docling inference + structure validation)
```

**Option B: Manual tagging**
```
Extract from 34 "good" PDFs (those with deep hierarchies)
Manually label text blocks based on visual inspection
Result: ~500 high-confidence samples
Confidence: High (manual verification)
```

**Option C: HTML-PDF pairs (Current approach)**
```
Use existing 214 HTML-PDF pairs
Use HTML semantic labels as ground truth
Result: ~3,200 training samples
Confidence: High (HTML semantic markup)
```

## Comparative Analysis: Tagged PDFs vs. HTML-PDF Pairs

| Factor | Tagged PDFs | HTML-PDF Pairs | Winner |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Completeness** | 0% (text not in tags) | ~95% (HTML tags all text) | HTML ✓ |
| **Granularity** | 3 tag types (structural) | 7+ tag types (semantic) | HTML ✓ |
| **Accuracy** | Unknown (no text-tag mapping) | High (browser-parsed HTML) | HTML ✓ |
| **Sample yield** | ~1.5/PDF | ~15/PDF | HTML ✓ |
| **Usability** | Requires reconstruction | Direct extraction | HTML ✓ |
| **Coverage** | 90 PDFs | 214 PDF-HTML pairs | Pairs ✓ |
| **Semantic richness** | Container structure | Body, heading, footnote, citation | HTML ✓ |

**Conclusion:** HTML-PDF pairs are **dramatically superior** for training purposes.

## Recommendations

### ❌ Don't use tagged PDFs as primary ground truth
- Structure tags provide insufficient information
- Would require extensive reconstruction/inference
- HTML-PDF pairs already superior alternative

### ✓ Do use tagged PDFs for validation
- 34 "good" PDFs with decent hierarchy could be used to:
  - Validate Docling's label inference
  - Cross-check HTML semantic labels
  - Identify edge cases

### ✓ Do use HTML-PDF pairs for training
- Existing 214 pairs → ~3,200 training samples
- High-quality semantic labels (from HTML)
- Spatial features (from PDF bounding boxes)

### Optional: Docling-based labeled corpus
- Extract from all 90 tagged PDFs using Docling
- Use structure hierarchy to validate Docling labels
- Result: ~1,800 additional samples (medium confidence)
- Use as secondary/augmentation data

## Quality Assessment Summary

### Success Thresholds (from Issue #28)

| Threshold | Target | Result | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1. Coverage | >70% PDFs with >80% content coverage | 0.0% | ❌ FAIL |
| 2. Accuracy | >80% of tags match ground truth | Unknown (no text-tag mapping) | ⚠️ N/A |
| 3. Mapping | >85% tags map to 7-class schema | 100% | ✓ PASS |
| 4. Yield | >100 samples/PDF | ~1.5 | ❌ FAIL |

**Verdict:** 1/4 thresholds met → **NOT SUITABLE FOR TRAINING**

---

## Implementation Notes

### For validation / cross-checking:
Use Docling on 34 "deep hierarchy" PDFs:
```python
from docling import DocumentConverter
from pathlib import Path

# Extract from best-tagged PDFs
good_pdfs = [p for p in pdfs if hierarchy_depth[p] >= 2]

for pdf_path in good_pdfs:
    # Extract with Docling
    doc = DocumentConverter.convert(str(pdf_path))
    blocks = doc.document.blocks

    # Cross-check against structure hierarchy
    # Use structure tags to validate Docling labels
```

### For report visualization:
See `data/pdf_tag_visualization.html` for color-coded sample content from 20 tagged PDFs.

## Conclusion

The tagged PDFs have **structure but not semantics**. The structure trees define document hierarchy (/Document → /Part → /Sect) but do NOT label semantic content (body_text, heading, footnote, etc.).

**Usability for training: ❌ 3/10**
- ✓ Structure hierarchy exists
- ✓ All tags map to schema
- ❌ Zero content coverage
- ❌ Shallow hierarchy (avg 0.8 levels)
- ❌ Minimal sample yield (~1.5/PDF)
- ❌ No semantic labels for content

**Better alternatives:**
1. ✓ Use existing HTML-PDF pairs (214 pairs, ~3,200 samples)
2. ✓ Collect more diverse non-law PDFs (100-300 pairs)
3. ⚠️ Optionally use Docling extraction from these 90 PDFs as secondary data
