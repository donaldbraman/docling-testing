The Role of  the  Prosecutor

in  Criminal  Procedure

DUANE R. NEDRUD*

INTRODUCTION

What  is  the  role  of the  public  prosecutor in  criminal procedure?  Such a topic  is  obviously broad  in  its scope and each of  us  may have  a  specific topic in  mind which we believe should be covered.  It  will  be attempted  here,  however, to take  in chronological order  from complaint  through  appeal, certain topics that can  at  least "paint" some sort of  completed  picture, if  certain trial procedures are  avoided,  involving the  introduction and  exclusion of  certain evidence. These  subjects cannot be treated generally, and although  opinion  may  vary,  there  are usually only  two views,  the  right and the  wrong,  both  of  which are  more or  less uniform  among  the  various  state and federal courts.

For  the  most  part this article will be in  the  nature of  a  survey of  the  criminal procedure  rules and statutes of the  fifty states. The federal rules and statutes are  listed in  the  appendix  as  an example.  A  surprising revelation of this survey  will  come  to those who believe their system  is  the only  one  and  that any other method of dispensing justice is obviously  inept, unconstitutional or  unworkable. In  "those"  probably will be included all of  us,  as we, for  the  most part, are  slaves to one of  two state procedures plus  possibly the  federal criminal procedure.

Where my opinions are  inevitable, may they  be  blamed  upon practical experience and  association with  those having  such  practical experience in  the  field, plus those  writings which have  had a  profound  influence upon me,  but  whose  ideas are incorporated with  lack  of  specific intent to  plagiarize, and thus  are not  noted  as  authority.

I. ARREST, COMPLAINT AND PRELIMINARY HEARINGS*

A  large  percentage of  criminal prosecutions begin  with  the arrest of  the  individual without a warrant by some law  enforcement officer during  the investigation. The other  great  bulk of  criminal cases  begin  on the  complaint  of the  victim  or  a police officer and warrant  issued  thereon. The prosecutor has little control over  the  processing of the criminal case which begins  with  an arrest by the  law enforcement officer. He  may refuse to approve,  either by direct right of the  statute or by the  indirect pressure, to  countenance a complaint  by the  magistrate. In  the  latter case the  magistrate will  usually go along with  whatever  the  prosecutor wants,  whether  there be statutory authority or  not. However, in  some states, the  prosecutor does not first approve or necessarily even know  that a complaint is  being  issued and is  called in  after the  fact.' There  are  some cases  which are  started directly with  indictment by the  grand jury, which  we will take up  in  the  next  section.

In  cases  where there is  an arrest on a warrant  issued in  conjunction with  a complaint or  where there is  an  arrest without a warrant, a preliminary hearing, or  as  it is  sometimes  called, preliminary examination, is  required. It is  usually a condition precedent to the  filing of an information. Differing from the indictment, if  it is  not  held  or  waived,  the  information may  be

quashed. 3  The preliminary hearing is  usually conducted by the prosecuting attorney, who  will  be trying the  case  when  it is bound over to  the  trial court, except  in  those  states in  which there  is  an "inferior" office  to the  prosecutor, where preliminary  hearings for  felonies and the trial of misdemeanors are handled. 4 It  should  be noted  that when  we  are  talking about preliminary hearings we  are  concerned for  the  most part about felonies.'

The preliminary hearing has the  aspects of  being  the quid pro  quo for  the  indictment of  the  grand  jury, giving to  the  defendant the  opportunity to  have  someone other than  the  prosecutor or  police officer pass  upon  whether  or  not  there are  sufficient grounds  to hold  the defendant to answer in the  trial court  having  jurisdiction of the  offense. Its main value,  outside  of  eliminating a possible abuse  of  law  enforcement officials in  keeping  a  man  incommunicado for  a long  period of  time, is

the  possible benefit to the  defendant  to  take  a look into  the state's case  and  thus provide a  measure  of  discovery."

The accused who  is unable  to hire  a lawyer will  usually waive the  preliminary hearing as  the  magistrate has no authority  to  appoint an attorney for  the  defendant and he is  usually so informed. Thus,  the  accused  without funds  will  waive preliminary  examination  in order  to be arraigned in the trial court  which has that  authority. If  he wishes to plead  guilty without  the  aid  of  counsel, he again  has no reason  to  want a preliminary hearing, but  is anxious  to "get  it  over  with"  as quickly as  possible. This  applies only  to  felony cases, as in  misdemeanor cases  most states do not  have provision for  the  appointment  of  an attorney at  the  expense  of the  state or  a requirement  that  attorneys can be "drafted" to  defend  a person charged  with  a misdemeanor,  whether  by statute or  by actual practice.a

If a preliminary hearing is  demanded  the  state must present sufficient evidence  to  persuade  the  magistrate that it has  a  case, which probably  as a  practical matter  does not  require very much, the  statute having  rather loose  standards. 7 However,  such testimony can be recorded  and can be used for  impeachment purposes;  it can also  be used as evidence  should  one of the witnesses  die  or  become  incapacitated and the  need for  the witnesses testimony is  thus demonstrated. This, of  course, could work in  favor  of the  prosecution, but  the  defendant  can also put  on witnesses and thus  preserve testimony. The preservation of  testimony can  also  be made by deposition, which will be explained further under  the  discovery section of  this article.

II.  DISMISSAL: THE DISCRETION OF  THE PROSECUTOR

The prosecuting attorney probably  is  able  to  exercise what discretion he may have left to  him before  a complaint is  issued or  at  the  time  of  the  preliminary hearing. In  other words,  although the  statutes do not  provide  for  it, the  prosecuting attorney  may  merely  fail to approve a complaint  in the  magistrate court, or  fail to "prove up" a case  at  the  preliminary

hearings and/or move  to  dismiss the  complaint at  the  time  the preliminary hearing  is called. The  statutes are silent as to the  authority of  the  prosecutor to  do this; however,  it is  generally the  practice and may find  approval by innuendo  in  some statutes. Presumably  after the  complaint  has been issued  the prosecuting attorney must attend the  preliminary hearing  and supposedly the magistrate could  bind  the  defendant over  against the  wishes  of  the  prosecuting attorney.'

After  the  preliminary hearing, when the  defendant has  been bound over  to  the  trial court  of general  jurisdiction, the  authority of  the  prosecuting atorney  to  dismiss  is  often  couched in  statutory limitations requiring reasons  to  be given  why  an information is not filed  or an indictment pursued,  together with  the  obtaining of  the  trial court's approval."

After  the  indictment or  information has  been  found  or  filed, the  majority of statutes require the  approval  of the  judge  of the  trial court  before  it  can be dismissed.,, Where  the  state statute is  silent as to  the  right of the  prosecuting attorney to

WIs. STAT. § 955.17 (1959).  Judge approval  required if  District Attorney does  not  want to  file information after a preliminary hearing.

There are  statutes which provide  for  dismissal if  information or  indictment must be filed or  found  by a certain time  or term and be tried by certain time or  dismissed. E.g., ARiz. R. 236 provides  for  dismissal of  information if  not  filed within  thirty days  after arrest. CAL. PEN. CODE § 1382, 15  days after a person  has  been held  to  answer.

NEB. REv. STAT. § 25-1323  (1943).  Provides  that no record  shall  be kept when  a case  is  nol-prossed.

NEV. REV. STAT. § 173.150 (1961)  provides  court  can compel District Attorney  to  prosecute crime  in extreme cases, whatever  extreme  means.

dismiss a complaint  prior to  the  indictment or  information being filed, but  after the  defendant  is bound over  to the  trial court, it could  be logically implied  from  the  statutes requiring judicial approval of  dismissal of  the  indictment or  information that the  same is  true at  that stage of  the  prosecution. 12  It can  be noted  that the  court may dismiss the  indictment or  information on its  own  motion and does not require the motion of the prosecuting attorney. 1 "  There  may  be some rights of  appeal  in certain states should  the  judge  do this on his  own  motion,  so this would rarely be done except  on  the  motion  or  concurrence of  the  prosecuting attorney.'

Only infrequently the  judge  would require the  prosecuting attorney to  try a case  which he  moves  to  dismiss  and that as  a practical matter  the prosecuting attorney  has more  control over  the  disposition of  a criminal case  than  the  statute actually implies. This demonstrates, as many  of the statutes of the states seem to  do,  that there is  a distrust by the  public  or  the legislature of the prosecutor and thus  the  statutes couch the authority of  the  prosecutor with  the  requirement of  obtaining the  judge's approval, in  whom  more trust is  reposed. While,  as has  been stated, this restriction is  probably  more fictional than actual, there  are  some  ramifications where the  judge  may  be inclined to  be dictatorial. As  for  the  fear  of the  prosecutor, there  are  many  methods of  control without  such supervision, including the  right of  the  court, whether  by statute or  implied authority, to appoint  a  prosecuting attorney  if  he is absent when  the  court convenes  to try  a criminal case. 1 5  Most states also provide  by  statute for  the  dismissal of  a case  if  an information is  not  filed by the  prosecuting attorney or  if  an indictment is  not  found  at  the  term  of  court at  which the  defendant  has

been  arrested or  bound over  to  the  court. In  addition, the  case will be dismissed if it is  not  tried within a  certain time  after the filing of the  information, or the finding of the indictment.' 6 Seemingly, if  the  prosecutor is  neglectful of  his  duty, the  court could  appoint an  attorney with  the  powers  of  the  prosecutor to handle  that case,  which includes the  penalty oftentimes of  paying  the  court appointed  prosecuting attorney out  of the  regularly constituted prosecutor's salary. 7

III. THE ACCUSATION: INDICTMENTS AND INFORMATIONS

The indictment is the accusation in  writing found by the grand  jury. The pros  and cons of  the  grand  jury are  discussed in  innumerable  books and articles, all  of which are  rampant with  authority. In  order to  simplify the  discussion let me  point out  the  variances again  in  the  statutes and allow  the  reader  to arrive at  his  own  decision of  its worth, with  the  writer's opinion, gathered from experience and discussion with  prosecutors over  the  nation, as  a conclusion.

Grand juries are  provided for  in  every  state in  the  nation. In  some  states they  are the  exclusive charging  agency for  all criminal  offenses, although  usually  through  one  method or another  they  are  only  involved  in  accusations of  felonies. 18  In

other  states their exclusive  authority is  limited to the  more serious felonies, with concurrent accusatory powers with the prosecuting attorney, through  the information, of all  other crimes.1"  Generally, however,  crimes  can be charged by the grand  jury  through  indictment or in the  alternative with  an information by the prosecuting attorney." There are some

various  combinations of the  methods of accusation of crimes in  several states. 21

Where  there  is concurrent jurisdiction to accuse,  in most states the  grand  jury  is  seldom used and the  statutes make  it clear that a  grand  jury should  not  be called except  in  extreme emergencies.22 The number of  cases  which have been  appealed in  connection with  grand  juries would indicate that some states have not  called more than  one grand  jury  in  the  last twenty years.  In discussing the problem with prosecutors in many of  these  states, some of them have stated that  they  would not have any idea  of what they  would do with  a grand  jury  if  it were called. When  a grand  jury  has been called in  many  of those  states, it has been because  of  some  irregularities within governmental  offices  including possibly the  prosecuting attorney's office. 2 1  In some instances the  grand  jury has  either "gone wild" or  has cleared up the  rumors that may  have been circulating of  such  malfeasance in  office.24

The grand  jury  functions at  its best  in  the  large  metropolitan areas, and,  often in  those  states with  the  concurrent methods of accusation, it  will  be used in the  populous  counties, but  ignored in  the  rural counties.  It is  probable  that in  many of  the  states where a defendant has  the  right to  be indicted by a grand  jury, that in  the  rural areas  the  defendants waive this right and grand  juries are  rarely called. In  most states requir-

ing  an  indictment by the  grand  jury, such  a  constitutional right can be waived except  in  certain instances involving capital offenses."

How does the  grand  jury  arrive at  finding an indictment? Generally it is  by bringing before  the  jury witnesses to  alleged crimes  of  which the  prosecuting attorney has been informed or  is cognizant, and wishes either to prosecute  or,  in some cases,  not to prosecute. These witnesses  testify as  to their knowledge of the  alleged crime,  which testimony is  recorded. The witnesses are  usually questioned by the  prosecuting attorney with  additional questions asked  by members  of  the  grand jury. In the large  offices one or more  assistants are usually assigned to  handle  all cases  before the  grand  jury  and a certain attachment  to this  prosecutor is natural. He  unquestionably becomes  the  advisor, as by statute he is  supposed  to  be,  and is  more or  less  the  leader."  It would be improper  to  say that the  grand  jury  members  are  merely pawns of the  prosecutor, but  as  a  practical matter they  must  be  and  should be dependent upon the  prosecutor for the  cases  which they  investigate. 8

There  is  a  provision for another accusation in  writing by the grand  jury  in  many  statutes which is  called  a presentment. 29

A  simple  definition of the  presentment is that  it is  the  same as an indictment (in many  statutes it  is  treated synonymously as such)  except  that the  case  originated within  the  grand  jury itself rather than by matters  which have been prompted by the  prosecuting attorney. 3 In other  state statutes and constitutions it  is  obvious  that  the  historical distinction between a presentment and indictment has been lost  and its  continued use merely adds to the  confusion. It  suffices to say that  presentment  in  its technical sense, whether  or  not  called an  indictment,  is  frowned upon and the  statutes, cases  and authorities indicate that there  is  little place  for  the  so-called "runaway" grand  jury, except  as a possibility in the background  which may have  some psychological effect upon the  prosecuting attorney,  partisan politics and the  criminal element. The need of such is, however,  so remote as not  to  justify the  use of the grand  jury for  that reason  alone.

There is  a running controversy as to  whether  or not  grand juries have  power to  give  reports. Typically, reports are  called for  in  inspection of  public jails and buildings, but  there  is  a limitation to  that phase  of  investigation. If  a grand  jury makes a "report" as distinguished from an indictment, there  is no defense  that can be made  and the  person  or  persons or  a com-

munity  may  be maligned  without  being  able  to  counter  such a "report." '

The grand  jury  is supposed  to receive only  legal  evidence and to  base  its  indictment upon legal evidence. 3 2 It  is  not  required  to  hear  the  defendant's side  of  the  case,  but  it is  often cautioned by statute that it should  hear  the  defendant's side  if the  evidence  of  guilt can be explained away. 33  The grand  jury then  takes a  vote on  whether  or  not  there is  sufficient evidence  so that the  defendant could  be convicted if  charged."  If  a certain number or  percentage of the  grand  jurors vote for  an indictment a "true  bill" is  returned. The number of grand  jurors required for  an indictment is  proportionate to  the  number of persons  required to  be  on a grand  jury, which varies from six to  twenty-three. 3

The grand jury  and indictments are provided  for  in the state constitutions as  well  as  the  Federal Constitution, although the  Federal  Constitution, as far  as it has been so interpreted, does not  require the  states to  use  the  grand  jury, but  the  state

is  rather controlled by its own  constitution or  laws. 36  Although considered a right, historically the  grand  jury was  to  give  the King an advantage  of at  least nominal  communal  accusation of  crime. 3 7  As it developed, its use  was deemed beneficial to  the rights of the  individual. Its use was blindly continued  in  the Constitutions of the  United  States and the  states. Whether its continued  existence is  really necessary, with the expense and cumbersome methods of  arriving at  an  accusation, is  very  questionable. Most  authorities and prosecuting attorneys would agree that it  is  more  of  a nuisance  than  an assistance. Most prosecuting attorneys would be reluctant o  make  such  a statement because,  like  so many  institutions, it  is considered by some a "sacred  cow" which cannot  be touched  without raising an indignatious uproar, which is  based  upon the  unwarranted belief that its disappearance will help  develop  a  "police state."

Such concern  by the  public  stirred up by those  who  generally are  uninformed  does point  out  some  of its  usefulness. Psychologically the  public  can believe  that some  of its  own members, in  the  form of the  grand  jury, control whether  or not  there will  be a charge  and who  will or  will  not  be prosecuted. The theory  is  that this will prevent the  prosecutor and the  police from both  becoming oppressive and/or lax  in  their prosecutions. This  country  was born in  distrust of too  much authority and the  idea  continues today. If  there is  a bona fide basis  for  such  a need  no one would question the  value  of  the grand  jury. The facts can be demonstrated that the  grand  jury influence is  not  to  any appreciable degree  a restraining influence upon possible abuse by a prosecuting attorney or  of the police. Rather  it might  be said  that many prosecutors can and do use the  jury  to  remove  their office  from any "heat"  generated  by the  victim  or a crusading group that will  demand a prosecution in  a case  where  the  prosecutor knows  he does not  have a chance to  convict. In  our  elective system of  selecting  prosecutors this can be very beneficial, not just  to  keep the  prosecutor from being  thrown out  of  office, often  unjustifiably by an uninformed  public, but  also  to  prevent  someone who  should  not  be prosecuted from being  put  into  the  position  of  having  to defend  himself. There are  other  methods which will put  a prosecutor in  a  position to  administer justice impartially, but  as yet  we  evidently are  not  willing to  accept

them. 8 Of course, there  are  differing views on what methods should  be  used  to  achieve  that result. Regardless, we  still must depend upon the  integrity and ability of the  official in office and  the  better method would seem to  be  to  endow such  official with  such authority, duty and responsibility that  it will  enhance the  obtaining and retaining of an official with  those  attributes. Surely, we  have learned  that  you  cannot legislate morals.

There is  little question that the  prosecuting attorney is  the most powerful  public  officer with direct effect upon the individual. It  is  within his  power,  regardless of the  fictional restraints of  the  statute, to  ruin  an individual by prosecution, to allow  the  community  to  be law abiding or to  be sold  out  to the  forces of  crime. If  the  grand  jury or  other methods,  which are  ostensibly used to keep the  prosecutor from being  a "tyrant," would in  fact  do so there  would be no argument,  but this is  not  the  case.

IV. THE INFORMATION

The information is the pleading used in the  charging  of crimes  in  most instances. Almost every state allows  its use or even requires its use  or  the  equivalent in  cases  of  misdemeanors. 8 ' 9  As  previously stated, the  concurrent usage with indictment in  felonies is most common.  In filing the information the  prosecuting attorney merely is  charging  the  crime in  the same words and with  the  same  notice as that used in  the  indictment. The only  difference, which  is  obvious,  is that  the prosecuting attorney takes  full responsibility for  filing or  failure  to  file an information which must  be  signed  by  him.  Sometimes  there  are provisions for  a complaining  witness  also  to verify the  information. 4 0 The prosecutor is  protected in  filing an information in  his  official capacity and may verify the  same

on information and  belief.41 One of  the  alleged disadvantages or advantages that occur  as previously mentioned, is  that the  preliminary examination  is  always  required in  felony charges  and thus  the  prosecutor must  or  could  be required to  give  sufficient evidence  to  the  defendant and his  attorney about  the  case in order  to  satisfy the  magistrate that he should  be bound over to  the  trial court. The defendant is  not  present at  the  investigation  and questioning of witnesses  by  the grand  jury,  but must be present at  the  preliminary hearing. Actually, if  this matter  of indictment versus  information were  debated,  the strict use of the information and  the preliminary hearing would give  greater safeguards to the individual than  the indictment  by the grand  jury. However, again  those  who  misunderstand look  only  to  the face  of  the laws  and  see  advantages one way  or  the  other. The unfortunate aspect  of statutes and laws,  and even in  their construction by the  court, is  that they often  belie the  fact that  their actual and practical use differs from the ostensible safeguard  that  would  seem  obvious in reading  the  statute or the  case  so  construing the  statute. This is  clearly demonstrated in  the  conflict of  the  information versus the  indictment.

In  some  instances, before  the  prosecuting attorney can file an information, he must obtain approval  of the  trial judge  of the  court of  general jurisdiction, who by statute, at  least, is  required  to  look  into the  proof of  the  matter in  a  form of  second preliminary hearing, and becomes a form of "one man  grand jury." 42  While no one questions that  a judge  should  be able to  quash  an information or indictment or  dismiss a case if  he so decides as  a matter of  law that it is  insufficient, again  there is  a great deal  of  question whether  this separation of the  two functions of prosecuting and the  decision making should  be connected  in  the  manner of  a so-called "one man  grand  jury" system.

V. DISCOVERY PROCEDURES

We  have made great strides in  civil procedure to  allow  cases to  be  an  open  book  to  both  sides. The use  of  discovery methods in  civil procedure  has  unquestionably improved the  methods of  arriving at  the  truth, and in  the  larger sense  of  seeing  that justice is done.  It  has removed, at  least to some  extent, the ability of  a lawyer  to  win a  case by his  wit, use  of  technicalities and delaying tactics and other  methods of wearing  down  the

opposition, especially where there  is  no defense  or  cause  of  action. The same argument is  used that  there  should  be more discovery procedures in  criminal cases. 43

There are  stumbling blocks  in criminal cases  that make  a difference from  their civil counterparts, including "importance," the lawyer involved  and the tactics used.  "Importance"  may well  be more of  a reason  to  promulgate  discovery  procedures in  criminal cases.

Let us first look  at  the  discovery procedures  that are  available. (1) It  is  a  frequent requirement that the  indictment and information be subscribed with  the  witnesses which the  state intends to  use in  its case  in  main."  Only if  the  judge, in  his discretion, believes that  the  state has shown sufficient reason for  endorsing  additional witnesses  on  the  charging  pleading after its filing, will  additional witnesses be allowed  to  be so  endorsed  and thus  used by the  state. The state often  can use other witnesses not  so endorsed  to  rebut the  defense, but  this is  on the  theory  that the  prosecution cannot  be expected  to anticipate what the  defense  may be.  The endorsing of  the  witnesses  by  the  state gives  to the  defendant  a measure of the state's case.  There is  nothing  preventing the lawyers  for  the defense  from contacting and questioning such witnesses, except  their natural reluctance to talk. (2) Depositions may  be taken  of  witnesses by the  defense  and by the  state. This  is  usually  only  for  the  purpose  of  preserving testimony  or taking testimony of  witnesses that cannot  come under  the  jurisdiction of  the  court or  are  in  some way incapacitated? 5  Although  seemingly  so limited, a rather liberal attitude on the  part  of the courts will allow  a certain measure of  discretion in  the  taking of  a  deposition which can  be used  for  discovery purposes. Even if  it cannot  be used in  evidence  if the  witnesses are  available, the  deposition can be used to  impeach witnesses for  inconsistency in  their testimony. (3) We  have  already mentioned  that the  preliminary hearings  can and are  basically used for  discovery  purposes  by defense  attorneys. (4)  There are  also  several  statutes and court  rulings which allow  the  obtaining of statements, photographs  and other materials in  criminal cases which in their civil counterpart might not be allowed as a possible "work product"  limitation. This includes provisions for  allowing judges  to  inspect certain prior statements made

by state witnesses or  informers which could  be made  available to  the defense  attorney if in  the  court's opinion it is  warranted.4 7

On  the  other side  of the  coin, the  defense  is  required in  a few states to  give  advance notice  if  an "alibi" will  be used.' 8 Also,  in  some states there is  a  requirement of  notice or  a plea of  "not  guilty by reason  of  insanity" to  be given  as  a prerequisite to  the  use  of  the  defense  of  insanity. " 9  These,  of  course, give the  state the  chance to prepare  to meet these  defenses, which otherwise  may  require delay  in  finding witnesses or in the  case  of  the  insanity defense, the  examination of  the  defendant  by state  psychiatrists. The latter provision may  be part and  parcel of  the  requirement of  such  a plea. 5 0

The argument continues that  the  defense  attorneys should be able  to  know  more about  the  state's case.  Further, in  some cases  the  defendant, with natural reluctance, refuses even to tell his  attorneys the  true  facts. After  all, what is  attempted to  be done  in  each  case  is  to  see that justice be done. 51  The discovery,  as admitted, would be a one way  street, because  the constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination and unlawful  search  and seizure, among  others, would  prevent  disclosures  and thus discovery on the  part of  the  defense.

The defense  side  of  the  story is  that there  is  no truth to  the idea  that the  right of discovery on the  part of defense  would

countenance perjury. 5 2  Perjury possibility is probably the strongest argument  on the  side  of  the  prosecution for  preventing  discovery. The fact  remains  that presuming  the  defendant is  truthful to  his  lawyer, with  the  admittedly limited rights of discovery  procedure, the  defense  is  seldom at  a disadvantage in  knowing all  about  the  case.  The actual  practice will  also show that the  defense  attorney who  has  a reputation for  integrity and fairness will  find  the  prosecutor willing to  open his files to  him.  Unfortunately, our  adversary system does not  allow  this  frankness  in criminal  cases,  because unscrupulous attorneys, without  ever  actually ruling out  subordinating perjury (from  a technical, legal  or  more properly  termed "provable"  sense), may  ask their client whether  or  not  he has any defense  to  certain evidence, thus  said  client would be able  to bring  forward  countering and perjured evidence  if  he were given  sufficient time and opportunity. This is  especially true where the  prosecution may be holding  in  abeyance  a rebuttal witness  where it  is probable  that  the  defense  will  come  up with  some story that can  be skillfully "filled with  holes" if  the defense  is  unaware that such  a witness or  such  evidence is  available. Thinking  neutrals" rationally see the  problems  and see the  need for  limitation of  certain discovery matters  as  well  as other possibly hidden  defects in  the  wide open criminal trial. If there could  be  a complete  disclosure of  both  sides in  a  criminal  case,  as in  a civil case,  discovery would  probably  work equally as well, but  it cannot  be seriously advocated  that this come  about. A  solution might come  through  a  compromise whereby the  state must give  all of  its information in  discovery proceedings providing the  accused  first waives  some of  his  constitutional rights which also often prevent the  truth from being known.

VI. TRIAL BY JURY

The right of  trial by  jury is  ingrained in  our  system  of  justice. Although other  countries cannot  understand  that  need,  and it  is  at  times  questionable as a fact  finding body,  we  have not been  willing to  abdicate this constitutional right. Almost everyone for or  against the  jury system  will agree  that its  true value

lies in  the  tempering  of  justice with  mercy. Every state provides  for  a jury  trial in  all felony  cases  with  a few states eliminating the  requirement in  misdemeanor cases." In  certain instances  the  right is not  automatic  without  a demand by the defendant. 55  However,  generally the  right to  be tried by a  jury of  his  peers  can be waived. 5 " This  right to  be tried by a jury does,  in  some instances, blossom  into  a right by the  defendant to waive the same." In other  jurisdictions waiver of a jury

trial must be concurred  in  by  the  judge,  the  prosecutor, or both. 5 8  Again,  a  different rule often applies in  capital cases. 5"

The right of  a  jury  trial in  criminal cases  often  becomes additionally confusing  to those  of other  countries when  they take  into  consideration the  grand  jury. The difference should be noted  that the  grand  jury usually hears  only  one side of  the case  and there is  no instruction by the  court on the  individual case  as to the  law and the  evidence. An  indictment does not require a unanimous vote  of the  members  of the  grand  jury. The trial jury, in  all jurisdictions, is  given  instructions in  the instant case  as  to  the  law and is  picked  carefully by the  attorneys for  that  case.  The  grand  jury  is picked  only as a fair minded body,  more as an arm of the  prosecution rather than a protection for  the  defendant."  Challenges to  the  members of the  grand  jury  can be made  by defendants in  a very  limited

ecutor's additional duty  is  obvious  in  such  cases; not  only  must he present evidence  that the  defendant is guilty, but  also  he must through  all  legal  means give  evidence  of the  nature of the  crime  and other reasons why, how  long  and how  severely, especially in  capital cases,  the  defendant should  be punished. This  can  be  a  hindrance to  the  defense  by clouding some issues and a source  of error for  the  prosecution. Further, the prosecution is  prevented from showing some of the  past  record  of the  defendant before  the  jury, which,  of  course, can be shown to the  judge when  he determines  the sentence."  There are numerous obvious  defects which are disadvantageous to both sides. Allowing  the  jury to  pass  sentence, with  the  possible exception of the  death  penalty which involves more  the  discussion  of  the  pros  and cons  of  capital punishment, is  condemned by all. Yet,  it is  difficult to  change this  antiquated method of determining punishment. True,  the  punishment  of  each  crime is  provided for as  to  minimum  or  maximum sentence by statute, but  these are  often very  broad  and require more deliberation, facts and  understanding than  can  and  are given  to  and  by  a  jury. Some  correction of  abuses  can  be made by the  judge  and there are  also  provisions for  suspending sentences and  placing the  defendant  on probation, 5  but  a decision by a jury  on punishment,  having  been made  by members  of the public  and in whom the  public puts  a  great deal  of  faith, has  probably more weight  than  the  circumstances warrant. It, at  the  least, puts  the judge in  the  position of having  to overcome the prima  facie "correct" punishment.

In most states the  judge  passes  on the  sentence  meted out after the  verdict of  guilty. While only  in  a  few states is  the  prosecutor  by statute °  given duties in connection  with assisting the  judge  to  determine the  sentence, it is  the  usual  procedure to  ask the prosecutor for  his  recommendations.  Such recommendations  are  given  a great deal  of  weight. In  some instances the  prosecutor can almost  guarantee to  a defendant what sentence  he will  receive, especially where he pleads  guilty. This method is  often used to  dispose of  cases  without  trial, by bargaining  between the prosecutor and the defense.  The  pros-

ecutor can  also  regulate the  sentence by charging a person  with a  lesser degree  of  a  felony or  even  reducing it to  a  misdemeanor.

VIII. NEW TRIALS; APPEALS

Provision for  appeal  by the  defendant is  unrestricted for  all practical purposes  in  all  jurisdictions." The procedures  vary, but  the review  by  a  higher court is  fairly well  all-inclusive. New trials can be  granted on the  motion  of  the  defendant. 6 "

As  to  the  authority for  the  state to  appeal  and obtain  new trials there  is an entirely different picture. Connecticut and Vermont,  by statute have given  the  state the  equal  right with the  defendant to  appeal  on questions of  law so that if  the  defendant  is  acquitted the  state can obtain a new  trial and the defendant thus  can  be retried. 9

Several  states allow  the  state an appeal  on errors committed by the  court  for  the purpose  of the  future  guidance  of the trial courts  in handling  similar problems on  procedure  or

law,  but  such  appeals have no effect on the  instant case." 0  Many states allow  limited appeal  in  other areas, basically where the court has  dismissed the  charge  either before  trial or  after conviction or  in  the  change  of  sentence or  preliminary orders  before  trial. 7 " Sometimes the  statute provides  that the  state can cross  appeal  on errors claimed  or excepted  to, where the  de-

STAT.

§§ 9-2304-2305 (1933).

fendant  appeals  the conviction." There are some  states that either do not  provide  for appeal  or  specifically deny the  right to  the  state to  appeal. 3

In  the  area of  the lack  of  the  state's right to  appeal, the  prosecuting  attorney finds  himself  truly frustrated. The criminal law and procedures are  generally developed by appeals by defendants  and the  molding of the law is thus  determined  in those  cases  picked by the  defendants. Some  courts are  inclined to  lean  toward the state on a questionable point  raised  on trial because they know  the defendant  can appeal  if there is  error, and in  other cases  the  trial judge, who  wants  to  have a good record  on appeal, leans  toward the  defense, realizing that  the  state cannot  appeal.  Both situations are deplorable. With the  right to  appeal by the  state limited, the  more imporant  matters  involving trial procedures  become  unquestioned and affect each case  as  well  as future cases. It  has  been clearly decided  that, at  least in  state courts, there  is  no Federal  Con-

stitutional objection of former jeopardy  as it  applies to the state's right to  appeal, 7 but  there  are  still limitations within state constitutions and  statutes.

While the  rights of the  state to  appeal  errors in procedure occurring during  the  trial for  the  purpose  of  future guidance of  courts is  better than  nothing, it  has  a number of  disadvantages  which the  equal  right of appeal  for  both  the  state and defendant would  cure.  Often  such limited "moot rights" of appeal  are couched with the need of approval  of the trial judge, or  the  appellate court, or both. 7 5 In most of  the  statutes provision is  made  for  the  trial judge  to  hire counsel, possibly the  defense  attorney, who  would not  have a direct concern  as it would not  affect the  instant case. 76 The appeals  are  probably limited to  cases  where the  trial court, either by statutory authority or by tacit approval, agrees  with  the  prosecutor that a certain point, i.e., admission  of evidence  needs  clarification. Other  abuses include:  (1) the  defendant's lawyer is not  restrained in  any manner during the  trial of the  case,  but  he is encouraged  to  become  more of an advocate  than  is  necessary; (2) the  prosecutors, who  generally are  not  career men, lose  the incentive to  make  an issue of  a  matter where there is  only  this limited right to  attack procedural rules as  a moot matter;  (3) even  more is  the  fact that this type  of  appeal  is  allowed  in  most states that lack  large metropolitan areas  where the  prosecutors have  more of  a  stake in  the  future procedural rules.

The same argument a fortiori applies to the  more  limited right of  appeal, not  to  mention  in  those  states where no right of  appeal by the  state exists.

IX. CONTROL OF THE  PROSECUTOR's AUTHORITY

The degree  of  control of  the  prosecutor in  administering the duties of  his  office  vary  to some extent, at  least as far  as the statutes indicate. Although  it  probably  can be more  accurate

to  state the  prosecutor is  relatively free  from controls and the statutory provisions are more  or less  illusory, in that  most prosecutors in this  country  are elected  for relatively short terms,  the  consciousness of  election may  have a great deal  of bearing  on the  need for  the  use of the  statutory methods in two ways:  (1)  the  prosecutor is  very  conscious of public opinion, possibly too  much so;78 (2)  those  who have  some semblance of authority to control the  prosecutor also  are  conscious  that he has  been  elected and that neglect of  duty  is  a relative thing which is  difficult to prove and even more  difficult to "clash horns"  over  in  a  battle of  rights and  duties. A prosecuting attorney would have to commit a serious  malfeasance  in  office  to force most  judges or  the  attorney general of  a  state to  move.

Whether by statute or by implied  authority, the  courts  of each  state could  probably  appoint an acting prosecuting attorney because  of  his  absence  in  court  and failure to prosecute a matter, i.e., failure to file  an information after a defendant was bound over  to  court." 9 In  some states the  statutory authority  is  more explicit." 0  In Connecticut, since  the  courts appoint all the  prosecuting officials for  a  term  of  years, the  court could change  the  prosecutor whenever  it so desired. 8 '

The attorney general  of  each  state also  has  varying  powers to take  over the  duties of the prosecuting attorneys. Almost all  states have provisions for  the  attorney general to  take  over the  prosecution of  a criminal case  at  the  order of  the  governor of  the  state, and it  covers  the  gauntlet to  where the  attorney general is, in  fact, the  prosecuting official. 82 Many  statutes provide  that the  attorney general will  conduct  all  appeals  in  the highest appellate court  of  the  state, 83  so that  the  prosecuting

attorney either has no authority in  appeals, whether  made  by the  defendant or  by the  state, or  only  nominal  connection, except  in the case of the more  enlightened attorney general. Some  attorneys general  have been known  to  oppose the  prosecuting attorney's concept  of a case, 8 4  although  it  is obvious the prosecutor who  has tried the case is more  cognizant  of the  problems  and will usually be in  a better position to  advise what should  be done. In addition, the  prosecuting attorney who  does not  have the  responsibility from beginning  to end is  rather handicapped, and  yet  probably bears  the  brunt of  the public indignation if there is  a  failure to  convict.

X. CONCLUSION

In making this survey  and in  reference to the  procedural problems  from the  standpoint of  the  prosecutor there has  been an attempt to  merely  refer to  what are  the  facts and leave  the need for  a change,  if one is  thought needed,  to  the  individual reader's own  belief.

That the criminal law  procedures  and its  administration moves  slowly,  is  uniformly  agreed  upon.  It  is also  generally stated that it does  not  move  with  the  benefit of  any empirical study  or  purpose. Much  change has  come  about  merely  on an emotional  basis where the  matter is  placated by the  passage  of a  law  or  a  decision by a court. The plaudits still are  there, that in  spite of seemingly  insurmountable obstacles we  adapt  various  laws  and  precedents to  fit the  change  in  times, arriving at a rather unimpeachable  administration of  criminal justice. We must criticize the  obvious  injustices whether  to  the  individual or  the  public in  the  administration of  our  criminal laws.  Even more than  that we must  try to  recognize both  sides of  the  question  and by this we will  arrive at  what is  the  best for  all concerned. For this reason  above all, we  need strong spokesmen for  the prosecutor, who  after all  represents the public, and equally strong  spokesmen for  the  defense, who  represent the individuals whose rights as members  of the public  must be protected.

APPENDIX

FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Rule 6(a).  Summoning  Grand Juries. The court  shall order  one or  more grand juries to be summoned at such times as the  public  interest requires. The grand  jury shall consist of not  less  than 16 nor more than 23 members. The court shall direct that a  sufficient number of legally qualified persons  be summoned  to  meet this requirement.

Rule 6(b)(1). Challenges. The  attorney for  the government or a  defendant who  has been held  to  answer in the district court  may  challenge  the array of  jurors on the  ground  that the  grand  jury was not  selected, drawn or  summoned  in  accordance  with  law,  and may  challenge an individual juror on the ground that the  juror is  not  legally qualified. Challenges  shall  be made  before  the  administration of the  oath  to  the  jurors and shall  be tried  by the court.

Rule 6(d). Who May  be Present. Attorneys  for  the  government,  the witness under examination, interpreters when  needed and,  for  the  purpose  of taking the  evidence, a stenographer may  be present while  the  grand  jury  is  in  session,  but  no person other  than  the  jurors may  be present  while the grand jury  is  deliberating or  voting.

Rule 6(f). Finding  and Return  of Indictment. An  indictment may be found only upon the  concurrence of 12  or  more jurors. The indictment shall ,be returned  by the  grand  jury to  a  judge  in  open court.

Rule 6(g) Discharge  and Excuse.  A  grand  jury shall  serve  until discharged by the  court but  no grand  jury may  serve  more than  18 months.  The tenure and powers of  a grand  jury  are  not  affected by the  beginning  or expiration of a term  of  court. At  any  time  for  cause  shown the  court may  excuse  a juror either temporarily or 'permanently, and in  the  latter event  the  court  may  impanel another  person  in  place  of  the  juror excused.

Rule 7(a).  Use  of Indictment  or Information. An offense  which  may be punished  by death  shall be prosecuted 'by indictment. An  offense  which may be punished  by imprisonment  for  a term exceeding  one year  or  at  hard  labor shall  be prosecuted by indictment or,  if  an indictment is  waived,  it may  be prosecuted by information. Any  other offense  may  be prosecuted by indictment or by information. An  information may  be filed without  leave  of court.

Rule 15(a).  Deposition-When  Taken.  If  it appears  that a prospective witness may  be unable  to  attend or prevented from attending a trial or  hearing, that his  testimony is material and that  it is necessary to take  his deposition in order  to  prevent a  failure of  justice, the  court  at  any time  after the  filing of an indictment or  information may  upon motion of a  defendant  and notice  to the parties order  that his testimony be  taken by deposition and that  any designated  books, papers, documents or tangible objects, not privileged, be produced  at  the  same time  and  place. If  a witness is  committed  for  failure to give  bail to  appear  to  testify at  a trial or  hearing, the  court on written motion of the  witness  and upon notice  to  the  parties may  direct that his  deposition be taken. After  the  deposition has 'been  subscribed the  court  may  discharge the  witness.

Rule 16.  Discovery  and Inspection. Upon  motion of  a  defendant at  any time after the  filing of the indictment or information, the  court  may  order  the

attorney for  the  government to  permit  the  defendant to  inspect and copy or photograph  designated books,  papers, documents or  tangible objects, obtained from or  belonging to the  defendant or  obtained  from others by seizure or by process, upon a showing that the  items  sought  may  be material to  the  preparation  of  his  defense  and  that the  request is  reasonable. The order  shall specify the  time, place  and manner of making the  inspection and of  taking the  copies or  photographs and may  prescribe such  terms  and conditions as are  just.

Rule 23(a).  Trial by Jury. Cases required to  be tried by jury  shall be so tried unles  the  defendant waives a jury  trial in  writing with the  approval  of the court  and the  consent of  the  government.

Rule 32(a).  Sentence and Judgment.  Sentence  shall  be imposed without  unreasonable delay.  Pending  sentence  the  court  may  commit  the  defendant  or continue  or alter the bail. Before  imposing sentence  the court  shall  afford the  defendant  an opportunity to  make  a statement in his  own  behalf  and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.

No  less  than  ten  days before  the  date  set  for trial, the  attorney for  the  government may  serve  upon  the  defendant or his attorney a demand  that the  defendant serve  a notice of alibi if  the  defendant intends to  rely  on such defense at  the  trial.
