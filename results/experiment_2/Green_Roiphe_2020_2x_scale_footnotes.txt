We  would  like  to  thank  Alvin  Bragg,  Doni  Gewirtzman, and  Justin  Murray  for  their thoughtful  comments on  an earlier draft.  The  article  also  benefited  from the  discussion  and papers presented  at  the  symposium, "21st  Century  Prosecution: Legal, Empirical, and Theoretical  Perspectives,"  held at the Northwestern Pritzker  School of Law. Particular thanks to  Chad Flanders and Joshua Kleinfeld for their detailed  and provocative  commentary.

2 Bruce  Green  & Ellen Yaroshefsky, Prosecutorial Accountability 2.0, 92 NOTRE DAME L.  REV. 51, 87-93, 100-07  (2016)  (describing  how  public  and  regulatory  efforts  to  hold prosecutors  accountable  for misconduct  and abuse  have been fueled by,  among other things, "public  disenchantment  with the  criminal  process,"  reform  coalitions  and  movements,  and information  technology).

3 See,  e.g., Rachel  E.  Barkow, Three Lessons  for Criminal  Law Reformers  from Locking Up Our Own,  107 CALIF. L. REV.  1967, 1969-70 (2019) (contrasting progressive  prosecutors with "traditional 'tough-on-crime' prosecutors).

4  Obviously, criminal justice  reform  has  been  important at many,  if  not  all,  points  in American  history.  We  are  simply  suggesting that the  two  reform  movements are  worth comparing  because  they  involve  a  unique  common  feature.  For a discussion  of  the  use  of history in  legal  scholarship,  see Mark Tushnet, Interdisciplinary Legal  Scholarship:  The Case of History-in-Law,  71 CHI.-.  KENT L.  REV. 909  (1996). Tushnet argues that  history is  a form of  storytelling. Id. at  914-17. The  story we tell  in  this article is  not  one of  decline or progressive victory. It  is  rather a  story  of  oscillation,  consistency about  some  things  and extreme  swings  in  sentiment about  others.  A  lesson  we  draw  from  this story is  that as  we embrace  change,  it might be useful to  moderate the nature of change with some  useful lessons of the past.

17 The  efficiency  movement  argued  that  the  economy,  society,  and  government  were riddled with inefficiency.  Proponents  like Frederick Winslow Taylor proposed to bring expert management to bear on these problems to reduce waste. The movement favored administrative  and executive  expertise  over popular participation or control  and assumed that proper  management  would  not  only  reduce  waste  but  also  eliminate  most  conflict.

58 Before being elected District Attorney,  Jerome also  cut corners  as a judge.  As  an anticormption crusader,  trailed by reporters,  he  would enter brothels  and gambling clubs, holding trials  and  cross-examining  witnesses  on  the  spot  without  regard  to  rules  of  evidence  and procedures. Id. at  69-71. The  pursuit of professionalism  did not always  live up to  its own aspirations,  in part because  its proponents,  like Jerome,  depended on popular  support.

While  the  Progressive  Era  was  diverse  and  there  was  no  one  political  or social  agenda, the  movement  shared  certain  themes,  one  of which  was  anti-monopolism, which could take the  form of a populist rage  against concentration of wealth and power.

150 For  example, Manhattan  prosecutor  Cyrus  Vance, Jr.,  undertook  initiatives  later associated  with progressive  prosecution,  such as  creating a  conviction  integrity unit; ending the  prosecution  of  violations, infractions,  and  certain misdemeanors  where  the  individual poses  no  risk to public  safety;  and  pursuing alternatives  to  incarceration. See MANHATTAN DIST.

151 For  instance, Cyrus  Vance,  Jr.,  the  District  Attorney  of  New  York  County,  was described  in 2017  as  "considered one  of  America's  most  progressive  prosecutors."

Nevertheless, as  of June 2020,  a year before the next election  and before  Vance  had announced whether he would  step  down,  he faced  five progressive  challengers  for the Democratic  party  nomination.

MILLER,  PROSECUTION:  THE DECISION TO CHARGE A  SUSPECT WITH A CRIME 253-59  (1970)  (discussing the  decision not to  charge  because  of the  suspect's willingness  to cooperate); id. at  159  ("[T]here  is  general  recognition  everywhere  that  resources  are  simply not  adequate  to  fully  enforce  every  penal  law.  Recognition  of the  necessity  for  charging discretion,  therefore,  is most widespread  in terms of limited resources.").

193 Id. at 186  ("Obviously guilty persons may  not  be  charged when,  in  the judgment  of the police  or prosecutor, the  consequences  of prosecution and conviction  seem unduly harmful in relation  to  the  criminal  conduct  involved  or the  social  and  economic  circumstances  of the suspect."). In  cases  involving low-level  offenders, state  and  federal  prosecutors have employed  formal  and  informal diversion  programs, in  which  charges are  deferred  and ultimately  declined or dismissed upon satisfaction of conditions  such as payment of restitution or refraining  from further criminal conduct. See United States v.  Flowers,  983 F.  Supp.  159, 161-65  (E.D.N.Y.  1997) (describing  the history and use  of deferred prosecution).

196 Following  Rachael  Rollins's  election as  Boston  prosecutor, the  National Police Association  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Massachusetts  disciplinary  authority, alleging  that Rollins's campaign promise not to charge certain crimes reflected  a "reckless  disregard of the laws."

204  ROLLINS, supra note  196,  at app.  C-1.  As historians  of  Progressive  Era criminal  justice reform would  argue, however, the substitution  of  private voluntary organizations for government punishment involves a shift in policing rather than an elimination of social control entirely. See WILLRICH, supra note  21, at xxi-xxxix.

207 See,  e.g., State  v.  Winne,  96  A.2d  63  78-79  (1953)  (upholding  indictment  of local prosecutor  for  nonfeasance for  failing  to  prosecute individuals for  operating  gambling establishments).

211 While  it  is  impossible  to  know  why  some  would-be  progressive  prosecutors  were defeated  at the  polls, the  answer may be,  in part,  that voters regarded their proposed  policies as unwise.

214  Much has been written about holistic, or comprehensive, criminal defense representation. See,  e.g., James M. Anderson, Maya Buenaventura & Paul Heaton, The Effects ofHolistic  Defense on Criminal  Justice Outcomes, 132 HARv. L. REv.  819,  819 (2019).  There is  no  comparable  literature  about  holistic  approaches  to prosecution,  although references  are occasionally  made to the  concept.

215 Bruce  Green, Urban Policing and  Public  Policy The Prosecutor's Role, 51  GA.  L. REv.  1179,  1188-89  (2017) ("The principal objective  of a prosecutor's office  'is to  ensure the efficient  and effective  prosecution  or disposition of cases  presented for the prosecution,' and some offices may  view this as the limit  of their responsibilities.")  (citation omitted).

216 Bellin raises  issues with this  approach,  arguing that  prosecutors  should  prosecute  or dismiss  cases,  but not create diversion programs. See Bellin, supra note  118,  at  1239-40.

217 See generally WILLRICH, supra note  21  (arguing that the  advent  of the welfare  state was  rooted in  the Progressive  Era concept of criminality, which justified a greater intrusion  of the  government in the lives  of immigrants  and the poor).

REV. 285, 291-92  (2012)  ("Community prosecutors  typically  work  with members  of the  community  to  identify  recurring,  ongoing criminal  justice  problems  (drug dealing, graffiti,  vagrancy)  and  then  work  in tandem  with community  representatives  and  agencies  to address  these  problems through a project,  policy, or strategy, often involving nontraditional  methods."); see also Green, supra note 215,  at 1196 ("[W]here  vagrancy  is  the  result  of poverty  or  homelessness,  a  prosecutor  must  determine whether  the  state  should  respond  through  criminal  prosecutions  or  whether  social  welfare programs that  address the  underlying causes will better serve  societal  ends.").

224 On this point, we disagree with a forthcoming article arguing that local popular support itself  confers  democratic  legitimacy  on progressive  prosecutors' policies  of lenity. See  W.
