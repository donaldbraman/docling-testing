1. In 2004, Canadian  scholar  David  Beatty asserted  that proportionality  review  was  the  "ultimate"  rule of law  for  resolving constitutional  questions  about rights;  as  a positive  matter, it was  the  dominant method  of constitutional  interpretation  in  the world,  and as a normative matter,  it  was  superior to  such  other methods  as  originalism or  textualism. DAVID M. BEATTY, THE ULTIMATE RULE  OF LAW 159-88 (2004). In 2005, U.S. legal  scholar David Law  identified  proportionality  as  a  "generic"  component  of constitutional  adjudication  around  the world.  David S.  Law, Generic Constitutional  Law, 89 MINN. L. REV. 652  (2005). On  the  role of  proportionality in  international  law and  administrative law, see, for  example,  HCJ 2056/04 Beit Sourik Vill.

A  significant feature  of such a formulation  is  the apparent  absence  of any  prioritization  of the underlying  right  to  a  fair  hearing;  the Mathews test  suggests  a  kind  of quantifiable  cost-benefit inquiry,  without  giving  clear  weight  to  the  basic procedural  values  of fair  hearings  for  those  singled  out  for adverse  government treatment.

92. Quebec (Att'y Gen.) v.  A., [2013]  1 S.C.R.  ยถ 442; see supra note  87. Quebec (Attorney General) v.  A. involved a  Charter challenge to  Quebec's failure to treat de facto  marriages  as  carrying the full  range  of  property  rights  and  support  on termination  as  did formalized  marriages  or civil unions.  Four justices  found no violation  of Charter equality rights;  five justices  found a violation  of Section  15  equality  rights.  However,  Chief Justice  McLachlin  (one  of the  five) concluded  that the statute  could  nonetheless  be salvaged under  Section 1. For Chief Justice McLachlin,  the goal  of  the  Quebec scheme was  "choice  and autonomy  for all Quebec  spouses  ... to  structure their  relationship  outside  ... the mandatory regime applicable  to married and civil  union spouses," [2013] 1 S.C.R.  '  435 (McLachlin,  C.J.),  supported by considerations  of federalism, id. 1q  439-49; see  id.  ยถ 447  (describing  Quebec  as  seeking  to  "maximiz[e]"  autonomy and choice).  Three other justices who found a Section  15  violation would have  upheld all  but the  support  provisions  under Section 1. Justice Abella,  who alone  found none of the  equality violations  to  be justified  under Section 1, disagreed with the Chief Justice  as  to  minimal  impairment  and  proportionality  as  such, see id. ยถ5 358-80 (Abella,  J., dissenting) (arguing  that  an  "opt  out"  approach, with  presumptive  application  of the  same rules  to  de  facto  as  to  formal  marriage,  was  less  impairing  because  it  would  better  protect the  economically  vulnerable  partner  and would  equally  advance  the purpose).  Their  disagreement  may illustrate  the significance  of  how the government's purpose  is articulated.  For Justice Abella,  the  goal was  simply "freedom  of choice," id. 9 358, a  goal that  could be served as  well,  with less  harm to  the  economically  weaker partner, by  the  opt-out approach, id. ยถ 377-79. On the  risks of accepting  "maximization"  as part of  a government  goal, see  Alberta v. Hutterian  Brethren of  Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009]  2 S.C.R. 567, 5q 147,  149 (Abella, J.,  dissenting);  and id. 5  195  (LeBel,  J.,  dissenting).  These  disagreements  might  be  understood as  about defining the  government purpose,  or as  about what a "reasonable  alternative" is  for  minimal impairment  purposes.

130. This "negative-only"  view of the  rights protected has  not always  been clearly  dominant. See, e.g., Archibald Cox, The Supreme Court, 1965 Term -Foreword:  Constitutional Adjudication and the Promotion  of Human Rights, 80 HARv.  L.  REv. 91 (1966) (arguing  that a theme  of recent cases has  been the need  for affirmative action,  in contrast with  prior practice,  to  advance  the goal of equality); Frank I. Michelman, The Supreme Court, 1968 Term-Foreword:  On Protecting the  Poor through the Fourteenth  Amendment, 83  HARv. L. REv.  7 (1969) (arguing  that  recent  decisions  should be  understood  as  reflecting  a  duty to  secure  minimum  levels  of welfare).

131. It is perhaps  not a  coincidence  that Justice  Breyer,  in some cases  in which  he  has argued  for some  form of proportionality  review  of statutes,  has  also seen  in  those  cases  First Amendment interests  on both  sides. See,  e g., Nixon  v.  Shrink  Mo.  Gov't PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 400 (2000) (Breyer,  J.,  concurring)  ("[C]onstitutionally  protected  interests  lie  on  both sides  of the  legal  equation..  . .").

132. In the  United  States,  even "compelling  interests" sufficient  to  overcome  presumptive  rights protections  are  optional,  in  the  sense  that  governments  may  choose  whether  or  not  to  advance them;  in Germany,  by contrast,  the  Basic Law  is understood  to  impose some  affirmative duties  on government.

135. See,  e.g., cases  cited supra note 38.

136. This approach  is often associated with  the idea that rights act  like "trumps" over other interests  against  government  action. See DwORKIN, supra note 34,  at  xi  (calling  rights  "political trumps  held by individuals");  Ronald  Dworkin, Rights as Trumps, in THEORIES OF  RIGHTS 153, 166  (Jeremy Waldron ed., 1984) (describing  rights  as  "trumps  over  some background justification for  political  decisions  that  states  a goal  for  the  community  as  a whole"  and  arguing  that rights  are needed  "only when  some  decision  that injures  some people  nevertheless finds prima-facie  support  in the claim that it will  make the community  as a whole better off');  see also Gregoire  Webber, On the Loss of  Rights, in PROPORTIONALITY AND  THE RuLE OF LAw:  RIGHTS, JUSTIFICATION, REASONING  123 (Grant  Huscroft et al.  eds., 2014). But cf Fallon, supra note  6,  at 1316-17 (distinguishing  "triggering  rights," which  prompt  strict scrutiny,  from  "ultimate" rights);  Gardbaum, supra note  5,  at 423-25 (noting  instances  where  the U.S.  Supreme  Court has identified a "two-step  analysis" of rights' infringement  and of  justifications  for limits).  Gardbaum  suggests  that without a  textual  limitations  clause,  "[w]here all  limits  are  judicially  implied,  it is  far  easier  to  justify  such  implication  if all  limits  are thought of as part of  the first step, part  of  the  undoubtedly  legitimate judicial function  of  in-

See,  e.g., Gratz  v.  Bollinger,  539  U.S.  244, 275 (2003) (asking  what  the Fourteenth Amendment forbids  and  finding that "because  the  University's use  of race  in its  current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly  tailored to achieve  respondents' asserted compelling interest in  diversity,  the  admissions policy violates  the Equal  Protection Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment").  In Canada,  by contrast,  the Court first asks  whether  the  interests  advanced by the challenger are protected  by the substantive Charter provision relied  on before  analyzing  the  government's justifications  for  its  action  (although  there  is  debate  over  the  role  of particular  considerations  in  the  Section  15  equality  analysis  as  compared  with the  Section  1 justification  analysis).

194. See  id.  ยถ 30. Aucoin challenged  the lawfulness  of the pat-down  search,  which  in this factual context,  turned  on whether  under Section  9  of the  Canadian  Charter,  "securing  the appellant in the cruiser . . . was reasonably  necessary";  the Court  found that it was  not,  and thus there was no authority  for the pat-down search. Id.  ยถยถ 30,  44; see infra note 201. The issue  in the  case  was  the  reasonableness  of the  officer's  actions, not  whether  a  statute found  to infringe  a  Charter right  could  be "salvaged"  by  a Section 1  proportionality analysis; the Court's application  of the reasonable  necessity  requirement  for detentions  under Section  9 incorporates  concern for the proportionality  of police  actions. See Aucoin, [2012]  3 S.C.R.  ยถ 44;  R.  v. Clayton, 2007 SCC 32,  [2007]  2 S.C.R. 725, ยถ 21 (Can.).

It added that "a different  factual  matrix may  well have supported a finding of reasonable necessity," id. ยถ43,  consistent with  Canadian  case  law's emphasis  that the question whether a detention  is  "reasonably  necessary"  is a highly contextual  one. See Clayton, [2007]  2 S.C.R. 5 31 (explaining  the  need  to consider "the  nature  of the situation,  including  the seriousness of the  offence, . . . information  known to the  police about the  suspect or  the crime,  and the extent  to which  the detention  was reasonably  responsive or tailored to  these  circumstances," in order to "balanc[e]  the seriousness  of the risk to public or individual  safety with the liberty interests  of  members  of the public to  determine whether,  given the extent  of the risk, the nature  of the  stop  is  no  more intrusive  of liberty  interests  than  is  reasonably  necessary  to address  the risk").

But see  Entm't Merchs., 131  S.  Ct.  at  2766 (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting)  (indicating  that in applying  strict scrutiny,  he  "would evaluate  the degree  to  which  the  statute injures speech-related  interests,  the  nature of  the potentiallyjustifying  'compelling  interests,'  the degree  to  which  the statute  furthers that interest,  the nature and effectiveness of  possible  alternatives,  and,  in light  of this  evaluation,  whether, overall,  'the statute works  speech-related harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits  that the statute seeks  to provide"' (quoting United States  v.

For critique  of  political  process  theory  as the basis  for judicial  review  as  "radically  indeterminate  and fundamentally  incomplete,"  see Tribe, supra note 241,  at 1064. Such  objections do not,  in my view,  apply to  considering  the disproportionate effects  of laws  as  a  signal  of the kind of possible  process  failure  that  may  conflict with  more substantive  constitutional  commitments.

264. Justice  Stevens  has  articulated  a "duty  to  govern  impartially"  in  several  opinions. See,  e.g., Vieth v.  Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267,  341  (2004) (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting);  Harris  v.  McRae,  448 U.S. 297, 357 (1980) (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting); see also Jeremy Waldron, Principles  of  Legislation,  in THE LEAST  EXAMINED  BRANCH, supra note 30, at 21 (discussing  the  importance  of impartiality and justice  in legislation).

ter Justice  Marshall and  served  as  his law  clerk  in October  Term 1977, my  appreciation  for his views came most fully into focus after I had studied comparative constitutional  law.

See,  e.g., WEBBER, supra note 235, at 89-115; Stavros Tsakyrakis, Proportionality: An Assault on Human Rights?, 7 INT'L  J.  CONST.  L. 468,  470-72 (2009).

"an  unmanageable  multiplicity  of  rules"  that cannot be  humanly  remembered,  that present numerous  choices  regarding  which  rule  is  applicable,  and  whose  artificiality  begets  more rules  that "muddy  more than  they clarify"  and depart from both justice and predictability.

For a complex taxonomy of balancing,  see MOLLER, supra note 29, at 137-73.

293. See Aleinikoff, supra note 15,  at  998-99  (arguing that constitutional  cases  involving  competing interests can be "resolved.  . . by a principle" not  derived from balancing).

297. See,  e.g., R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [19851 S.C.R. 295 (Can.)  (invalidating  a statute found to  have  an  illegitimate  purpose  (coercing religious observance),  with  no  further  Section  1 analysis); see  also cases cited supra note 82.

298. See Perju, supra note 228, at 352 (arguing that inquiry  into government purpose  at the  outset of  proportionality analysis offers a theoretical possibility  of  deontological constraint). Deontological inquiry may also be required to determine the nature  of the right and severity of its  infringement. See BARAK, supra note 22, at 45-51 (describing  how  the  right's scope  is determined by  interpreting  constitutional  text,  and noting  distinction  between  "core"  and "penumbra"  of  right); see  also  supra notes 295-296; cf Perju, supra note 228, at  354 (discussing  the  "core"  and "periphery"  of rights). Perju  argues that  in practice  the potential of purpose  inquiries to  impose  constraints  has  not been  realized. Id. at 352-53. But see supra notes 82,  297 (discussing  Canadian cases finding insufficient  purpose). Determining what is a sufficient purpose  to warrant  an infringement  on rights  is itself connected  to  a conceptual understanding  of the right  and its  purpose.  Cf BARAK, supra note 22, at  248  (arguing  that purposes  sufficient to justify intrusion on rights  "may vary  ... from  one  right to another"). Some  critics argue that proportionality review, coupled with limitations clauses that expressly  acknowledge  that rights  may  be limited with  sufficient justification,  will  diminish rights protection as a  whole. See, e.g., Rao, supra note 126, at 227-37. Whether proportionality  review would have  this  effect is likely to be  highly context dependent.  In the context  of categorical  rules  that,  as  in Atwater, or Florence, arguably  under-protect  rights, proportionality  review would likely advance rights protection.

It  could  be  argued,  however,  that the  "balancing" approach  adopted by the Court was also rights-undermining,  insofar as it facilitated rejecting  the  position,  argued  by Justice  Scalia,  that  for a  citizen,  detention  and trial  had to be  by ordinary  criminal  process,  with  speedy  trial  rights  and  the  full  panoply  of criminal procedure  rights, see  id. at 572 (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting),  a position  the  plurality rejected, id. at 522-24 (plurality opinion).

317. Cohen-Eliya  and Porat  do  recognize exceptions  to  their generalization,  in  the  possibility  of exceptions  to  bans  on  race  discrimination  to  "avoid  drastic  outcomes,"  or  in the  "clear  and present"  danger  tests  for  free  speech  in the  early  twentieth  century,  bodies  of law  they describe  as  a "consequentialist  constraint"  on an  otherwise  intent-based deontological  system. See COHEN-ELIYA & PORAT,  PROPORTIONALITY, supra note 3,  at 71-72.

318. See,  e.g., Pike v.  Bruce  Church,  Inc., 397 U.S. 137,  142  (1970). Cohen-Eliya  and Porat recognize the dormant commerce  clause as another exception  to their generalization  about intent. See  infra note  395.

See,  e.g., Turner  Broad.  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 661-63 (1994). Thus,  even  when there  is  no intent to regulate  speech  on account of its content,  some heightened  scrutiny  still applies.

Government conduct  that  "deliberately"  elicits  incriminating  statements  from  a  suspect  in the  absence  of counsel  is  forbidden. See Kuhlmann  v.  Wilson,  477  U.S.  436,  459 (1986); Massiah v.  United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206  (1964).

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1,  109  (1973), arguing that because "discrimination  against important  individual  interests  with  constitutional implications  and  against particularly  disadvantaged or powerless  classes  is involved,"  the Court should have more carefully scrutinized Texas's scheme  relying  on  local  property  taxes  to  fund  the free  public  education  the  State guaranteed  its citizens.

Davis, 426 U.S.  at 246 ("Even agreeing  with the District Court that the differential  racial effect of Test 21 called  for  further inquiry, we  think the  District  Court correctly held  that the affirmative  efforts  of  the  Metropolitan Police  Department  to  recruit  black officers, the changing racial  composition of  the recruit classes  and of the force in general . . . and the  relationship of the test  to the training program negated  any  inference  that the Department  discriminated on the basis of  race  or that 'a police  officer qualifies  on the color of  his  skin rather than ability."'

"[i]f the  penalty were  unreasonably  severe  for a  single  offense,  the constitutional  question might be urged"  if the Eighth  Amendment  had been  assigned  as  error  and were  applicable to  the  government  involved); id. at 339-40 (Field,  J., dissenting) ("The  inhibition  is  directed,  not  only  against  punishments  of the  character  mentioned,  but  against  all  punishments which by  their excessive  length or  severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.  The whole  inhibition  is against  that which  is  excessive  either  in  the bail  required, or  fine imposed,  or punishment  inflicted."); cf Pervear  v.  Massachusetts, 72 U.S.  (5  Wall.) 475, 480  (1867) (noting that the Eighth Amendment does  not apply  to the  states, but going on  to say  in any  event  that  "it appears  from  the  record  that  the  fine and  punishment  in the case before  us was fifty dollars  and imprisonment  at hard labor in  the house  of  correction  for three months.  We perceive nothing excessive,  or cruel,  or  unusual in this").

See Graham  v.  Florida, 560 U.S.  48,  99 (2010) (Thomas,  J., joined by  Scalia, J.,  dissenting); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S.  349, 382-413  (1910) (White, J.,  joined  by Holmes,  J.,  dissenting).

See Note, supra note 424, at  967 & n.121  (noting the role of appellate  review in constraining sentencing decisions  in England and Germany).

See,  e.g., SULLIVAN  & FRASE, supra note 52, at 129-68. For  an argument  that proportionality should play more of  a role  in limiting punishment,  regardless  of the penological purposes of punishment,  see Ristroph, supra note  66.

436. See, e.g., Rummel v.  Estelle, 445 U.S.  263, 275-76 (1980); Note, supra note 424, at 960-61 (describing  the concerns  of some  federal appellate judges). William  Stuntz raised  the  possibility  of "a  proportionality  rule,  requiring  that  the conduct  criminalized  be  serious  enough to justify  the punishment  attached to it," but concluded that a major difficulty would be the absence  of a  "nonarbitrary  way  to  arrive  at  the proper  legal  rules,"  whether  for  reviewing sentences,  or distinguishing traffic  stops from other  crimes  for Fourth Amendment  purposes.  Stuntz, supra note 232, at 66,  73.  Comparisons  with other  sentences  for  similar offenses and  offenders  is  an objective  way  of ensuring one kind  of proportionality;  and while  some comparative  severity judgments may  be  contested,  others  are widely  accepted: intentional violence,  for example,  is  generally  considered  more  severe  than  modest property crime.  Appellate  review  of  criminal sentences in other jurisdiction rebuts claims  of necessary  arbitrariness. See supra notes 431-434

 This  point has  been  noted by members  of the Court. See,  e.g., Ewing v. California,  538  U.S. u, 47-52  (2003) (Breyer, J.,  dissenting);  Harmelin v.  Michigan,  5o1 U.S. 957, 1019-20  (1991) (White, J.,  dissenting).

New  Hampshire,  315 U.S.  568, 574 (1942) (describing  the statute for "punishing verbal  acts" that it was  upholding  as  "carefully drawn so  as  not unduly to  impair liberty of expression,"  and concluding  that its application  to  the  facts  did not "substantially or unreasonably imping[e]  upon the privilege  of free speech").

450.  [1990] 3  S.C.R.  697  (Can.).  All of the justices  agreed  that the statute  infringed  on Section 2 protections  of freedom  of expression;  they  disagreed  on  whether,  under  Section  1  of the Charter,  the statute  was "demonstrably justified"  under the Oakes proportionality  test.

451. Id. at 718, 758  (majority opinion); id. at 851-63 (McLachlin,  J.,  dissenting).  Later Canadian case  law  distinguishes  between  exposing  groups  to hatred  and  exposing them  to  ridicule, permitting sanctioning  of  the former but not the  latter. See Sask.  Human Rights  Comm'n v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11,  [2013]  1 S.C.R. 467 (Can.).

all to play would take considerable  reflection. See Jackson, supra note 225, at 843-47 (discussing proportionality  and structural  constitutional  issues).  For  these  reasons,  this paper  has focused primarily on proportionality doctrine in  the adjudication  of individual rights  cases.
