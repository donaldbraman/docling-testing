to the handling  of felonies  as distinguished from  misdemeanors. Prosecuting attorneys include  all  those  persons  having  like  capacity regardless of title.

1 In Kentucky and Utah the County Attorney  conducts  the  preliminary hearings  in felony  cases  and the  District Attorney  prosecutes when  it  reaches the  trial court. Ky. REV. STAT. § 69.210 (1962); UTAH CODE ANN. §  17-18-1 (1953). In other  states there  are County Attorneys  who  handle preliminary hearings, but  they  are under  the control of the District Attorney. There are other  instances where the  prosecuting attorney does not  attend the  preliminary hearing, but such instances are  limited, even though the statute may  not  require  his  presence.

2Some  form of  preliminary examination is  provided  for  in  all  states. Rep-

resentative statutes include:

ALA. CODE tit. 15, §  128  (1958). ALA. CODE tit. 15, §  168  (1958). Specifically provides  no preliminary hearing  necessary  if  arrest occurs  after the indictment.

COLO. REV. STAT. ANN. § 39-5-1 (1953). Preliminary hearing  required  before  filing information, unless waived or by leave  of court.

DEL. R. 5. Preliminary hearing  necessary  to file  information, see State  v. Barr, 23  Del.  340,  79 A. 730 (1909).

IDAHO CODE ANN. §§  19-514,  19-801  (1947);  19-1308 states that informations require preliminary hearings  and no preliminary hearings  to  be held on indictment by  grand  jury. See also IDAHO CONST. art. 1  § 8; In re Winn, 128 Idaho  461, 154 Pac.  497 (1916). Ky. R. CRIM. P.  3.02,  3.04,  3.08, 3.10.

LA. REV. STAT. § 15:154 (1950). Preliminary hearings on  demand  except discretionary with  district judge  after arrest on indictment.

MINN. STAT. § 628.31 (1961). Preliminary hearing  required before  filing of information, unless  waived.

Mo.  REV. STAT. § 544.250 (1959); Mo.  Sup. Or.  R. 23.02. Provides  requirement  of preliminary examination before  filing information. See State v. Green, 305  S.W.2d  863 (Mo. 1957). No  preliminary examination  if  indictment or  if  information is  substituted for  indictment on amendment, if  there is  no substantial change in  allegation.

MONT. REv. CODE ANN. §§  94-4909,  -4915  (1947).  Preliminary examination or  waiver  required before  trial on information, but none if  indictment.

OKLA. STAT.  tit. 22, §§  171, 258 (1961).  OKLA. CONST. art. 2, § 17. Preliminary  hearings or  waiver  thereof required before  filing information.

N.D. CENT. CODE § 29-09-02 (1960). Preliminary examination  required or waiver  thereof before  information may  be filed.

S.D.  CODE §§ 34.1402-.1404, -. 1502 (1939). No  information  filed  without  preliminary examination.

VA. CODE ANN. § 19.1-163.1 (1950). This is  the  exception, that defendant is  entitled to  a  preliminary hearing even though charged by an indictment. Wis. STAT. §§ 954.04, 955.18 (1959).  Preliminary  hearing  required  in misdemeanor cases  in cities over 500,000 (Milwaukee),  where  the county court does not  have jurisdiction, and in  all felony  cases  before  filing of information.

Wyo. STAT.  ANN. § 7-124 (1957). Preliminary hearing required or  its waiver before  information can be filed.

3 Id. See specific statutes: Delaware, Idaho,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  Montana, North  Dakota,  Oklahoma, South Dakota,  Wisconsin  and Wyoming. Contra: Arkansas  provides  for  a  preliminary hearing  but it  is  not  prerequisite to filing an information. See Payne v.  State, 226 Ark. 910,  295 S.W.2d  312 (1956). Note Virginia  and Louisiana, in so far  as indictment is  concerned  and  the  requirement  of a preliminary hearing.

4 Supra note 1.

5Generally  misdemeanors  require preliminary hearings only  where a court that handles  preliminary hearings does not  have jurisdiction to  try  the  offense. See Wisconsin  under  note  2  in  regard  to cities over 500,000 (Milwaukee).

6aThe case of Gideon v.  Wainwright, 372  U.S.  335 (1963) and  related cases  may  well  make  the  question of appointment  of counsel  for  indigent defendants moot,  and counsel will  be  appointed in all criminal cases.

6Supra note  2.  It  is  interesting to  note  the  State of  Virginia  requires a preliminary hearing  and indictment.

7 A  typical standard: Mo. Sup. CT. R. 23.08: "If upon examination  of  the whole matter  the  magistrate shall determine  that no felony  has  been committed by any person, or  that there is  no  probable cause  for charging  the  accused  thereof he shall discharge such accused. .. ."

the matter upon  the

8 Other than  possible disciplinary measures,  there  is  nothing  requiring prosecutor to be diligent in the  preliminary hearing, and as a practical the  magistrate, who  often  is  not  an  attorney, -places great  reliance prosecutor for  advice.

9 Since  the  statutes require some  evidence  to  be presented  that would  at least show  "probable cause"  that a felony  was committed and that the  defendant  committed  it, the  prosecutor, his  assistant or  some  attorney with authority would seem to  be required. However, the  statutes are silent, except  in certain instances where it  is  stated that  the  magistrate must give notice  and can require  the prosecuting attorney to attend  the preliminary hearing. E.g., supposedly  a police officer could  testify before  the  magistrate without  the  prosecuting attorney present  and give sufficient evidence  to  have a  defendant  bound over.  This  is contemplated  in some  of the statutes. Ordinarily, however, the prosecutor will  want to  know  what is  going on if  he is going to be required to  prosecute the  case. E.g., OHIo  REV.  CODE § 2937.06 (Baldwin 1958). Prosecuting  Attorney  may  appear  before  the  court  for  a  preliminary hearing  in  any case  of felony. Some  statutes provide  specifically that the  prosecuting attorney must be present at  preliminary hearings, e.g., NEV.  REV.  STAT.  § 173. 170  (1961).

10 CAL. PENAL CODE § 1385.

COLO. REV. STAT. ANN.  § 39-4-7, -8 (1953).  The District Attorney  must file reasons  why  he does not file an  information after inspection of the preliminary hearing  record  and the  judge  may  require prosecution.

IOWA CODE § 769.10  (1962).  A  private prosecutor could  file  an information. KAN. GEN. STAT. ANN. §§ 62-804,  -807 (1949).  The County Attorney  must check preliminary examination  to  see if  information should  be filed  and if he  deems it  should  not  be filed, he must give  reasons in  writing. The District Judge may  compel prosecution of a  crime by  the  County Attorney  and *  enforce  it through  attachment, fine  or  imprisonment. However, the  case  of Foley v.  Ham,  102  Kan. 66, 169  Pac. 183 (1917)  illustrates the practical * aspects vs.  the  statutory requirements showing that the County Attorney has  more control than  the  statute would indicate.

MicH. STAT. ANN. § 28.981. Prosecuting Attorney  must give a reason to the  court why  an information is  not  filed.

MONT. REV. CODE § 94-6206 (1947). If  the  County Attorney  does not be-, lieve an  information should  be  filed he must give  reasons and the  court must approve. The Court can require prosecution, if  it is  not  satisfied with  the reasons.

NEV.  REV. STAT. § 173.150 (1961).  Court  can compel the  District Attorney to  prosecute a crime  in an extreme case,  enforcing  same by fine,  attachment or  imprisonment.

N.D. CENT. CODE § 29-09-07  (1960).  State's Attorney  must present to  court in  writing, reasons why  no information is  filed  after a preliminary hearing and the  court  must approve.

OKLA. STAT. § 815  (1961).

S.D. CODE § 34.1540 (1939).  State's Attorney  to  determine  if  an information  is  to  be filed and if  not  to  give  statement in  writing to  be  concurred  in by court. If  court does  not  agree,  it can require filing of  information.

UTAH CODE § 77-17-1,  4  (1953). If  District Attorney  fails to file information  after defendant  is  held  on a complaint, he is  guilty of contempt  and may  be prosecuted for  neglect of  duty. Court  can order  District Attorney to file  an information.

VT. STAT. ANN.  tit. 13, § 5654  (1958). Provides  that State's Attorney  can notify judge  or  clerk  that he  will not  file information and defendant will  be discharged  from custody.

WASH. REV. CODE §§  10.16.110,  .20 (1951). If information is not filed Prosecuting Attorney  must give  reasons in  writing and if  court is  not  satisfied  may  direct Prosecuting Attorney  to  file information.

Il The  true noile prosequi is allowed  by statute in the  following states: DEL. R.  48. It  is  interesting to  note  that there was a readoption of  an unlimited  right of nolle prosequi, after a  prior  rule  had required court  approval.

Mo.  REV. STAT. § 558.170 (1959). Provides  for  punishment  of prosecuting attorney if nolle prosequi in  pursuance of  corrupt agreement. Cases construe unlimited right in  prosecuting attorney, subject to  possible showing of  malfeasance in  office. See Dalton  v.  Moody, 325 S.W.2d 21  (Mo.  1959).

In  some  other  states there  are  no statutory provisions expressly restricting right of noile prosequi.

12 Most of  the  states not  listed in  note 11 have restrictions on nolle prosequi

or  its equivalent.

"4Like  all  human  beings  unless  the  information is defective on  its  face, the  judge  does not  like  to  take  the  full  responsibility and would usually  place the  responsibility on the  prosecuting attorney, where it  more properly lies.

is Several  statutes so provide: E.g., IowA  CODE §  769.8 (1962);  MONT. REv. CODE ANN. § 94-9505 (1947). Although a  number of statutes provide  for  dismissal  on motion of  prosecuting attorney and on approval of court: E.g., IND. ANN. STAT. § 9-910 (1932).

15 Most  states have statutes which provide  that  a judge may  appoint  a temporary  prosecuting attorney, if  the official prosecutor is absent, disabled, sick  or in any way  incapacitated or unable  to  attend  court. E.g., GA. CODE §  24-2913 (1933), which provides  for  an appointment  under  like  conditions or judge  may  request the Governor for  the  Attorney  General.  Other courts have held  that authority to  appoint a prosecuting attorney for  a particular case  when there is need is inherent in  the  power of the  court, State  v.  Gauthier, 113  Ore. 297,  231 Pac.  141 (1925).

'6The statutes vary:  ILL. REV. STAT. ch. 38, § 748 (1961)-four months; Mo.  REV. STAT. §  545.900 (1959)-by the  end of the  third term,  after indictment,  found or  information filed, if  on bail.

1SALASKA COMP. LAWS ANN. § 66-1-2 (1949).

ALA. CODE tit. 15, §§  15-227,  260,  261  (1953). Exclusive indictable offenses being  all felonies with  original jurisdiction in  Circuit Court.  Defendant  can waive indictment and plead  guilty except  in capital offenses.

CONN. GEN. STAT. ANN. §  54-46 (1958).  Limited to  crime punishable by death  or  life imprisonment.

DEL.  Sup. Cr. R. 7. Must indict in capital cases, but  may  waive in other crimes.

FLA.  STAT. §  904.01 (1961).  Capital cases.  (Provision in  section 905.20  for use  of  grand  jury of  another county  if judge  decides  it  is  practical.)

GA. CODE §§ 2-105, 27-704 (1933). Indictments required in all  cases, but may waive in  all  except  capital offenses.

ILL. CONST. art. 1, § 8. ILL. REV. STAT. tit. 38, § 702. Except misdemeanor cases.

IND.  ANN. STAT. §§ 9-712, -908  (1933). Provides  prosecution by affidavit (same as information) if  no grand  jury  is  in session, except  treason  and murder.

IOWA CONST. art. 1, §  10. Provides  that information can be used only in Justice of Peace Court. Indictments are  required for  felonies. However, by statute (IOWA CODE §§  769.1-.7 (1962)) information  may be filed  for indictable offenses, but  requires approval  of  the  judge (a form of one man grand  jury).

Ky. CONST. § 12. Ky. R. CRIM.  P. 6.02. Indictment required for  indictable offenses  (felonies).

LA. REv. STAT. §  15:209 (1950). Required  in  all  capital cases.

Miss. CONST. art. 3, §  26, provides  for  information  and indictment, but Miss.  CONST.  art. 3, §  27 provides that no  information will be allowed  for  indictable offenses, which means offenses  triable in inferior courts.

MD. CONST. BILL  OF RIGHTS § 21;  MD. ANN. CODE art. 27, § 592  (1957); MD.  RULES 708, 709.  Information permitted in  misdemeanor cases  and may be waived in felonies.

N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. H§ 601:1-:2  (1955). Required in all  cases  punishable by death  or  one year  imprisonment, but  may  waive except  in capital offenses.

d. Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Vermont.

20 This  is  true in  all  states not  listed in  note 18 and the  limited exceptions in note 19.

21 Complaints  are  often used  in  lower  courts for  misdemeanors  with  informations and/or indictments for  felonies. NEV.  REV. STAT. §§ 169.120, 185.020 (1961). The term affidavit or accusation is  used in certain states to  mean  either complaint or information. E.g., GA. CODE § 27-7 (1933);  IND. ANN. STAT. § 9-908 (1933).

CODE ANN. in  the  opinion  of  the  judge  of  the  district court  the  public  interest demands it. IOWA CODE §§  761.1-.2  (1962). Contra to its  constitution allows  use of information when grand  jury is not  in  session, if  approved by judge. N.D. CENT. CODE § 29-09-09 (1960).  Grand jury  is  to  be called only  if  the judge  thinks there is  a need or  the  board  of  county  commissioners  ask or request by petition of  ten  per  cent of  the  voters for  governor  in  the  county in  the  last election.

22 E.g., UTAH § 77-18-1 (1953).  Grand jury  is  called only  when

23 The last grand jury  called  in the  State of North Dakota was  due to  a

feud (among  other  reasons) between the  State's Attorney  and  the District Judge.  If  anything, it  proved to  the people  of the state  that  a  grand jury should  never  be called. The State's Attorney  was the  winner  in North Dakota. For indirect story  see,  State ex rel. Ilvedson v.  District Court,  70 N. Dak. 17, 291 N.W. 620 (1940).

26 Supra note 18.

27 One will often  find the  report of  a grand  jury complimenting  the  assistant for  his  outstanding devotion  to  duty.  The assistant in large  offices often  is a specialist in  handling grand  juries, and unquestionably schooled, as  we  all  should be,  in good public  relations and practical, if  not  formal  psychology.  The prosecuting  attorney has the  duty  and  right to  be present  when  the  grand jury is  hearing  evidence  and is excluded only  when  the grand jury  members  are deliberating and voting. No  one else, not  even the  judge,  has that right. E.g., ARrz. Sup. Cr. R. 100. Exceptions might be when  the  grand  jury is  investigating the  prosecuting attorney's office. E.g., S.D. CODE § 34:1222 (1939).

28 Many  statutes discourage grand  juries from going out  on their own  spethe  grand  jury  is  not  an "arm" of the  prosecu-

29 GA.  CODE § 27-7 (1933)  provides for  presentments, but  in  § 27-703,  the statute provides  that presentments are  to  be treated the  same  as  indictments. HAWAII CONST. art. I, § 8.  Provides for  presentment in  the same language  as the  United  States Constitution, but  nothing more is  stated in  the  statutes, much  the  same as  in  the  United  States Code.

cifically and others by innuendo do not give  the  grand  juries a free  hand. Although  it has  been stated that tion, such  words do not  necessarily stop it from being  such.  See N.J. REv. STAT. ANN. § 2A:158-4 (1951), and ex parte Peart, 5 Cal.  App.2d 469, 43 P.2d 334 (1935).

IDAHO CODE ANN. §§  19-1201 (1947). Provides for  presentment as a formal statement, but  nothing  concrete is  given  as  to  its use.

MINN. STAT. §§ 628.01,  -. 15  (1961).  Seems  to  have  the  only  clear  statutory definition as to  its use,  making a distinct differentiation between a presentment and an indictment. In substance  it  states that  a presentment  by a grand jury  is  an informal  statement of reasonable grounds  that  an offense has taken  place  and that a person  has  committed  such an offense, but  the

court will  determine  the  exact  type  of crime  committed.  The same  number of  jurors required to  find  an indictment is also  required to  make  a presentment.

NEV. REV. STAT. § 172.230 (1961). Gives typical definition of  presentment as "Informal  statement representing a  public  offense  committed and  reasonable  grounds that defendant  committed it."

N.C. GEN. STAT. §§ 15-137-139  (1953). Provides  that if a  presentment is  made, the  names of the  grand  jurors and witnesses must be on  the  presentment.  It  has been held to be only an instruction to the  prosecuting attorney to frame a  bill  of indictment. A presentment  is an  accusation made ex mero moto,  upon own  knowledge  without  bill of indictment having been submitted by the public  prosecuting attorney. Historically it has been proven  ineffective. See State  v.  Thomas, 236 N.C. 454, 73  S.E.2d 283 (1952).

ORE. REV. STAT. § 132-37 (Supp. 1950). Provides  that  a  presentment  of facts shall be made  to  the  court, when  there is doubt  as to  whether  such facts constitute a crime  at  law,  and the  court then  is  to  instruct he  grand jury  in regard  thereto.

S.D. CODE § 34.1217 (1939). Presentment as defined  in  Nevada.

R.I. CONST. art. 1, § 7. Also follows United  States Constitution, but  nothing in  statute.

31 Recently  a controversy involving the  question of  reports came  out  when the  grand  jury  gave a report calling Kansas City, Missouri  a "Playground  for Criminals," and made  some  rather questionable statements in this report. See: Oliver, John, Inquiry into the  Power  of  a  Missouri Grand  Jury, 30 KAN. CrrY L. REV.  200 (1962).

3 2  E.g., ARIZ. Sup.  Or. R. 103. Provides  that there  must be sufficient legal evidence, and if  doubt, should  ask the  county  attorney. IDAHO CODE ANN. § 19-1105 (1947).

NEv.  REV. STAT. § 172.260 (1961). Provides  for the  use of legal  evidence to  the  exclusion of  hearsay.

Obviously  these  are  only statutory guides  and it is  up to  the  prosecuting attorney whether stated so,  as in Arizona,  or not, as there  is  no way  of knowing whether  only  legal  evidence  was  used to  make  this determination and there  is no  way  to attack the use of "illegal" evidence.  Only  the prosecuting attorney and the  grand  jury  members  are present at  the  time of  the  receipt of the  testimony and evidence.

33 E.g., IDAHO CODE ANN. § 19-1106  (1947). Provides  that the  grand jury is  not  bound to  hear  the  defendant's witnesses and evidence, but  may  do so to explain  away  the  charge. Again, these  statutes are merely  "suggestions" without  any method to  enforce, except  as a practical matter  if  the  prosecuting attorney suggests this be done.

34Supra note  32. Again, obviously, whether  or not  there  is  sufficient evidence will  be more or less  guided by the  prosecuting attorney's "suggestions" to  the  jury, rather than  on their own  knowledge which must be limited. Usually lawyers  are not  on the  grand jury, but it  has occurred. For a case involving seven lawyers  on the  grand  jury  see State v.  Davies,  146 Conn. 137, 148 A.2d 251  (1959).  The Dean of  the  University of Kansas City  Law  School was foreman  of  a grand  jury in  Kansas City.

35 The number  needed for  an indictment varies from five  out  of six (IND. ANN. STAT. § 9-901 (1933)), and five  out of  seven (e.g., VA.  CODE ANN. §§  19.1148,  -150 (1950)) to  the  typical grand  jury requiring twelve  out  of  twenty-three (e.g., ILL. REV. STAT. ch. 78, §§ 16 and 17 (1%1)).

8 6 Hurtado  v.  California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884).

87 This  advantage  continues today. However, in the  historical beginning, if the  grand  jury  did  not  do as it was expected, the  judge  might  fine  or  imprison the  jurors. The Grand Jury, 30 KAN. CITY L. REV. 149, 151 (1962).

It is  frequently provided  that  the prosecuting witness' name  be subscribed to  the  indictment having doubtful validity, for  the  purpose  of  holding the  person liable for  costs  and  also  additional asurance  that the  witness will  prosecute the  case  to  its finality and not  use it for  the  purpose  of extorting money  or recovering  property.

meant to  say that the  judges' committee,  nor other groups  sharing  their view that the  grand  jury  is ". . . a sword and a shield  of  Justice-a sword because it is  the  terror of  criminals, a shield because  it is  the  protection of the  innocent against unjust prosecution . . ." are  not  thinking, merely that  they  lack  some "realistic thinking."

54 E.g., LA. REV. STAT.  § 15:340 (1950).  OHIO REV. CODE ANN. § 2938.04 (Baldwin Supp.  1961).  As a practical matter  it is  true in most states that trials of misdemeanors are  tried by the  court, but  a jury  trial is  generally provided for  if  desired. In  a few states, trials of  felonies by jury  are  the  exceptions to  the rule.

5 E.g., ALA.  CODE tit. 15, § 321  (1958). In  misdemeanor cases. CoLo.  REV. STAT.  ANN. § 79-15-4 (1953).  In  cases  before  Justice of  the  Peace.

If nothing is  stated in  the  statutes of  a state about  the  right of  waiver, it  is generally understood  that one can waive a constitutional right to  trial by jury. See: e.g., State v.  Hernandez, 123 P.2d 38.

60 Supra note 28. Recently  the prosecuting attorney of Jackson County (Kansas City), Missouri, stated  that  robbery  cases  were  being  processed  too slowly  through  the  use  of  the  information, because  of the  delays  caused  by defense motions for continuances in connection  with preliminary  hearings.  In order  to speed matters along,  the prosecuting attorney stated  he would  use indictments in all robbery  cases.

61 Usually  those  defendants who  are  being  held  to  answer a criminal charge may  challenge a juror or  the  panel  before  the  jurors are  sworn. E.g., Mo.  REV. STAT. § 540.060  (1959).

64 There  are  some provisions for  habitual criminal or multiple offender trials by jury, where the  defendant's prior record  is  in issue. These cases, of course, are  limited only to  the  multiple offender  and defendants are rather rarely  so prosecuted. 65

E.g., ARK. STAT. § 43-2324 (Supp. 1961).

68 ARiz. REV. STAT.  ANN. § 11-533 (1956); NEv. REV. STAT. § 176.080 (1961). District attorney to  give  recommendations;  S.D. CODE § 34.3704 (1939); Wyo. STAT. ANN. § 7-348 (1957). For sex  crimes.

67 Some  interesting features include  statutory given trial de novo in the Supreme Court  of  Alabama by the  defendant, if  he should  agree  to  try the  case without  a jury. ALA. CODE  tit. 15, § 322  (1958). This  is  obviously  pointed to  encourage trials without  juries. Although such a provision is not uncommon in civil cases, at  least statutory provisions of such a trial de novo in  criminal cases are rare. Appeals are often  automatic  where  the defendant  is sentenced  to death. E.g., ALA. CODE tit. 15, § 328  (1958). Seemingly  the  right of  the  defendant  to  appeal is  limited in  Maine and other States. ME.  REV. STAT. ANN. ch. 148, § 30 (1954).

68 Typically the  defendant can  obtain a new  trial from the  trial court if  the trial court can be persuaded  that it was in  error.

69 CONN. GEN.  STAT. REV. § 54-96 (1958). Appeals on question of law are permitted by the  state, if  permission of  the  presiding judge  is  obtained, in the same  manner as an appeal by the  accused.  It  should  be noted that  although this "right" of  appeal by the  state can actually reverse a conviction, the  permission  must be obtained  by a judge,  who  has  had a "hand" in the  prosecutor's appointment. The statute was  held constitutional in Palko  v. Conn.,  302  U.S. 319,  58 Sup.  CT. 149  (1937).

VT.  STAT.  ANN.  tit. 13, § 7403  (1958).  "In a  prosecution by complaint, information  or  indictment for  a felony  or  misdemeanor,  upon exceptions taken  by the  state, questions of law decided  against the  state by a county  or municipal court  shall be allowed  and placed  upon the  record  before  final judgment. When such exceptions  are so taken and  allowed,  in its  discretion such court  may pass  the  same to  the  Supreme Court before Ainal  judgment. (Italics mine) The Supreme  Court  shall  hear  and determine  the questions upon such exceptions and render  final  judgment thereon, or remand  the cause to such county  or municipal  court  for  further trial or other  proceedings as justice and the  state of  the  cause  may  require." See State v.  Green Mt. Power Corp., 113 Vt.  34, 28 A.2d (1942);  State  v.  Pierce, 120 Vt. 373, 141 A.2d 419 (1958). The Constitution  of  Vermont contains no provision against double  jeopardy  and the  statute giving the  state the  right of  exception in  criminal cases  equals in  all respects that possessed by a defendant, has  been held  not  to  be an infringment of  due process in  state or  Federal Constitutions. See State v.  Desso, 110 Vt. 1,  1A.2d 710 (1938).

In  many states this is  done as  a matter of  general practice, even to  the  appointment of  the  county  attorney as  an assistant attorney general in  order  to  circumvent the  statute.
