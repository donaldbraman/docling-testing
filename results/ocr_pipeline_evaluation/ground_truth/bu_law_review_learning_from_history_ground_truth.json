While the experiences of Black Americans in the United States may have been one of the most central influences to the development of this theory,[2]Critical Race Theory has both contributed to and learned from critical legal movements focused on feminism, Latino/a/x people, Asian Americans, queer people, Native Americans, and even Whiteness.[3]However, even as studies of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality became entwined within Critical Race Theory, the study and analysis of the U.S. class system was largely not undertaken under the Critical Race Theory umbrella until relatively recently.[4]",

The rise of China as an emerging global superpower that can be seen as improving the lives of the poor within its own borders and investing in the growth of other nations provides a potential analog to Cold-War-era Soviet Union; and the emergence of certain class-oriented movements within the United States has the potential to play the role that the Civil Rights movement played in the 1950s and 1960s, providing the opportunity for a new class-based interest convergence.",

Williams,[92]a case that upheld Maryland’s maximum family welfare limit.[93]Many scholars believe the Supreme Court has since declared that the poor are not a suspect class for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.[94]Overturning this belief would subject laws that discriminate on the basis of class to either strict scrutiny (if the class is suspect) or intermediate scrutiny (if the class is quasi-suspect).[95]To survive strict scrutiny, a classification on the basis of a suspect class must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and be necessary to accomplish a legitimate governmental purpose, whereas to survive intermediate scrutiny, a classification on the basis of a quasi-suspect class must serve an important governmental objective and be substantially related to that objective.[96]",

The American method of financing public education with local property taxes ensures that schools located in areas where poor children live are poorly funded while schools located where wealthy children live are funded lavishly.[124]Parents and activists have sought, with limited success, an enduring legal solution to this inequitable system since their hopes that the Supreme Court might find it unconstitutional were dashed in 1973.[125]The average revenue of a school district that is over 75% White is $2,226 more per pupil than the average revenue of a school district that is over 75% nonwhite.[126]Additionally, there is a significant link between racial school segregation and academic achievement gaps, driven largely by this racial difference in school poverty.[127]",

Dudziak notes that by around 1966, the Vietnam War had significantly eclipsed domestic race relations in the United States as the defining feature of international viewpoints of the United States.[128]Five years later, the Supreme Court’s new conservative Chief Justice noted the “reconciliation of competing values”[129]in desegregation cases, and shortly after that the Court began limiting federal power to mandate desegregation.[130]The international usefulness of active desegregation efforts had worn off, and the stage was set for retrenchment.",

InA Simple Dialogue, Bell sketches out an alternative history based on the Court ruling against the Black plaintiffs inBrown, concluding that a loss may have energized the Black struggle and redoubled efforts to support Black schools.[131]Assuming class-based interest convergence leads to a win or two, the lesson inSimple Dialogueis to keep the pedal to the metal and continue pushing for more.
