The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea is of equal power: that one must never, in one’s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one’s strength.[5]",

I am not certain I am fully convinced that the work of the man who litigatedBrown v. Board of Education[8]can in fact peacefully coexist with that of the man who insisted thatBrownwas made possible only because it did not threaten “the superior societal status of middle and upper class whites.”[9]But my skepticism in believing that it is within our reach to “enact a radical vision”[10]of the Constitution perhaps speaks more to the limits of my own moral imagination than it does to Professor Hasbrouck’s persuasiveness. Indeed, by the time I finishedThe Antiracist Constitution, I very much wanted to believe. And still do.",

      "text": "TheAntiracist Constitutionbegins with the irrefutable point that for more than two centuries the Supreme Court has read the Constitution as an instrument of white supremacy such that, when faced with fundamental questions of Black freedom and equality, the Court’s recurring pattern has been to initially refuse to recognize our full humanity; then to acknowledge our rights only belatedly, grudgingly, and conditionally; and finally to diminish, restrict, and even repudiate those rights whenever and however it becomes politically palatable for the Court to do so. By itself, this statement is such commonplace that it hardly seems worth bothering to offer evidence to prove it. But it is still extraordinary to read collected in a single place—as Professor Hasbrouck does in his Article—the catalog of what he calls “a multidisc boxed set of racist decisions hits.”[11]",

Indeed, to the extent that the heart of his argument is the recognition that from the moment our constitutional democracy proclaimed “We the People” Black people always understood the Constitution as an instrument of their liberation, Professor Hasbrouck is undoubtedly correct. From Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, from the first corps of Black legislators elected to Congress after the War to members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, from Black soldiers who enlisted with the United States Colored Troops in the fight to save the Union to Black parents who sent their children in harm’s way to integrate segregated schools, Black people always understood the Constitution as the key to freedom and equality in ways that the drafters themselves never fully appreciated. More to the point, Professor Hasbrouck demonstrates how this radical abolitionist view of both the 1789 and Reconstruction constitutions was not—is not—a mere strategic rhetorical device, but rather can form the basis of what he calls a new antiracist Constitution.",

      "text": "Ironically, Professor Hasbrouck’s antiracist Constitution owes an intellectual debt to Justice John Harlan, whose dissent inPlessy v. Ferguson—proclaiming that court constitution is color blind—was in fact a thinly veiled endorsement of white supremacy.[41]For, while Justice Harlan’s dissent is often cited with great, if misguided, reverence, his earlier dissent in theCivil Rights Casesis the one deserving of respect because it articulated a vision of an antiracist Constitution. There, Justice Harlan explained that, if the 1787 Constitution, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793,[42]the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,[43]and the Court’s own decisions inPrigg,Ableman v. Booth,[44]andDred Scott, enlisted Federal government authority to enforce human subjugation,[45]the Reconstruction Amendments and accompanying Federal legislation were “adopted in the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, . . . rights inhering in the state of freedom, and belonging to American citizenship.”[46]According to Justice Harlan’s reading, the Reconstruction Amendments “did something more than to prohibit slavery as aninstitution. . . [they] established and decreed universalcivil freedomthroughout the United States.”[47]Justice Harlan’s interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments drew a crucial link between the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant, in Section 1, of birthright citizenship. According to Harlan, this interplay between the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments meant that Congress had full power to protect those rights “fundamental to citizenship in a free government.”[48]The Reconstruction Amendments and acts designed to enforce them were meant “to compel a recognition of the legal right of the black race to take that rank of citizens, and to secure the enjoyment of privileges belonging, under the law, to themas a component of the people for whose welfare and happiness government is ordained.”[49]What Professor Hasbrouck does is give substance to Justice Harlan’s theory of a new right to civil freedom, to show how, when read together and in the spirit in which they were drafted, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments may yet and finally remove the remaining badges of slavery and racial caste and return Congress to its rightful role of protecting freedom and equality for all.[50]",

      "text": "Bell had started his career as a civil rights litigator, first in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and then as counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (“LDF”). There, working with Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and Robert Carter, among others, Bell spent a decade trying to enforceBrown v. Board of Educationwhile litigating hundreds of school desegregation cases in Mississippi. But, barely ten years after leaving the LDF, Bell would write that his own work on these cases had “helped to precipitate a rise in militant white opposition and . . . seriously eroded carefully cultivated judicial support,”[52]and that “the hoped-for improvement in schooling for black children that might have justified the sacrifice and risk . . . prove[d] minimal at best.”[53]Bell was clear-eyed in recognizing that political, economic, and social conditions contributed to the lack of meaningful progress for Black children. And yet, he also insisted, seemingly more in sadness than anger, that the generation of civil rights lawyers who wonBrownhad tried unsuccessfully to serve two masters: the need to obtain a good education for the children of Black parents who were their putative clients, and the desire to enforceBrown’s equal protection principle of maximum desegregation of public schools. And, unable to serve these two masters, lawyers, such as Bell, had sacrificed the practical interests of Black parents to obtain a good education for their children in service of a “single-minded commitment to racial balance, a goal which, standing alone, is increasingly inaccessible and all too often educationally impotent.”[54]",

Looking back over twenty-five years of litigation, Bell came to believe thatBrowncould not “be understood without some consideration of the decision’s value to whites, not simply those concerned about the immorality of racial inequality, but also those whites in policymaking positions able to see the economic and political advances at home and abroad that would follow abandonment of segregation.”[55]As Bell put it, “[t]he interest of blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of whites.”[56]",

All such hopes faded by the time he urged those in the fight for Black liberation to “recognize and acknowledge (at least to ourselves) that our actions are not likely to lead to transcendent change and may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help.”[64]",

Justice Thurgood Marshall, from whom Bell had picked upBrown’s baton, also spoke of the miracle of Black constitutionalism in a speech at the annual trade seminar of a patent and trademark law association in Maui, Hawaii.[67]The speech, which would later be published as a law review article under the titleReflections on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution,[68]offered a corrective to the “proud proclamations of the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice shared by the framers and reflected in a written document now yellowed with age.”[69]Justice Marshall explained that he did not find “the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the framers to be particularly profound,” and that the “government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for individual freedoms and human rights, that we hold as fundamental today.”[70]In just five pages, Justice Marshall sketched out a vision of the Constitution: “While the Union survived the Civil War, the Constitution did not.”[71]Rather, what arose in the place of the 1789 document was “a living document” born out of the “suffering, struggle, and sacrifice” of the very people the original Constitution once considered property and not people.[72]To Justice Marshall, if the phrase “We the people” had come to hold any real meaning for American citizens, “credit does not belong to the framers” but rather to those who, over generations of struggle and strife, “refused to acquiesce to outdated notions of ‘liberty,’ ‘justice,’ and ‘equality,’ and who strived to better them.”[73]Thus, his living Constitution did not merely change with the changing times, unguided by any north star, unanchored to any fixed principles, but was rooted in the hopes and dreams of the slaves and their descendants who had, through two turbulent centuries, nurtured it into a “true miracle.”[74]",
