Yet, law and culture are quite different, though they relate to and affect each other. Therefore, it is desirable to examine their similarities and differences and their relationship. While the structures of law and culture are more similar than we might expect, their differences greatly affect the enforcement of the rules issued under each.",

Yet, law and culture differ in fundamental details, including: (a) the identity of those who initiate the rules; (b) the rules’ underlying purposes and values; (c) how these rules are (i) initiated, (ii) developed, (iii) expressed, (iv) and enforced; and (d) the extent of their acceptance by those to whom they apply.",

This assumption applies both to those who impose the rules and those who are subjects to the rules. Their relationships may affect the level of benefits that they bestow, and the level of obedience to the rules imposed on others.",

Throughout their lives, however, they learn to cooperate and to offer their services to one another. These services can be partly genetic. . . However, unlike many animals, whose reliability to serve others is genetic, humans’ reliability to serve and support others is more volitional. In addition, humans may not have a genetic bar against hurting each other. Thus, dependence on others exposes the human dependents to the danger of abuse by those on whom they depend.[1]The power to provide or withhold support, and to coerce rather than convince and agree, can destroy human societies. The drive to survive has led humans to regulate supportive and destructive power of humans against each other. That is where human groups that imposed restrictions and duties on humans direct or indirect power over each other.",

Classroom laughter may start with one student’s giggle that cannot stop even by the teacher’s frown or order, until a number of students cease laughing and the rest follow. Fashion demonstrates this tendency as well. For example, before the Second World War women had let their hair grow long. However, shortly after the war began, this changed, and short hair became the fashion. The reason may have been the enrollment of the women in military services and the rise and timing of their working hours.[3]After the war ended, the trend did not change immediately. It took time for one habit to overcome the other, for the hairdressers to open more shops, and for a younger generation to take over fashion leadership.[4]",

We start by examining the sources from which these rules and norms originate and the needs to which they respond. The emergence of rules originate from the needs formulated by the community to which those rules regulate. The normative character of rules correspond, above all, to the need to remove the state of chaos, disorder, unpredictability. The ordering of the rules of societal coexistence, regardless of the epoch and geography, has been considered necessary and beneficial for the group. Such a need, to organize a desired model of order, could be met by both legal as well as cultural rules. The relationship between law and culture rooted in values is underlined by the definition –ius est ars boni et aequi– used by the ancient Romans, who considered law to be the art of good and justice.[7]If law was an art, it has certainly also been an element of the culture.

Among other ways, culture could be understood as a distinction from nature. Culture appears at the moment of any human intervention into anything that a human meets or creates that has not been transformed by human intervention earlier. Etymologically, it refers to cultivation. In fact, it is a primary meaning when humans began to order and at the same time subjugate nature, to interfere with it. The word “cult” included in this notion pertains to the morphological meaning of cultivation of the soil, and then the soul. In this sense culture includes a religion as well.",

In this context emerges the crucial role of language as a part of an organized way of communicating, transmitting the coded messages, among people. Similarly, language as a means of this transmission plays an important role in law and in culture. It is an integral part of culture and sometimes equally culture is a part of what language describes. To the same extent language gives a substance to words and forms a way of articulating legal rules while at the same time law must be expressed in a language. Indeed, no sophisticated law can exist without being verbalized. Without a verbal and written language, the “language” of signs and actions cannot go very far.",

Does culture have a cure to prevent violations of rules? According to Edward. B. Tylor, culture is composed of elements such as knowledge, arts, ethics, laws, customs, and other societal skills and habits created throughout history.[8]Describing it more generally and analytically, Bierstedt assesses that culture is composed of everything that humans do, think, and own.[9]Consequently, three types of cultures can be differentiated: (i) normative culture, (ii) ideal (symbolic) culture and (iii) material culture. This division, which is useful in anthropological and sociological analysis, may be relatively less useful while studying the interrelation of cultural and legal rules. For the purpose of this article, we assume that the culturesensu largoembraces also law, science, art, religion, namely all products of mindful and directional activities of humans, built across the times, across geographies and civilizations. In these contexts, to paraphrase Arthur Schopenhauer, “Es gibt nur eine Kultur und alle verschiedene Kulturen sind nur die Teile derselben.” There is only one culture—continuous, flowing, growing, uniting humanity and all its varieties are only parts of this culture and belong to it.[10]",

The cultural norm, as compared to the legal norm, is far less tangible.
