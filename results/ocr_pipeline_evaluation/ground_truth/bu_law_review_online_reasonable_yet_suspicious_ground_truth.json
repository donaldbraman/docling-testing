Upon seeing an approaching police car, they ran away.[1]Mr. Washington maintained that he feared for his safety given the tenuous relationship between police and Black men, which in Baltimore had proven explosive after the 2015 police killing of Freddie Gray.[2]Thus, he insisted that his reasonable, fear-based flight from police should not contribute to the “reasonable suspicion” required for those officers to stop and search him.[3]In December, the Maryland Supreme Court[4]conceded that Mr. Washington’s flight from police was a reasonable reaction amid public instances of police violence against young Black men, especially in Baltimore, and empirical evidence of racialized policing.[5]While engaging with Mr. Washington’s arguments and those of courts that discount “flight from police” and “high-crime area” as factors in the reasonable suspicion calculus because of their racialized application, the court concluded that Mr. Washington’s unprovoked flight in a high-crime area gave officers the reasonable suspicion required.[6]",

Wardlow, the Supreme Court concluded that flight from police in a high-crime neighborhood was suggestive of wrongdoing and could be sufficient to support aTerrystop.[10]There, Mr. Wardlow looked at the uniformed police officers as they drove by him and fled. He was ultimately followed, cornered, stopped, and searched. The Court concluded that “[h]eadlong flight—wherever it occurs—is the consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such.”[11]Justice Stevens clarified that anyper serule about flight from police in a high-crime area was unwarranted. He cautioned that flight from police may not reflect criminality “[a]mong some citizens, particularly minorities and those residing in high crime areas, there is . . . the possibility that the fleeing person is entirely innocent, but, with or without justification, believes that contact with police can itself be dangerous, apart from any criminal activity associated with the officer’s sudden presence.”[12]",

Increased awareness that young Black men are disproportionately likely to be the victims of police violence, combined with the specific history of police misconduct in Baltimore, rendered his own fear of mistreatment at the hands of police reasonable.[29]Mr. Washington relied upon three categories in support of his argument: (1) empirical data confirming that Black men are disproportionately stopped, searched, arrested by police, and more likely to be subject to the use of force;[30](2) the proliferation of publicly disseminated footage depicting police violence against Black men, making flight a reasonable reaction;[31]and (3) particular events such as the prominent death of Freddie Gray in police custody, the Department of Justice’s documented investigation into Baltimore City Police, and the recent scandal within the Gun Trace Task Force, which affirmed a fear of police among Baltimore city residents.[32]Within this context, Mr. Washington reasoned thatWardlow’s conclusion—that unprovoked flight from police suggests criminal wrongdoing—is profoundly outdated. Instead, flight from police reflects a reasonable fear for one’s safety and merits minimal or no weight in establishing reasonable suspicion.",

An officer saw Mr. Warren with another young Black man walking in Boston and believed that they matched the general description provided by a burglary victim earlier that night. Upon being asked by the officer to “wait a minute,” the two men ran into a park. The SJC concluded that the victim’s description of the perpetrator, proximity to the alleged burglary, and the defendant’s flight did not constitute reasonable suspicion.[33]Focusing on a report documenting a pattern of racial profiling of Black men in Boston, the court recognized “a reason for flight totally unrelated to the consciousness of guilt,” explaining that Mr. Warren’s flight “might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled.” Thus, flight from police should be given “little, if any, weight as a factor probative in reasonable suspicion.”[34]",

[B]lacks who have walked, run, or raced away from inquisitive police officers have ended up beaten and battered and sometimes dead.”[50]It is thus not surprising that “Black people often tread more carefully around law enforcement,”[51]reasonably believing based on “pervasive” and “persuasive” evidence, that “contact with the police can itself be dangerous.”[52]",
