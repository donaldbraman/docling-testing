      "text": "Despite ongoing disagreement about how the Constitution allocates powers among the different branches, the two dominant schools of thought in American separation-of-powers debates—formalism and functionalism—agree on three premises: Certain powers inhere in certain government branches, some powers are vested exclusively in one or another branch, and the judiciary is the final arbiter of separation-of-powers disputes. Disagreement is largely about how powers should be parsed and which should be shared. Yet over the long lifespan of our constitutional tradition, momentous doctrinal upheavals are relatively commonplace. This Article describes four tectonic shifts in separation-of-powers doctrine: Founding-era debates about how to define and blend powers, nineteenth-century debates about the constitutionality of the nascent civil service,Lochner-era debates about legislatures’ authority to define and regulate public utilities, and mid-nineteenth-century debates about the sources of international law. The first, which we call the Inherency Theory, assumes that certain powers and functions are vested by force of the Constitution, are core to a single branch, and are discernible by the judiciary. This is a taxonomical theory of how the Constitution allocates powers, and it animates nearly all of today’s separation-of-powers debates. The second, an Antidomination Theory, denies that the words executive, legislative, and judicial imply any new or distinct powers and instead creates formal separation between the three branches based on the procedures federal actors deploy to enact, enforce, and interpret policy. The third, a rights-based Public Utility Theory, distinguishes between a public sphere that is subject to congressional, presidential, and administrative control, and a private sphere that is not. Recently, this public-private distinction has been marshalled to define the judicial power. Historically, however, it was used to deduce a whole panoply of structural limits, including the constitutionality of agency adjudication and deference. And the fourth, a General Law approach, discerns the limits of government power by reference to the eclectic authority of the common law and right reason. Recovering these theories reveals a rich set of tools for resolving interdepartmental disputes, highlights that current receptions of past settlements are nearly unintelligible without understanding the theoretical context in which they emerged, and suggests that, while different theories have risen and fallen, no one theory of separation of powers has been liquidated in our constitutional tradition.",

To that end, both think that the Constitution distributes powers among three coequal branches and the states,[2]that some powers are enumerated and others implied, that the separation of powers operates as a restraint on government overreach, and that the judiciary should arbitrate separation-of-powers disputes. Disagreement is primarily about specifics: How many powers does the Constitution imply? What are they? Does the Constitution blend or mix powers among the branches? And what historical moments are relevant in discerning the limits of congressional and presidential power?",

Consider, for example, nineteenth-century debates about the President’s authority to remove civil service officials. Snippets of this long constitutional contest have become canonical moments in the debate about the President’s authority to remove administrative officials. But the removal issue has not always been framed as being about the President’s relationship to Congress. During the nineteenth century, arguments about the President’s authority to fire members of the civil service were often based on policymakers’ views about political science,[3]by appeals to a higher order such as divine providence or right reason, or as primarily implicating the government’s relationship to individual rights. In other words, constitutional theorists advanced unfamiliar structural arguments to try—unsuccessfully—to resolve one of our most familiar structural disputes.",

It instead stipulated processes by which the legislative and executive branches could enact legally binding policies: Legislation must be enacted through bicameralism and presentment, and the President must act via express statutory or constitutional authorization. The constitutionally relevant fact was that each branch respected the Constitution’s procedural constraints. To be sure, other structural theories travelled alongside this view, but for some early interpreters of the Constitution, the drafters’ political theory focused on the document’s procedural checks as the “practical” elaboration of the core idea, not on metaphysical appeals to the concept of “executive,” “legislative,” or “judicial.”[6]",

Courts used the distinction between public rights and public enterprises, on the one hand, and private rights and private enterprises, on the other, to ground the constitutionality of agency deference, adjudication, and rulemaking. Many of today’s separation-of-powers concerns were therefore subsumed under the question of thepublicityof the actor subject to regulatory oversight. This reasoning is typically associated with theLochnerera and, to our knowledge, has not been understood as a theory of interbranch relations.[7]Yet, in providing the decisive test to determine when government could control private conduct, the Public Utility idea also came to settle interbranch disputes about legislatures’, agencies’, and courts’ roles in regulating economic activity.",

In this view, the meaning of the Constitution changed based on evolving practical considerations. For example, within a four-decade period in the nineteenth century, concern about the effectiveness of the civil service was used to justify both presidential removal of civil servants and Congress’s role in regulating removal. Initially, corruption in the civil service justified heightened removal powers and a rotation-in-office system.[11]Then, a decade later, concern about the government’s inability to retain expert administrators caused the tide to shift toward more robust removal protections.[12]These were thought not to reflect incompatible theories of the executive power, but rather an understanding that constitutional principles should evolve with changing economic and political circumstances.[13]Cases from this fourth category have been marshaled to support different theories of departmental limits, many of which have continued relevance in modern formalist and functionalist debates. However, this category was based on a wholly different constitutional cast of mind: one in which structural limitations followed from a political-scientific inquiry that could be answered through both philosophical reasoning and political empirics.",

Yet in the early 1800s, in response to concerns about administrative corruption, consecutive Senate reports urged that the Decision of 1789 be “reconsidered by Congress whenever experience should demonstrate the necessity of interposing to arrest the abuse of the power by a less scrupulous and more ambitious Executive.”[26]",

It therefore violates a formalist separation of powers, since it involves the exercise of legislative power by a non-legislative actor.[36]The same mode of reasoning applies to the President’s authority to remove administrative officials. Article II vests executive powers in the President.[37]According to formalists, that grant conveys exclusive authority to supervise executive departments and thus carries with it the power to appoint and remove personnel.[38]While the appointment power is formally shared with Congress, the Constitution’s silence about removal suggests that the residual power must be the President’s alone. Accordingly, when Congress imposes restrictions on the President’s authority to remove administrative officials, it interferes with the President’s power to execute the law.[39]",

For example, Congress possesses impeachment and appropriations powers; the President possesses the commander-in-chief power; and the judiciary possesses the power to decide cases or controversies arising under the Constitution.[72]It would violate the separation of powers for impeachment to occur outside the process defined in Article I, for the judiciary to appropriate funds for a new courthouse, for the Senate to instruct the Navy to launch missiles at a foreign adversary, or for the President to issue a judgment in a pending judicial proceeding.

In the past few years, a large amount of scholarship has interrogated and deconstructed historical arguments that have claimed that the Decision of 1789 conclusively determined that Article II implies a plenary removal power.[306]Many recent critiques of the unitary executive position are, in our view, convincing, in part because it is more difficult, as an evidentiary matter, to show that a particular constitutional debate was settled and liquidated over time than it is to deconstruct or unsettle that position. One implication of Part II.D’s survey of removal episodes is that it is possible to find evidence of essentially any position on the removal question if one looks hard enough. Constitutional actors have offered arguments supporting and opposing a removal power, and they have done so for nearly every conceivable reason. Sometimes these arguments resembled modern formalist and functionalist intuitions about the implied meaning of the executive power.[307]At other times, they followed from arguments about how to structure good government.[308]",

This doctrinal point is obvious simply from reading the canonical removal cases, but the lack of separation-of-powers settlements is even more apparent when one examines the modes of constitutional argument that were marshalled during these debates. Beyond the doctrinal flip-flopping about whether Article II’s grant of executive power conveys a removal power, the removal debates also embraced heterodox structural theories. During nineteenth-century civil service arguments, politicians and scholars revisited prior settlements, including the Decision of 1789, because they believed new information suggested a need for a different constitutional rule. Assuming that the Decision of 1789 reflected a constitutional settlement in favor of a strong removal power, shouldn’t it be relevant that, just twenty years later, many of those same politicians reconsidered their prior position out of concern that the President would abuse the removal power to strip the civil service of much-needed expertise? Similarly, shouldn’t it matter that partisans on both sides of the removal question, including during the Decision of 1789 andMyers, argued not from text or structure, but from principles about how to structure an effective federal government? Any claim that the Constitution requires a single rule about removal invariably privileges certain of these episodes and elides others.",

Adjudication was permitted when a regulated entity was clothed with the public interest. Of course, the clause “clothed with the public interest” does not perfectly mimic the phrase “public right.”[313]But that only highlights the extent to which modern doctrine is based on discretionary decisions about which periods are relevant: The question—whether a question of right should be adjudicated in court or before an administrative tribunal—was identical.[314]",

To answer these structural questions, courts draw on twentieth-century deference cases that were decided on the basis of a public-private distinction. Thus, while the jurisprudence of this era—the advent of hard-look review, the supposed omnipresence of the nondelegation doctrine before the New Deal—is routinely offered today as evidence of a formalist or functionalist past,[319]the usefulness of those precedents is based on holdings that rested on constitutional theories that were explicitly and emphatically discarded in the 1930s.[320]",

The relevant question is whether the federal actor has respected the Constitution’s procedural checks.

While we think the label is apt, we note that it is unusual to find evidence of a political science approach in this era of constitutional law. The period is often cast as having “dissolved into a number of tactical political positions with little coherence or consistency.” M.J.C. Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 289 (2d ed. 1998). And, indeed, this period is seen as the prelude to an account of the rise of political-science approaches in the Progressive era.See, e.g.,id.at 289–322 (describing the rise of political science in separation-of-powers theory as following “a demand for reform that built up through the Granger, Greenback, and Populist movements to its climax in Progressivism” and describing the emergence of administrative governance and a functionalist theory of separated powers as accepting the “multifunctionality of political structures”).

Sometimes, publicness existed because the regulated entity was given a privilege, as occurred when it was given power to exercise eminent domain or a certificate of public convenience and necessity. But the grant of a government privilege was not dispositive. At other times, however, courts found that the entity had become affected with the public interest because it possessed market power or was important to the economy.",

      "text": "Despite ongoing disagreement about how the Constitution allocates powers among the different branches, the two dominant schools of thought in American separation-of-powers debates—formalism and functionalism—agree on three premises: Certain powers inhere in certain government branches, some powers are vested exclusively in one or another branch, and the judiciary is the final arbiter of separation-of-powers disputes. Disagreement is largely about how powers should be parsed and which should be shared. Yet over the long lifespan of our constitutional tradition, momentous doctrinal upheavals are relatively commonplace. This Article describes four tectonic shifts in separation-of-powers doctrine: Founding-era debates about how to define and blend powers, nineteenth-century debates about the constitutionality of the nascent civil service,Lochner-era debates about legislatures’ authority to define and regulate public utilities, and mid-nineteenth-century debates about the sources of international law. The first, which we call the Inherency Theory, assumes that certain powers and functions are vested by force of the Constitution, are core to a single branch, and are discernible by the judiciary. This is a taxonomical theory of how the Constitution allocates powers, and it animates nearly all of today’s separation-of-powers debates. The second, an Antidomination Theory, denies that the words executive, legislative, and judicial imply any new or distinct powers and instead creates formal separation between the three branches based on the procedures federal actors deploy to enact, enforce, and interpret policy. The third, a rights-based Public Utility Theory, distinguishes between a public sphere that is subject to congressional, presidential, and administrative control, and a private sphere that is not. Recently, this public-private distinction has been marshalled to define the judicial power. Historically, however, it was used to deduce a whole panoply of structural limits, including the constitutionality of agency adjudication and deference. And the fourth, a General Law approach, discerns the limits of government power by reference to the eclectic authority of the common law and right reason. Recovering these theories reveals a rich set of tools for resolving interdepartmental disputes, highlights that current receptions of past settlements are nearly unintelligible without understanding the theoretical context in which they emerged, and suggests that, while different theories have risen and fallen, no one theory of separation of powers has been liquidated in our constitutional tradition.",

Snippets of this long constitutional contest have become canonical moments in the debate about the President’s authority to remove administrative officials. But the removal issue has not always been framed as being about the President’s relationship to Congress. During the nineteenth century, arguments about the President’s authority to fire members of the civil service were often based on policymakers’ views about political science,[3]by appeals to a higher order such as divine providence or right reason, or as primarily implicating the government’s relationship to individual rights. In other words, constitutional theorists advanced unfamiliar structural arguments to try—unsuccessfully—to resolve one of our most familiar structural disputes.",

It instead stipulated processes by which the legislative and executive branches could enact legally binding policies: Legislation must be enacted through bicameralism and presentment, and the President must act via express statutory or constitutional authorization. The constitutionally relevant fact was that each branch respected the Constitution’s procedural constraints. To be sure, other structural theories travelled alongside this view, but for some early interpreters of the Constitution, the drafters’ political theory focused on the document’s procedural checks as the “practical” elaboration of the core idea, not on metaphysical appeals to the concept of “executive,” “legislative,” or “judicial.”[6]",

Courts used the distinction between public rights and public enterprises, on the one hand, and private rights and private enterprises, on the other, to ground the constitutionality of agency deference, adjudication, and rulemaking. Many of today’s separation-of-powers concerns were therefore subsumed under the question of thepublicityof the actor subject to regulatory oversight. This reasoning is typically associated with theLochnerera and, to our knowledge, has not been understood as a theory of interbranch relations.[7]Yet, in providing the decisive test to determine when government could control private conduct, the Public Utility idea also came to settle interbranch disputes about legislatures’, agencies’, and courts’ roles in regulating economic activity.",

In this view, the meaning of the Constitution changed based on evolving practical considerations. For example, within a four-decade period in the nineteenth century, concern about the effectiveness of the civil service was used to justify both presidential removal of civil servants and Congress’s role in regulating removal. Initially, corruption in the civil service justified heightened removal powers and a rotation-in-office system.[11]Then, a decade later, concern about the government’s inability to retain expert administrators caused the tide to shift toward more robust removal protections.[12]These were thought not to reflect incompatible theories of the executive power, but rather an understanding that constitutional principles should evolve with changing economic and political circumstances.[13]Cases from this fourth category have been marshaled to support different theories of departmental limits, many of which have continued relevance in modern formalist and functionalist debates. However, this category was based on a wholly different constitutional cast of mind: one in which structural limitations followed from a political-scientific inquiry that could be answered through both philosophical reasoning and political empirics.",

Yet in the early 1800s, in response to concerns about administrative corruption, consecutive Senate reports urged that the Decision of 1789 be “reconsidered by Congress whenever experience should demonstrate the necessity of interposing to arrest the abuse of the power by a less scrupulous and more ambitious Executive.”[26]",

The Senate refused to print the President’s defense of his actions after it censured him, but it did memorialize Jackson’s general-law argument on the floor: A Senate report recounted Jackson’s argument that “all executive power is vested in the President,” citing Vattel, Grotius, Puffendorf, and Blackstone as support.[183]Senator Daniel Webster, one of Jackson’s critics, did not argue that the treatise writers were irrelevant but instead that they furnished no consensus.

Thus, the constitutional issue was whether a peace treaty could mandate that no debts would ever “be sequestered, or confiscated . . . on account of national differences and discontents,” notwithstanding contrary state law.[191]Hamilton defended such treaty provisions by relying “in part” upon the “theoretical writers”[192]who “proved, as the dictate of sound reason, that private debts and private property in public funds, are not justly liable to confiscation or sequestration.”[193]Hamilton prevailed: These treaties entered into force, where they became an important feature of the United States’ effort to gain recognition in the international system.[194]And, eventually, the Supreme Court affirmed that the treaty-making power could intrude on state confiscations of land, observing that “the common law in these particulars seems to coincide with theJus Gentium” on the question whether a property transfer in time of war was enforceable in time of peace.[195]",

The public utility approach discerns structural limits by asking whether a policy or business is affected with the public interest. When this public interest standard is met, all federal actors are authorized to enact policies that would otherwise interfere with private property rights. The social science approach subordinates questions of structure to the empirics of political science.",

Until we arrive at such a principle, separation of powers will remain fragmented and unpredictable. Of course, when we pick and choose among structural theories, we are often searching for evidence of liquidation. Yet over the long course of constitutional history, the reality is that when we choose one constitutional precedent, we create a mishmash of different theories, and in doing so, we discard other plausible options. When we do settle on a precedent, the act of analogizing it to the present often ignores the theoretical underpinnings of the doctrines we so routinely draw on in contemporary constitutional debates.",

In one sense, this is a deconstructive point. It is impossible to identify a historically correct doctrinal answer to contested structural questions—at least not without appealing to normative principles that allow one to pick among competing theories. In another sense, however, our heterodox structural traditions can reveal new modes of constitutional history. The common thread in the history of separation of powers is that judges, policymakers, and academics will revisit and reinvent constitutional doctrine and constitutional theory to fit the times.

Notably, in these episodes, constitutional actors were aware they were defending their separation-of-powers theories not with constitutional formalisms, but rather with claims about necessary updates to, for example, the Senate’s consensus view of political science.",

If the federal government were to take physical possession of a railroad, obviously it would be necessary under the Fifth Amendment to pay just compensation. If instead of taking possession it issued an order compelling the railroad to give the use of its property to the public free of charge, this would virtually be taking the property for public use without just compensation. If it allowed the railroad to receive compensation for its services, there would still be a question for the court whether, the compensation was just. It required, perhaps, a slight wrench to make a doctrine which required the government to pay just compensation, serve the purpose of requiring the government to permit the railroads to collect just compensation from their patrons; but the matter was never very minutely inquired into.”).",

We have called these separation-of-powers arguments “political science” theories because they reason through the separation-of-powers doctrine by asking which kinds of governance devices would most improve electoral politics, the functioning of state technocracies, and which would mitigate agency-cost and capture problems experienced by legislators. While we think the label is apt, we note that it is unusual to find evidence of a political science approach in this era of constitutional law. The period is often cast as having “dissolved into a number of tactical political positions with little coherence or consistency.” M.J.C. Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 289 (2d ed. 1998). And, indeed, this period is seen as the prelude to an account of the rise of political-science approaches in the Progressive era.See, e.g.,id.at 289–322 (describing the rise of political science in separation-of-powers theory as following “a demand for reform that built up through the Granger, Greenback, and Populist movements to its climax in Progressivism” and describing the emergence of administrative governance and a functionalist theory of separated powers as accepting the “multifunctionality of political structures”). The preoccupation of the actors in our story with politics is no less true of the Progressive Era, and focusing on what they took themselves to be doing suggests that they thought the separation of powers should be mobilized to pursue better government.",

Kagan likely has the better argument. Joseph Story’sCommentariesinterpreted Federalist 77’s reference to “dismissal” to refer plainly to removal.

Much of the current debate tries to parse the meaning of the Court’s statement that “there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which [C]ongress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.” Murray’s Lessee v.

But the special place for Article III adjudication, or at least adjudication before a judicial tribunal, appears to have been reserved for questions of constitutional right.SeeSmyth v. Ames,169 U.S. 466, 526 (1898) (“While rates for the transportation of persons and property within the limits of a state are primarily for its determination, the question whether they are so unreasonably low as to deprive the carrier of its property without such compensation as the constitution secures, and therefore without due process of law, cannot be so conclusively determined by the legislature of the state, or by regulations adopted under its authority, that the matter may not become the subject of judicial inquiry.”). Sometimes, publicness existed because the regulated entity was given a privilege, as occurred when it was given power to exercise eminent domain or a certificate of public convenience and necessity. But the grant of a government privilege was not dispositive. At other times, however, courts found that the entity had become affected with the public interest because it possessed market power or was important to the economy.",
