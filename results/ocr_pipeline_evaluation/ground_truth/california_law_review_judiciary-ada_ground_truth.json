      "text": "For over thirty years, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been the main federal protection against discrimination for disabled people. Although ADA protections are ensured in the federal legislative branch and in state courthouses, this pivotal disability rights statute does not cover the federal judiciary. ADA claims are consequently litigated in federal courthouses that may be inaccessible to disabled people, yet there is little scholarship on the topic. This Note aims to fill this gap by exploring the implications of the lack of accessibility in the federal judiciary. Without ADA protections, disabled people do not have recourse when faced with discrimination and inaccessible spaces. This lack of protection threatens disabled people’s access to justice, access to the workplace, and representation both on juries and within the federal judiciary. This Note consequently argues that the federal judiciary should adopt ADA protections to provide equal access to the federal court system and ensure that the federal judiciary reflects the diverse public it serves. It is time to have an informed conversation with all relevant constituencies about applying ADA protections to the federal judiciary.",

Federal judges have “great latitude” in applying the standards and definitions outlined in the ADA.[135]When applying ADA guidelines, federal judges evaluate who has a disability and what accommodations are reasonable, consequently serving as the “gatekeepers” of disability rights.[136]Additionally, a judge’s lived experience or lack thereof may impact their assessment of these cases,[137]as “[p]ersonal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see.”[138]For example, when examining Title VII cases,[139]studies have shown that having a primarily white, male environment can be harmful to plaintiffs, such as women or people of color, who bring harassment and discrimination cases.[140]Particularly during summary judgment and bench trials, where the judge rules without a jury, a judge may only have their experience and the experience of their clerks to draw from when evaluating cases.[141]If everyone in chambers is nondisabled, then cases are ruled on without a disabled perspective weighing in. Having a “diverse judiciary greatly shapes judicial decisionmaking, legal analysis, and, by extension, the law itself,” and it is thus critical that disabled people are included.[142]",

Although ADA protections are ensured in the federal legislative branch and in state courthouses, this pivotal disability rights statute does not cover the federal judiciary. ADA claims are consequently litigated in federal courthouses that may be inaccessible to disabled people, yet there is little scholarship on the topic. This Note aims to fill this gap by exploring the implications of the lack of accessibility in the federal judiciary. Without ADA protections, disabled people do not have recourse when faced with discrimination and inaccessible spaces. This lack of protection threatens disabled people’s access to justice, access to the workplace, and representation both on juries and within the federal judiciary. This Note consequently argues that the federal judiciary should adopt ADA protections to provide equal access to the federal court system and ensure that the federal judiciary reflects the diverse public it serves.

For example, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) does not apply to the judicial branch.[176]Exemption from FOIA, however, may protect an institution from harms that could arise from disclosure.[177]In the case of the federal court system, FOIA runs the risk of directly interfering with the judiciary’s decision-making process. Exemption from the ADA, on the other hand, does not protect the federal judiciary from harm, but instead harms the disabled people who interact with it. The exemption threatens the federal judiciary’s ability to “ensure that [it] is open and accessible, on a non-discriminatory basis, to all those who participate in the judicial process.”[178]",

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shift from entirely in-person dockets, as many courts adopted online proceedings in response to stay-at-home orders. This change increased people’s ability to access the courts remotely,[179]making it easier for disabled people to be court participants. Currently, while there is more remote access than in pre-pandemic times, the federal court system has decreased its remote access since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.[180]Nevertheless, the pandemic demanded accommodation and through this the federal judiciary demonstrated its ability to reimagine its functioning and accommodate limitations when needed.",
