Jackson Women’s Health Organization.[2]InMuñoz, the Court continued efforts, launched inDobbs, to shrink the protective force of the Due Process Clause. Even more significantly, inMuñoz, the Court launched another attack on the equality principle undergirdingLoving v. Virginia,[3]Lawrence v. Texas,[4]United States v. Windsor,[5]andObergefell v. Hodges.[6]Those cases embodied what Laurence Tribe once dubbed a “double helix” of due process and equal protection principles.[7]They show the Court’s effort (albeit imperfect) to weave together liberty guarantees and equality principles to better protect human dignity.[8]Muñozmade clear that the Court’s post-Dobbsreordering of constitutional principles is taking direct aim at both strands of the double helix. Through its rejection of substantive due process protections, the Court is intentionally weakening a broad swath of antidiscrimination protections and procedural due process rights.",

      "text": "This Essay explores the implications of theMuñozdecision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The Court took an unnecessarily maximalist approach inMuñoz, undermining the practical value of the right to marriage for individuals married to noncitizens. Part II argues that the Court did so through one of its frequently used moves: namely, denying rights protections to a U.S. resident (here, a citizen by birth and resident of California) through a sleight of hand that reducedMuñoz’s constitutional rights and interests to those of a constitutional “outsider.”[9]This aspect of the case foreshadows the continued erosion of constitutional protections for the members of historically subordinated groups. Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades of constitutional case law by denying courts a role in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court’s substantive due process analysis in Muñoz.[10]Invidious discrimination drove, and was manifested in, the Court’s reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent. Part V critiques the historical errors of the Court’s purportedly originalist account and its selected level of generality. The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications ofMuñozfor the Constitution’s promise of equal protection.Muñoz’s limited reading of the “right to marriage” obviously shrinks the protective scope of the Constitution’s due process protections. But in so doing, it also legitimates familiar patterns of subordination along lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, and citizenship.",

Because the law required him to travel to El Salvador to process his visa,[14]Asencio-Cordero also applied for and received from the Department of Homeland Security a waiver of the unlawful presence bar that would otherwise have prevented him from returning to the United States for ten years.[15]Armed with that waiver, he left the United States to complete his visa application process in El Salvador.[16]Unfortunately, when he then sought to return to the United States, the State Department’s consular officials working in the embassy in El Salvador denied his visa application.[17]In justifying the visa denial, the government offered no formal explanation beyond a citation to a statutory provision: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision bars the admission of a noncitizen whom the officer “knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in” certain specified offenses or “any other unlawful activity.”[18]",

He views the outcomes of these cases as consistent with other constitutional decisions of the time period that also tolerated comparable discrimination, rather than illustrative of an exceptional plenary immigration power.[40]Adam Cox has argued that the contemporary understanding of Congress’s immigration power as “plenary” is nowhere to be found in these early cases and is better understood as an invention of the Cold War era.[41]Deploying this broad, mid-twentieth-century notion of immigration plenary power, the Court has given Congress an unchecked ability to discriminate in ways that would be impermissible in almost all other areas of law.[42]",

Caseyalso reflect this notion.[104]More recently, in analyzing theObergefellmarriage equality decision, Laurence Tribe argued that “Obergefell’s chief jurisprudential achievement is to have tightly wound the double helix of Due Process and Equal Protection into a doctrine ofequal dignity—and to have located that doctrine in a tradition of constitutional interpretation as an exercise in public education.”[105]Both Yoshino and Tribe sawObergefell’s equal dignity principle as replacing the substantive due process inquiry outlined inGlucksberg, which bound the analysis to wooden interpretations of historic and traditional rights.[106]",

TheMuñozdecision gave pride of place to the approach inGlucksbergthat defines the claimed right at a very high level of specificity,[107]rejecting Muñoz’s fundamental rights claim through its narrow application of a history and tradition test founded upon a highly selective historical narrative.[108]In cases likeLawrence, and most certainly inObergefell, the Court was able to affirm substantive due process protections by setting a generous level of generality when defining the right in question. The level of generality at which the Court evaluated the right was key to the Court’s affirmation of substantive due process protection for the liberty of one consenting adult to engage in sexual activity with another.[109]The same was true of the Court’s decision recognizing the constitutional protection of same-sex marriage.[110]The majority opinion inMuñozseemingly closed the door on the capacious substantive due process analysis of these earlier cases.[111]And in failing to recognize that the facts of the case implicated any legal protections whatsoever for Muñoz’s marriage, the Court went even further, threatening every meaningful substantive and procedural protection that might otherwise have been thought to inhere in the marriage right.",

Yoshino attributed the Court’s reluctance to expand equal protection categories to “pluralism anxiety”—that is to say, the Court’s reluctant approach to equal protection emerged out of a concern that there were simply too many different groups that might claim the protection of heightened tiers of scrutiny.[112]Yoshino himself suggested that the tier stratifications of the equal protection doctrine carried both jurisprudential and political costs.[113]He therefore saw the liberty turn as a way for the Court to extend rights protections without reliance on identity categories, optimistically believing that it was “pluralism anxiety” rather than an “anti-antidiscrimination agenda”[114]that motivated the Court’s turn away from robust equal protection applications.[115]",

Siegel provides an overview of the longstanding academic and doctrinal debates—which she traces back to the beginning of the 1980s—over the selected level of generality. Originalists like Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia maintained that the selection of the correct, specific level of generality at which to define a particular fundamental right avoided arbitrary decision-making and operated as a constraint on judges.Id.at 591–95. In recent decades, the Court’s conservative justices largely have maintained a commitment to selecting the correct level of generality at which to define the right and continued to justify this analysis as a constraint on judicial discretion.See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 127 n.6 (1989) (opining that the Court needed to adopt “the most specific tradition as the point of reference” to avoid arbitrariness in judging); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (calling for a “careful description” of the asserted liberty interest); Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 257 (2022) (“Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s ‘concept of existence’ prove too much. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.”) (internal citation omitted). But, as Siegel notes, many academic originalists no longer maintain that the level of generality analysis constrains judicial decision-making, despite the fact that this was the initial justification for this analytic approach.

      "text": "This Essay explores the implications of theMuñozdecision. Part I summarizes the litigation and the resulting Supreme Court opinion. The Court took an unnecessarily maximalist approach inMuñoz, undermining the practical value of the right to marriage for individuals married to noncitizens. Part II argues that the Court did so through one of its frequently used moves: namely, denying rights protections to a U.S. resident (here, a citizen by birth and resident of California) through a sleight of hand that reducedMuñoz’s constitutional rights and interests to those of a constitutional “outsider.”[9]This aspect of the case foreshadows the continued erosion of constitutional protections for the members of historically subordinated groups. Part III explains how the decision rewrote five decades of constitutional case law by denying courts a role in reviewing immigrant admissions decisions of the political branches. Part IV excavates the racially discriminatory reasoning that implicitly undergirded the Court’s substantive due process analysis in Muñoz.[10]Invidious discrimination drove, and was manifested in, the Court’s reading of both founding-era history and its own precedent. Part V critiques the historical errors of the Court’s purportedly originalist account and its selected level of generality. The Essay concludes by highlighting the troubling implications ofMuñozfor the Constitution’s promise of equal protection.Muñoz’s limited reading of the “right to marriage” obviously shrinks the protective scope of the Constitution’s due process protections. But in so doing, it also legitimates familiar patterns of subordination along lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, and citizenship.",

Because the law required him to travel to El Salvador to process his visa,[14]Asencio-Cordero also applied for and received from the Department of Homeland Security a waiver of the unlawful presence bar that would otherwise have prevented him from returning to the United States for ten years.[15]Armed with that waiver, he left the United States to complete his visa application process in El Salvador.[16]Unfortunately, when he then sought to return to the United States, the State Department’s consular officials working in the embassy in El Salvador denied his visa application.[17]In justifying the visa denial, the government offered no formal explanation beyond a citation to a statutory provision: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision bars the admission of a noncitizen whom the officer “knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in” certain specified offenses or “any other unlawful activity.”[18]",

Siegel provides an overview of the longstanding academic and doctrinal debates—which she traces back to the beginning of the 1980s—over the selected level of generality. Originalists like Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia maintained that the selection of the correct, specific level of generality at which to define a particular fundamental right avoided arbitrary decision-making and operated as a constraint on judges.Id.at 591–95. In recent decades, the Court’s conservative justices largely have maintained a commitment to selecting the correct level of generality at which to define the right and continued to justify this analysis as a constraint on judicial discretion.See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 127 n.6 (1989) (opining that the Court needed to adopt “the most specific tradition as the point of reference” to avoid arbitrariness in judging); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (calling for a “careful description” of the asserted liberty interest); Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 257 (2022) (“Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s ‘concept of existence’ prove too much. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.”) (internal citation omitted). But, as Siegel notes, many academic originalists no longer maintain that the level of generality analysis constrains judicial decision-making, despite the fact that this was the initial justification for this analytic approach.
