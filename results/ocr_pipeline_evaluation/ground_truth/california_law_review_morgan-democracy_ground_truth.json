      "text": "California has a housing crisis. Despite the state government’s best efforts to build more homes, local governments and local voters are finding new ways to circumvent those requirements. One such loophole allows California voters to propose non-compliant housing plans through the ballot initiative process or effectively veto their local governments’ housing allocation decisions through a referendum. Although voters rarely use this loophole, the California Supreme Court should step in and prevent it from growing in popularity. The court can do so by simply making a small change to a legal test that determines when local initiatives and referenda are preempted by state law.",

A 2015 legislative report indicated that California might need to build 200,000 to 240,000 new homes to “seriously mitigate its problems with housing affordability.”[5]And while the exact amount of housing needed is “a moving target,” California is “nowhere close to closing” the gap between production and demand.[6]To close that gap, California passed a flurry of bills to encourage housing production.[7]Most importantly for this Note, the legislature enacted a number of statutes that limit the power of local governments to prevent or delay the construction of housing.[8]The state now requires every local government[9]to adopt a “general plan” that describes the municipality’s “development policies and objectives” relating to the urban environment.[10]General plans have a few constituent elements, one of which is the “housing element.”[11]Housing elements require cities to plan for a certain amount of housing.[12]Housing elements are also the subject of numerous high-profile political fights between the state and local governments, as California increasingly tries to “compel local governments to approve more housing.”[13]Even if local governments don’t resist, their voters sometimes act independently to stop new developments.[14]Housing element laws, as well as other pro-development policies, show that there is a clear and growing consensus from the state government that it disfavors localism in housing development and planning.",

      "text": "Although the courts have largely upheld the legislature’s efforts to set housing policy,[15]the judiciary is very protective of voters’ rights to exercise their direct democracy powers of initiative and referendum on planning issues.[16]This creates tension between the state government’s desire to increase housing and local electorates who wish to exercise their direct democracy powers to effectively veto state-mandated housing in their own backyards. Permitting these functional vetoes raises housing prices for everyone.[17]If the state legislature’s goal is indeed to preempt localism from blocking the development of new housing, then the local initiative and referendum powers provide a loophole through which voters can circumvent this goal. The slew of new housing bills from the state legislature show that it clearly prefers that housing planning be done at the regional and statewide levels, and that preference should be given judicial deference. Just as courts have allowed the state legislature to curb local governments’ power to plan for housing, they should revisit the precedent that allows local electorates to stall the implementation of housing mandates.",

The current preemption test, which the California Supreme Court articulated inCity of Morgan Hill, allows the state to impliedly preempt local direct democracy if (1) the state statute deals with a statewide concern and (2) there is a “definite indication” or “clear showing” that the legislature intended to preempt the initiative or referendum power.[18]That “definite indication” exists when either (a) the legislature has created a system of regulation so pervasive that the local government’s action is considered administrative or (b) the state’s legislative authority is delegated “exclusively to the local legislative body,” as shown by the statutory text.[19]To resolve the issue of local governments stalling development, all the California Supreme Court would have to do is combine both parts of the “definite indication“ prong into one comprehensive test. In essence, this means that the court should (1) look for a statewide concern and (2) consider the size and scope of the state regulation. This is not a particularly novel approach: The late California Supreme Court Justice Armand Arabian contemplated a more expansive exclusive delegation test while dissenting inDeVita v. County of Napa.[20]Following Justice Arabian’s model, my proposed test eliminates the administrative-legislative inquiry and instead incorporates a new procedural component into the exclusive delegation test.",

Hite, illustrates this concept.[46]InSimpson, the relevant state law required county boards of supervisors to provide “suitable quarters” for local courts.[47]Although the State set that overarching policy, the law gave boards of supervisors discretion to determine “what is required to constitute ‘suitable quarters.’”[48]In Los Angeles, the Board of Supervisors set a location for a courthouse, the planning commission affirmed it, and the county solicited bids.[49]At that point, disgruntled citizens started circulating an initiative petition to force the County to choose a different site for the courthouse.[50]The California Supreme Court removed the initiative from the ballot and held that the Board of Supervisors was acting as an administrative agent of the state.[51]The State had “acted to establish the basic policy” of creating suitable quarters for courthouses across the state and had “vested the responsibility for carrying out that policy” with the county boards of supervisors.[52]Thus, despite holding legislative power, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors was performing an administrative function “specifically imposed by the state.”[53]The court deemed this function beyond the scope of the people’s initiative power.[54]",

As mentioned above, when a petition with sufficient signatures is presented to a local legislative body, the legislative body can either adopt the amendment or put it to a vote.[146]The HCD review process requires the local planning agency to submit a draft to HCD prior to the adoption of the housing element, and the statute lists a number of measures to deal with noncompliance.[147]The Elections Code, by its terms, precludes HCD from reviewing drafts by limiting the legislative body’s options for responding to citizen petitions.[148]While such limitations generally help prevent the legislative body from circumventing the will of the people, in this specific instance, they deny legislative bodies the flexibility to adopt citizen-led housing element amendments and preclude election results from being contingent upon HCD review. Between the timing of housing element requirements and the HCD review process, the housing element adoption process and the local initiative process are procedurally incompatible.",

Hiteholding and rendered a formerly legislative act administrative.[155]The court rejected that argument, reasoning that the State only “sets minimum standards and policies” but that local legislative bodies have wide discretion to “determine the contents of its land use plans” and to “choose how to implement” those land use plans.[156]",

Permitting these functional vetoes raises housing prices for everyone.[17]If the state legislature’s goal is indeed to preempt localism from blocking the development of new housing, then the local initiative and referendum powers provide a loophole through which voters can circumvent this goal. The slew of new housing bills from the state legislature show that it clearly prefers that housing planning be done at the regional and statewide levels, and that preference should be given judicial deference. Just as courts have allowed the state legislature to curb local governments’ power to plan for housing, they should revisit the precedent that allows local electorates to stall the implementation of housing mandates.",

The current preemption test, which the California Supreme Court articulated inCity of Morgan Hill, allows the state to impliedly preempt local direct democracy if (1) the state statute deals with a statewide concern and (2) there is a “definite indication” or “clear showing” that the legislature intended to preempt the initiative or referendum power.[18]That “definite indication” exists when either (a) the legislature has created a system of regulation so pervasive that the local government’s action is considered administrative or (b) the state’s legislative authority is delegated “exclusively to the local legislative body,” as shown by the statutory text.[19]To resolve the issue of local governments stalling development, all the California Supreme Court would have to do is combine both parts of the “definite indication“ prong into one comprehensive test. In essence, this means that the court should (1) look for a statewide concern and (2) consider the size and scope of the state regulation.

Hite, illustrates this concept.[46]InSimpson, the relevant state law required county boards of supervisors to provide “suitable quarters” for local courts.[47]Although the State set that overarching policy, the law gave boards of supervisors discretion to determine “what is required to constitute ‘suitable quarters.’”[48]In Los Angeles, the Board of Supervisors set a location for a courthouse, the planning commission affirmed it, and the county solicited bids.[49]At that point, disgruntled citizens started circulating an initiative petition to force the County to choose a different site for the courthouse.[50]The California Supreme Court removed the initiative from the ballot and held that the Board of Supervisors was acting as an administrative agent of the state.[51]The State had “acted to establish the basic policy” of creating suitable quarters for courthouses across the state and had “vested the responsibility for carrying out that policy” with the county boards of supervisors.[52]Thus, despite holding legislative power, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors was performing an administrative function “specifically imposed by the state.”[53]The court deemed this function beyond the scope of the people’s initiative power.[54]",

Hiteby saying that, inSimpson, the only discretion in the hands of a local government was “the choice of a site” for a courthouse.[159]In contrast, local governments under the Coastal Act had discretion over what to build, so long as their decisions complied with the State’s “specific policies” outlined in the Coastal Act.[160]In the present case, the adoption of a housing element requires cities to plan for a specific amount of housing,[161]unlike the Coastal Act’s broad land use oversight.[162]The Coastal Act did not “dictate that a local government must build a hotel and conference center,”[163]but RHNA lawsdodictate that a local government must plan for a specific amount of housing.[164]Despite the factual similarities toYost, the adoption and amendment of a housing element fall into theSimpson v. Hitecategory because they both entail a legislative mandate to plan for a specific outcome, with cities afforded discretion only to choose site locations.[165]Under the administrative-legislative case law, the exercise of local referenda relating to housing elements would be preempted.",

And, under the holding inCity of Morgan Hill, a referendum rejecting a housing element is not the same as a noncompliant housing element; therefore, a referendum rejecting the housing element would be allowed.[167]The HCD review process also does not apply because a referendum rejecting a housing element does not trigger HCD review the way that an initiative would.",

Superior Court, the court worried that allowing referenda on administrative actions “would place municipal government in a straight-jacket and make it impossible for the city’s officers to carry on the public business.”[173]In other words, there are valid policy reasons to allow the state to preempt the local referendum power in order to implement its policy.
