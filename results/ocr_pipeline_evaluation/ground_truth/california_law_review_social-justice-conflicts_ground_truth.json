While the Supreme Court has increasingly inserted itself as the institutional arbiter of social justice claims, the Court’s assertion of its primacy to evaluate justice conflicts should be resisted on democratic and epistemic grounds. Instead, “democratic policymaking,” which occurs via Congress, the President, and administrative agencies, should be the primary site to resolve justice conflicts in our society.",

Currently, the mining, production, and use of coal accounts for 42 percent of revenue in the Navajo Nation’s General Fund.[3]The Navajo have also historically embraced their coal resources to promote their own sovereignty within the overarching colonial and capitalist structures they have been subjected to for most of America’s history.[4]Coal-related economic activity provides thousands of well-paying jobs for Navajo members living on or near their reservation,[5]which has a 48.5 percent unemployment rate.[6]Navajo political leaders argued that the new plant, called Desert Rock, would serve a vital role in stabilizing their economy given plans to phase out existing power plants in the coming decades.[7]",

Desert Rock was finally cancelled in March 2011.[11]The Navajo Nation, EPA, and environmental groups have continued to clash in recent years as the Navajo have sought to construct new pollution sources and upgrade existing sources related to their coal activities.[12]",

In philosophical literature, each of these justice claims, such as racial justice or environmental justice, is known as an “applied justice” claim because the claim of what a group is owed is restricted to a specific policy domain.[16]For example, environmental justice pertains to the demands of justice only within the domain of environmental policy. In recent years, scholars and activists have created a number of different types of various applied justice claims. It is now commonplace to see calls for racial, gender, reproductive, economic, labor, health, environmental, climate, energy, and disability justice, among other applied justice claims.[17]",

To make this argument, it identifies the conceptual category of “mid-level justice principles” within the concept of justice. Mid-level justice principles are trans-substantive principles of justice that provide standing reasons to justify certain policy outcomes. Mid-level justice principles are trans-substantive because they cover multiple policy areas (and are therefore broader than applied justice principles), but they do not fundamentally structure all justice claims in society (and are therefore narrower than basic justice principles).[42]The existence of mid-level justice principles is occasionally assumed in public law, but their properties have not been examined, nor have there been attempts to explicitly institutionalize them.[43]Examples of well-known principles in public law that are actually mid-level justice principles include procedural justice, anti-domination, capabilities theory, and restorative justice.[44]In fact, CBA itself is a mid-level justice principle. However, as currently structured, CBA suffers from multiple well-known shortcomings when policy issues involve normative values that resist quantification.[45]",

The first reason is to mitigate false negatives.

On Murray’s account, Justice Thomas did not include the voices of Black women regarding access to reproductive services and the structural barriers faced by women of color on reproductive decision-making matters.[126]These two considerations—centering the voices of Black women and considering structural barriers—are factors that should be included when examining applied justice claims of reproductive and racial justice regarding abortion.

This situation could lead to stark variability between which disadvantaged communities benefit from the initiative. In addition to the harms caused by such nontransparent interagency variability, this permissiveness of the Justice40 initiative regarding how agencies could define and prioritize disadvantaged communities could also create new justice conflicts. These new justice conflicts would be created, for example, if an agency is choosing between directing benefits towards a disadvantaged community whose economy previously relied on fossil fuel extraction (abandoned mine and at or below 65th percentile for the low-income factor for disadvantaged under the Justice40 screening tool) or a marginalized community whose air was polluted from such fossil fuel extraction (90th percentile for PM2.5 in the air and at/below 65th percentile for the low-income factor for disadvantaged under the Justice40 screening tool).[293]By taking such a permissive approach to defining disadvantaged communities for the sake of comprehensiveness, the Justice40 initiative did not provide any mechanism for agencies to mitigate justice conflicts. As a result, EOP-led initiatives are unlikely to be enough on their own to institutionalize mid-level justice principles.",

Courts are notoriously secretive while deciding cases.[407]At the Supreme Court, the only means of inter-institutional deliberation between the Court and other political institutions proceeds through the highly formalized means of the briefing and oral argument processes.[408]Extra-record deliberation is widely recognized as unethical due to the unfairness to the litigants before the Court.[409]Meanwhile, all of the diverse opinions and expertise of the various agencies and the President are channeled into the Office of the Solicitor General.[410]While congressional members can submit amici curiae briefs, other executive or administrative institutions are cut off from the Court’s deliberative process and the information flow is only one way—from these institutions to the Court. It is not surprising then that the Court often highly stylizes and simplifies the complexities of modern democratic policymaking and the role of each political institution in it.[411]As a result, judicial deliberation is not one that is meant to register the diverse perspectives and information from the various political institutions and interested parties involved in policymaking.",

For example, if a political institution has adopted multiple mid-level justice principles and they point to different outcomes in a specific justice conflict, then this situation can be resolved in at least two different ways. First, the institution could adopt a lexical prioritization of adopted mid-level justice principles. Importantly, a prioritization among mid-level justice principles does not require a basic justice principle given that mid-level justice principles can vacillate in their specificity—a more abstract mid-level justice principle could resolve a conflict between two more specified mid-level justice principles. Alternatively, the balancing of these mid-level justice principles may differ based upon the unique factual considerations present in the specific justice conflict at issue.SeeJeremy Waldron,Superseding Historic Injustice, 103 Ethics 4 (1992); Bayles,supranote 43, at 59.",

Initially, many states set the net metering rate at the full retail rate as an incentive for individuals to add solar panels.

The strength of these arguments is heightened when the policy issue pertains to social justice. This occurs because of the theoretical centrality of social justice to democratic politics[396]and the increased political salience of social justice matters to the citizenry maximize the likelihood for extensive citizen attention and participation during policymaking.[397]Simply put, democratic policymaking is how we, as a political community, select between competing social justice claims and instill our chosen conception of social justice across our society.[398]",

For discussion of some of these debates, compare Young,supranote 73, at 15–65 (critiquing conceptions of justice that are purely distributional or individual in nature and instead advocating for a conception of justice concerned with material distribution, individual capacities, and group cooperation), with Bruce Ackerman, Social Justice in the Liberal State 24–26 (1982) (defending a liberal conception of justice that is primarily material, distributional, and individual).

Importantly, a prioritization among mid-level justice principles does not require a basic justice principle given that mid-level justice principles can vacillate in their specificity—a more abstract mid-level justice principle could resolve a conflict between two more specified mid-level justice principles.
