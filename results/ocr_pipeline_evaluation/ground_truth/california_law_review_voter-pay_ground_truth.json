      "text": "This Note explores the idea of paying Americans to cast their ballots as a mechanism to increase electoral participation among lower income voters and rebalance the influence that wealthy Americans have on policy outcomes. The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials’ perception of the “median voter” away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",

For example, when was the last time you voted? How far could you stretch that $20? Would you get the money today, in two weeks, or in six months? Would it be illegal for you to accept the money, or for me to give it to you? Unfortunately for you, the answer to that last pair of questions is “yes.” But what if instead, thegovernmentoffered you $20 for casting a ballot?

Seeing new activity from historically low-propensity voters, campaigns and lawmakers behind those campaigns would turn their organizing efforts, policy proposals, and attention away from the wealthy and towards the lower-income and underrepresented segments of the electorate.",

For example, many states and cities match small-dollar contributions from a voter to a candidate for office, thus increasing the effective value of small-dollar donations.[23]Other cities, like Oakland and Seattle, have enacted voucher programs whereby every voter can receive—and then donate—a certain dollar amount (say $100) to the campaign of their choice.[24]Instead of capping the ability of the wealthy to donate, level-up policies seek to bring new donors into the system.[25]",

      "text": "Level-up thinking is highly relevant to a voter incentive program. The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in cities and states that have significantly reduced barriers to voting. Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for small-dollar donors.[26]Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors.[27]Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result in greater progress towards achieving a representative electorate and ultimately addressing democratic imbalance. A great policy proposal that leverages this type of level-up thinking to address electoral imbalance is the Mobilization Matching Fund, proposed by Professor Bertrall Ross II.[28]This policy would use federal dollars to match campaign expenditures used to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent electoral participation, commonly referred to as “low-propensity voters.”[29]",

Voucher programs, matching fund programs, and the Mobilization Matching Fund all require involvement from a third party: the campaign apparatus. By contrast, a voter incentive program does not rely on any engagement between a campaign and a voter. Instead, the government would cut out the middleman and incentivize turnout by paying the voter directly. There could be numerous benefits from this approach. For example, removing the campaign as an intermediary could reduce transaction costs, thereby lowering the overall budget constraints of the program. Voters may also be more trustful of a program that does not rely on a political middleman, and instead rewards them directly for making their own, informed decision.",

For example, higher participation may lead to less conflict, higher quality public services, and greater governmental expertise.[31]Inequality in health outcomes may fall as the turnout gap between high and low educated citizens shrinks.[32]Many have argued that as political participation increases among low-income populations, political systems become more responsive to rising levels of inequality.[33]In the United States, some expect that increasing participation will ease polarization,[34]lift faith in government, and make policy outcomes more responsive to all segments of the socio-economic ladder.[35]",

A positive externality is “a consequence or side effect of one’s economic activity” that “benefits” an individual or individuals other than the person engaging in the economic activity.[43]These spillover benefits are “external” because at scale they accrue to society’s benefit; the individual voter does not realize the benefit upon casting their vote.[44]In a theoretical exploration of positive externalities and voting, Stefan Krasa and Mattias Polborn have described this phenomenon as follows: Assume two candidates,AandB, are running for office. About 60 percent of the population supports CandidateA, but, in a hypothetical match-up, CandidateAwins by only one vote. Many of CandidateA’s supporters stayed home. Those who turned out to vote for CandidateAimpose a positive externality on society by electing the general population’s preferred candidate.[45]",

Thus, the immediate benefit that Jane derives from voting is quite low. Jane will consider the costs of voting—driving to the polls, waiting in line, missing work—and may decide to stay home.[46]If, say, Jane’s family and friends make the same decision, participation will fall, and CandidateBmight win.

Consider two individuals: One is a cashier who makes $15 per hour, and the other is an attorney who makes $150 per hour. A twenty-dollar incentive to vote makes taking the time off work more economically advantageous for the restaurant worker, but it will barely move the needle for the attorney.

As discussed in Part II.B, a $20 subsidy to the voter may internalize the positive externalities of voting at the individual level.

For example, in New York, the Democratic Party controlled forty-five of the fifty-one city council seats following the 2023 election.[95]There, voters may associate a policy with the Democratic Party, whose officials may in turn use that association to further entrench their power.

Though voters may elect a specific party to strengthen or reform programs like Medicare or Social Security, it is unlikely that the electorate gives the incumbent credit for Social Security benefits or Medicare benefits, given that the programs have been around for many decades.

Assuming that local governments can surmount such challenges, providing a direct subsidy would likely be the best way to achieve the goals of a voter incentive program.",

Thus, one potential solution to the high cost of this program is to provide an incentive to vote only in certain types of elections. For example, a city may opt to provide the benefit only in general elections and not primary elections[247]or in less frequent mayoral elections but not in more frequent city council races.",

By that I mean, governments could incentivize only first-time voters or incentivize voters the first three times they vote. Not only would this save on costs, but it would also help to address concerns raised in Part II.C.2 that a program of this nature would essentially become a recurring handout to more affluent voters who do not need an incentive to cast a ballot. Further, studies have shown that once an individual casts a ballot in one election, their propensity to vote again in the future increases.[248]Thus, to appreciate the benefits of greater turnout, it might be sufficient to incentivize voting up to the point at which casting a ballot becomes a habit. That said, there are also risks to providing nonuniversal benefits, namely that segments of the populace who do not receive the benefit may begin to view the subsidy as a form of entitlement program. As the thinking around a voter incentive program grows and evolves, this is an area that ultimately merits further study.",

I maintain that this policy is fully constitutional and does not burden any fundamental right.[250]But on the off chance that a court does find this policy burdens a right not to vote, that court will eventually proceed to a tailoring analysis in which, depending on the level of scrutiny, the policy must be tailored to meet the government’s interest. If the government’s interest is in increasing participation, then its focus is getting people to the polls, regardless of how they vote. Allowing an option not to vote tailors the policy to that interest. Moreover, for a non-voter who stays home out of protest, an option not to vote arguably makes their message of protest more concentrated and salient.[251]Under the current system, people stay home for an untold number of reasons, but casting a blank ballot sends a much clearer protest message. Thus, including a “no vote” option brings more voices into the system and offers voters greater choice.",

I assumed that such a policy would be illegal, and if it were not, paying people to do what many of us consider a civic duty struck me as something that might degrade the collective value that Americans place on democratic participation. But then I considered the reality of the participatory landscape. Many people simply do not vote. Non-voting contributes to an economically imbalanced electorate, which in turn skews policy outcomes. This trend is even more pronounced in local elections, elections that have the most direct impact on our daily lives. And in states like California that have reduced nearly every barrier to voting, many still choose not to vote. Perhaps an extra nudge might do the trick.",

Much of my analysis only scratches the surface, and there is so much more work that can be done on this idea. I have demonstrated that a voter incentive program would likely pass statutory and constitutional muster. And with the right policy design—such as starting local and providing direct, visible, and infrequent incentives—a voter incentive policy might in fact bring new voters to the polls. All that remains is whether it is worth the time and the financial and political capital it would take for policymakers to take up such a proposal.",

This vastly overstates the Fifth Circuit’s treatment of the issue. InBeare v. Smith, the district court stated, “At the outset, it must be said that the right to vote is a right which is at the heart of our system of government. Parenthetically, it must be said that there is also a right not to vote.” 321 F. Supp. at 1102–03 (S.D. Tex. 1971). That was the extent of the district court’s treatment of the issue. Indeed, this statement assumes that, rather than explains why, a right not to vote is a corollary of the right to vote. In affirming the district court’s opinion, the Fifth Circuit held that Texas’s “statutory provisions requiring annual voter registration during a restricted four-month period” burdened the fundamentalright to vote.

The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials’ perception of the “median voter” away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy.",

For example, many states and cities match small-dollar contributions from a voter to a candidate for office, thus increasing the effective value of small-dollar donations.[23]Other cities, like Oakland and Seattle, have enacted voucher programs whereby every voter can receive—and then donate—a certain dollar amount (say $100) to the campaign of their choice.[24]Instead of capping the ability of the wealthy to donate, level-up policies seek to bring new donors into the system.[25]",

      "text": "Level-up thinking is highly relevant to a voter incentive program. The current approach to electoral imbalance often focuses on reducing barriers to entry. For example, automatic or same-day voter registration removes the hurdle of pre-registration, and vote-by-mail eliminates the need to travel to a polling location. Though barrier elimination is critical to electoral rebalancing, level-up thinking indicates that such efforts are necessary but not sufficient. If barrier reduction alone were sufficient, participation rates would likely be much higher in cities and states that have significantly reduced barriers to voting. Indeed, platforms like ActBlue and WinRed have removed barriers to entry for small-dollar donors.[26]Yet, small-dollar matching programs have gone one step further by leveraging incentives to draw in a new and diverse set of donors.[27]Thus, leveraging the logic of level-up policy to bring in new or infrequent voters may result in greater progress towards achieving a representative electorate and ultimately addressing democratic imbalance. A great policy proposal that leverages this type of level-up thinking to address electoral imbalance is the Mobilization Matching Fund, proposed by Professor Bertrall Ross II.[28]This policy would use federal dollars to match campaign expenditures used to mobilize voters. For example, if a campaign spends $10,000 to mobilize voters, the government would send the campaign another $10,000 to spend on additional mobilization efforts. Ross recommends that the government consider requiring campaigns to target specific types of voters, such as voters with a history of infrequent electoral participation, commonly referred to as “low-propensity voters.”[29]",

By contrast, a voter incentive program does not rely on any engagement between a campaign and a voter. Instead, the government would cut out the middleman and incentivize turnout by paying the voter directly. There could be numerous benefits from this approach. For example, removing the campaign as an intermediary could reduce transaction costs, thereby lowering the overall budget constraints of the program.

At the individual level, voting is how we voice our opinion to the government, advocate for change, and elect those who represent our values. At the societal level, several studies have shown a positive correlation between participation levels and beneficial policy outcomes. For example, higher participation may lead to less conflict, higher quality public services, and greater governmental expertise.[31]Inequality in health outcomes may fall as the turnout gap between high and low educated citizens shrinks.[32]Many have argued that as political participation increases among low-income populations, political systems become more responsive to rising levels of inequality.[33]In the United States, some expect that increasing participation will ease polarization,[34]lift faith in government, and make policy outcomes more responsive to all segments of the socio-economic ladder.[35]",

First, voting may suffer from a positive externality problem. A positive externality is “a consequence or side effect of one’s economic activity” that “benefits” an individual or individuals other than the person engaging in the economic activity.[43]These spillover benefits are “external” because at scale they accrue to society’s benefit; the individual voter does not realize the benefit upon casting their vote.[44]In a theoretical exploration of positive externalities and voting, Stefan Krasa and Mattias Polborn have described this phenomenon as follows: Assume two candidates,AandB, are running for office. About 60 percent of the population supports CandidateA, but, in a hypothetical match-up, CandidateAwins by only one vote. Many of CandidateA’s supporters stayed home. Those who turned out to vote for CandidateAimpose a positive externality on society by electing the general population’s preferred candidate.[45]",

Thus, the immediate benefit that Jane derives from voting is quite low. Jane will consider the costs of voting—driving to the polls, waiting in line, missing work—and may decide to stay home.[46]If, say, Jane’s family and friends make the same decision, participation will fall, and CandidateBmight win. Economists refer to this phenomenon as “market failure”—that is, a market producing a good below its socially optimal level.[47]Market failure is often a justification for government intervention.[48]",

Consider two individuals: One is a cashier who makes $15 per hour, and the other is an attorney who makes $150 per hour. A twenty-dollar incentive to vote makes taking the time off work more economically advantageous for the restaurant worker, but it will barely move the needle for the attorney.

For the sake of argument, assume that both voting and non-voting are forms of expressive conduct under the First Amendment.

Several cities across the country have implemented programs that seek to democratize campaign finance.[219]For example, Seattle has a “democracy voucher” program that gives voters vouchers they can donate to a campaign.[220]Although this program addresses unequal financial participation in campaign contributions, it likely has a knock-on effect of increased voter participation. Researchers could conduct comparative empirical analyses that compare the effects that such programs have on voter turnout, or even electoral balancing, as compared to a voter incentive program. Studying this at the purely local level will also help researchers control for confounding variables to truly isolate the effect that a small-dollar payment has on a voter’s decision to vote. For example, in a mixed election that uses a voter incentive program, a voter who would not otherwise vote in a purely local election may show up to vote for a state or federal candidate. Thus, teasing out the causal impact of a voter incentive program may be easier at the local level, where fewer variables weigh on a voter’s decision to vote. In turn, advocates can begin to understand which policies best increase turnout and target their efforts accordingly.",

A local government can test new approaches to the policy, from adjusting its dollar amount to its frequency and then study the impacts of the change on voter turnout. As local officials learn and refine, they can provide valuable insights for policy makers in other localities or states.

Now assume that Pima County, andonlyPima County, implemented a voter incentive policy for all localandstate-wide elections. In Pima County, 38 percent of voters are registered Democrats compared to 27.6 percent Republicans,[223]and in 2020, about 60 percent of Pima County voters cast a ballot for Mayes.[224]A policy that increases voter turnout in only one county could swing a state-wide election with such thin margins.[225]To ensure that this policy does not have unintended spillover effects on other levels of government, incentives must be made available to every voter in a given election. This could certainly happen at the state-wide level, but for reasons detailed in the paragraph above, I assume this would be an easier feat at the local level.

Every level of government, from the federal government to the county, offers some form of tax credit. For example, the federal government, California, and San Francisco all offer their own version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program the government operates through the tax code to the benefit of low-income working families.[228]A clear benefit of implementing a voter benefit program through the tax code is that governments possess the infrastructure to implement such a program. Indeed, a state could easily implement a voter incentive program by doing little more than including a new line-item on a voter’s tax form.[229]Should policymakers implement the program as a refundable tax credit, the government could leverage an individual’s direct deposit information to send them the incentive quickly and efficiently.[230]",

This policy benefitted nearly 97 percent of Americans to the tune of roughly $1,200 per person over the course of a year.[233]Instead of a lump-sum, stand-alone payment, the policy paid out in small amounts as part of Americans’ monthly paycheck. Fewer than 10 percent of those polled had any clue that the policy existed.[234]By contrast, in 2020 Congress passed emergency pandemic relief that included stand-alone, direct payments of between $600 and $1,400 to about 90 percent of taxpayers.[235]Surveys showed that Americans were aware this money had hit their bank accounts, and they used it for its intended purpose: to buy food, household products, and pay for rent and utilities.[236]",

Submerged policies like tax credits fall prey to this danger because they lack immediacy. By contrast, when an individual receives a direct benefit, like food stamps or unemployment insurance, they perceive the immediate benefit of that program; as soon as funds appear in a bank account or on an EBT card, the holder can spend that money immediately.[237]To maximize turnout, an optimal voter incentive program will make its benefits as visible as possible to voters as close to the moment that they cast their ballot as possible.",

A direct-deposit system could be particularly challenging to implement if a division like a county registrar’s office runs the program. The registrar would need to acquire a voter’s banking information and then set up a payment system. By contrast, registrar offices do have every voter’s address; thus, mailing checks may be more straightforward for local elections officials. Further, in line with Mettler’s preference for highly visible policy, mailing a check would do more to avoid the problems of submerged policy.

Following that, the government must ensure each check makes it to the right household. In 2020 and 2021, the IRS and Treasury issued over $900 billion in direct payments to individuals as part of COVID-19 stimulus programs; in doing so the government ran into a lot of problems, including improper payments and getting funds to first-time tax filers and those experiencing homelessness.[243]Cities have developed tools to serve unhoused populations,[244]low-income tax filers,[245]and other hard-to-reach communities,[246]but if a highly resourced federal agency like the IRS faced challenges operationalizing a direct payment program, local governments might as well.

Further, studies have shown that once an individual casts a ballot in one election, their propensity to vote again in the future increases.[248]Thus, to appreciate the benefits of greater turnout, it might be sufficient to incentivize voting up to the point at which casting a ballot becomes a habit.

Allowing an option not to vote tailors the policy to that interest.
