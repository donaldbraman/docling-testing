Yet many law school curriculums still focus on the law as it exists in the moment, and deemphasize that the law, the practice of law, and possibly even society as a whole will change in the decades to come.",

Law schools have the opportunity to subtly shift the way students relate to the law by broadening the approach to encouraging flexibility and resilience. This in turn has real potential to increase future student success,and increase the longevity of law schools in these evolving times as well.",

The good news is that law schools do not have to figure this out alone: there is already extensive research on ways schools can evolve to increase their students’ readiness for unpredictable challenges and critical thinking skills.",

Keeping up with constantly evolving bar rules, business trends, technological developments, and unpredictable future needs is more than what current faculties are equipped for, and a massive challenge in already challenging times. Future success will require higher levels of understanding of evolving technology, business economics, political forecasting, and pedagogical techniques than any one law professor or small faculty group can achieve alone.",

Research indicates the opposite: increased resilience is easier in communal environments with strong social support.The traditional approach to ethics in law school has tended to encourage students to operate in silos, something that must be rapidly unlearned when they enter the practice of law.While the curved nature of law school assessments means that every course must have a heavily-weighted individual assessment component, finding more ways to incorporate partnered and grouped exercises will help students understand that individual success can be enhanced with group collaboration in a rapidly changing world. By fostering a collaborative mindset early in the careers of future lawyers, law schools can help prepare students to tackle the interconnected challenges of the future with increased creativity, innovation, and confidence.",

In addition, most law students (and most law professors) have traditionally preferred the well-worn path of least resistance towards a destination bestowed with honors indicating inevitable success.Unfortunately, the twin tornadoes of generative AI and climate change mean that many well-worn paths of certainty and stability have been taken over by the raging wildfires of societal change. So when law students come to administrators with inevitable complaints about new teaching ways, law schools will need to resist the temptation to offer false reassurances. Instead law school communities can embrace the opportunity to practice what they preach and remind students they are preparing them for the volatility of the future by teaching them to approach inevitable challenges with adaptability and resilience.",

The American Bar Association is already encouraging law schools to foster discussions about bias and societal challenges,and law professors can reinforce overall societal resilience by embracing change as an opportunity to challenge students to consider how cultural change cultivates the growth of tough issues. It is well-documented that many of today’s law students will go on to become tomorrow’s leaders of society.By teaching students that changes are not just challenges but instead opportunities, law professors can plant early seeds to help prepare law students to navigate the complexities of the future with resilience, integrity, and compassion.",
