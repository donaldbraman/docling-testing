Roth,“[p]roperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.”Professor Stewart Sterk traces this reliance on state law (as opposed to general law) as far back asPennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon— the first case to recognize a regulatory taking.Pennsylvania Coal, Sterk argues, emphasized state law’s importance for regulatory takings analysis by identifying specific property interests enshrined in state common law and legislation.And by the late twentieth century, the Supreme Court routinely relied on state law to define property rights in cases challenging actions by state governments.By “defer[ring] to state-specific property principles,” federal courts upheld property federalism and the accompanying “belief that property is an inherently local matter and that different states might opt to recognize and regulate property interests differently.”",

Levels of Generality. —BakerandSlaybaughillustrate that the general law approach, because it is fundamentally an exercise in abstraction, can result in more expansive background limitations on property rights (and therefore less property protection). A familiar theme in constitutional law is that as a principle’s level of generality increases, so too do the number of particular cases that it covers.In the background principles context, increased abstraction can mean more limitations on property interests and less Takings Clause protection. That general law background principles would be more abstract than state-specific ones is intuitive: When courts attempt to analyze the laws of jurisdictions in times and places near and far, a higher level of generality is needed to make those disparate laws all cognizable as part of a single, all-encompassing background principle. InBaker, for example, the necessity exception was distilled into a highly general rule that left the meaning of “emergency” and “necessity” — the principle’s two key terms — ambiguous.But these words’ content can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.",

Perhaps it stems naturally from the fact that background principles are antecedent to the takings analysis, such that the burden falls on the plaintiff to establish that they had a property interest in the first place. More cynically, it could be the result of the courts’ squeamishness toward making definitive statements about history in these cases, so as to preserve “flexibility” for future cases,conceal operative normative judgments,or avoid getting the answer wrong.On this understanding, background rules would only appear categorical, but judges would exercise discretion in individual cases to determine whether a plaintiff’s showing of history is “close enough.” In any case, by burdening plaintiffs to disprove the applicability of background limitations — instead of requiring the government to prove a necessity defense — these early general law cases demonstrate a bias that undercuts property protections.",
