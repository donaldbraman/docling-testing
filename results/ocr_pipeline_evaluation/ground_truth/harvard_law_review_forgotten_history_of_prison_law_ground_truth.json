      "text": "Prison law is characterized by judicial deference to penal administrators. Despite the well-documented horrors that occur behind prison walls, federal and state courts often decline to intervene, asserting, among other things, that prisoners’ rights are limited and that the judicial branch lacks the power and expertise to get involved in the inner workings of detention facilities. Moreover, jurists often assume that the nation’s first courts largely stayed out of prisons and jails, and contemporary judicial deference is therefore historically rooted. This Article complicates that historical narrative. It shows that the nation’s Founding generation established an expansive system of judicial oversight over prisons and jails that lasted through much of the nineteenth century. During that period, state and local judges across the fledgling republic conducted regular inspections of detention facilities; set prison and jail rules and policies; appointed, removed, and occasionally served as penal administrators; managed the funding and building of jail facilities; and remedied abuses. On occasion, federal courts also interceded on behalf of prisoners. Relying on neglected state statutes, case law, and reports, as well as the writings of prison theorists and observers, this Article explores the oft-ignored history of American prison law. In so doing, this Article shows how far modern courts have diverged from their early predecessors, especially at the state and local levels. For jurists — and particularly originalists — who use history to inform contemporary doctrine, this Article provides a fuller account of the early relationship between courts and prisons. Finally, this Article reveals a model of judicial oversight from which scholars and advocates can learn.",

They also investigated complaints and remedied abuses in prisons and jails; enacted rules, policies, and practices for carceral settings; appointed, approved, removed, and sometimes even served as penal authorities; and oversaw the financing, building, and repair of detention facilities.These responsibilities were, according to some of the most influential penal reform theorists and advocates of the era, essential to a humane and effective carceral system.",

      "text": "Today, the relationship between courts and prisons looks dramatically different. Modern courts — including local, state, and federal courts — largely stay out of the workings of prisons and jails.Without litigation, courts have little to no authority to intervene behind prison and jail walls. And in the course of litigation, jurists grant a high degree of deference to prison administrators.The result is that courts are often unable or unwilling to intervene on behalf of prisoners,despite the fact that, as one scholar recently put it, prisons regularly “fail to provide even minimally safe and healthy living conditions.”",

Jurists regularly suggest that early prisoners were considered “slaves of the State” who lacked the opportunity to seek redress in court.Further, jurists assert that early courts largely stayed out of detention settings due to concerns about the separation of powers.Sometimes, this history merely serves as a backdrop for deference today.But other times, and especially for jurists with originalist leanings, this purported history seems to be a justification for modern-day restraint.As one current Supreme Court Justice wrote, interfering in prison administration would be improper because it would constitute a “refusal — for the first time ever — to defer to the expert judgment of prison officials.”",

I also searched through compilations of nineteenth-century case law on prison conditions. Finding that eighteenth- and nineteenth-century courts were heavily involved in the administration of prison and jail systems and hoping to better understand the origins of that involvement, I looked to the writings of early prison theorists. Ultimately, this process revealed a robust system of judicial power over detention facilities during the nation’s Founding era and for much of the century that followed. This Article resurfaces some of that history for the first time.",

Specifically, this Article casts doubt on the narrative that there existed widespread judicial deference in the nation’s early years that justifies deference by nearly all courts today. Because early state courts were particularly involved in prison and jail administration, originalist justifications for deference by state courts are especially susceptible to reevaluation — an important conclusion given the increasing focus on state litigation among prison advocates and scholars.But early federal courts also interceded on behalf of prisoners, thereby weakening originalist justifications at the federal level, too.",

Specifically, it explains how deference has made its way into substantive standards governing prisoners’ constitutional rights as well as standards for judicial remedies behind bars. This Part also details how judges, and especially originalists, sometimes attempt to root their explanations for deference in historical accounts of the relationship between courts and prisons. Part II details the role that courts played in prisons and jails in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This Part begins with the theoretical foundation for judicial oversight devised by reformers in the eighteenth century. It then describes the constitutional and common law rights recognized by early federal and state courts. Next, it delves into the wide array of statutorily authorized oversight responsibilities held by state and local courts. Part II concludes with an account of the disempowerment of the judiciary over the course of the nineteenth century. Part III turns to this Article’s implications. It describes how the relationship between courts and prisons has changed since the nation’s first years and the ways that the historical relationship might bear on contemporary prison doctrine. Part III also provides insight into some potential reasons and models for increased judicial oversight over prisons and jails outside of litigation.",

But should they learn of one more feature — the gaping absence of judicial oversight — they might understand how all the rest came to be. Indeed, the Founding generation and those that followed believed that the judiciary served as an essential guardrail against the kind of cruel and ineffective penal system they feared. The modern era may have proved them right.",

Similarly, by “prison law,” I refer to law related to both prisons and jails, including both pre- and postconviction detention. The law does not usually distinguish between the former (prisons and jails), but it does sometimes distinguish between the latter (pre- and postconviction detention). Nevertheless, both pre- and postconviction law center judicial deference and have developed based on much of the same reasoning.CompareShaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 228 (2001) (centering judicial deference in the postconviction context),withBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 & n.29 (1979) (citing Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Lab. Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 126, 129 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 826–27 (1974); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404–05, 412–14 (1974)) (centering judicial deference in the preconviction context),andFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318, 326–28 (2012) (citing Turner v.
