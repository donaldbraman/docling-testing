      "text": "Every year, police perform searches governed by the Fourth Amendment on hundreds of thousands of individuals and their property throughout the United States. Many of the academy’s most decorated scholars have focused on the genesis and jurisprudential nature of the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. Surprisingly, we know almost nothing about how the Fourth Amendment regulates searches and how searches actually work in practice. In this Article, we pull back the curtain on the search and seizure process by presenting the largest quantitative study of warrants of any kind. We analyze over 33,000 warrant applications filed through Utah’s “e-Warrants” system over a three-year period. By utilizing the full texts of the warrant affidavits, along with digital timestamp metadata, we categorize warrants by type, length, and complexity and establish when and for how long judges review warrants. Our key findings demonstrate that the warrant review process is fast and nearly always results in approval. Ninety-eight percent of warrant reviews eventually result in an approval, and over 93% are approved on first submission. Further, we find that the median time for review is only three minutes, and that one out of every ten warrants is opened, reviewed, and approved in sixty seconds or less. Our analyses that account for warrant complexity and length also suggest that many approved warrants are either not read carefully or not read in full (or both). We also perform a qualitative analysis of a randomly selected subsample of warrants and find cases where the review process has clearly failed. Taken together, our results have critical implications regarding the warrant review process that force us to reconsider the constitutional nature of probable cause and the role that judicial review plays as a “check” on police searches. In light of these implications, we explore the political, economic, and logistical constraints that judges face when reviewing warrants and consider pathways to reform that are mindful of these factors.",

Indeed, subsequent investigations into both incidents showed that the submitting officers perjured themselves and the reviewing judges (or magistrates) approved the no-knock warrants when they were questionable at best— the precise kinds of behavior that constitutionally prescribed judicial review of warrants is designed to curb.",

These stories also urge review and reconsideration of search warrants more broadly. Between 2010 and 2016, at least eighty-one civilians and thirteen officers died in “dynamic entry” raids including no-knock raids.More commonly, serious injuries and property damage result from searches, requiring millions of dollars of litigation costs and payouts from police departments.Even if no death, injury, or property damage results from a warrant, nearly all warrant-based searches impose substantial privacy costs, as officers enter homes, search and detain individuals, and examine digital items like cell phones and computers that contain troves of particularly personal information. And ignoring the individualized costs, the invasiveness of searches inevitably undermines trust in law enforcement, especially in overpoliced, marginalized communities.",

Consistent with the constitutional requirements in the Fourth Amendment, we know that neutral judges are required in warrant review, but what role do these judgesactuallyplay in such a determination — that is, how are such decisions made in practice, and to what extent do judges actually function as a “neutral and detached” check against “officer[s] engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime?”Are the failures demonstrated in the Breonna Taylor and Amir Locke events tragic but unavoidably random anecdotes, or are they the product of systematic institutional failures? And how do the answers to these questions color our understanding of the extent to which a warrant requirement truly matters at all? Finally, do these searches actually work in practice?",

      "text": "But while the national appetite for warrant reform has arguably never been higher, actual data on warrants is incredibly scarce. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only four empirical studies on the warrant application and review process conducted in the last forty-five years.Three of these were done prior to the arrival of smartphones and the broad proliferation of electronic warrants, and all of them relied on relatively limited datasets. In his 2012 study, Professor Thomas Miles investigated the propensity for “judge shopping”in all wiretap warrant submissions to federal judges from 1997–2007, looking specifically to see whether judges with certain ideological leanings, professional backgrounds, or racial/ethnic identities were more likely to receive warrant applications.The seminal 1985 study by Richard Van Duizend and others observed eighty-four warrant proceedings and found that 65% of the warrant applications were decided in around two-and-a-half minutes or less, with a median time of two minutes and twelve seconds.The reports stemming from the San Diego Search Warrant Study were similarly discouraging, finding probable cause violations and racial disparities among nearly 250 drug-related search warrants issued in 1998.More recently, theSalt Lake Tribuneevaluated a smaller and more limited version of the dataset we utilized in this Article (their exposé was the inspiration for our study), analyzing 844 warrants approved in Utah over the course of one month in 2017.The report accused the judiciary of being “too hasty” with warrant review and sometimes even “rubber stamping” approvals when the content of the affidavit did not meet probable cause standards.",

      "text": "Most of these studies raised concerns about the speed at which warrants were reviewed and the high rates at which they were approved, questioning whether “the suppositions regarding the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement may not be borne out in practice.”However, relying on the conclusions drawn from such small samples (and old data) may paint a picture that is incomplete and potentially misleading. Context is important, and some may argue that the inherently hurried environment in which warrants are sought, combined with the low standard of review, creates a system in which swift reviews and approvals are expected, necessary, and, ultimately, adequate. Similarly, warrant affidavits are short and only require the officer to establish a reasonable basis for believing that evidence for a crime exists,so the necessary time for review might be less than critics believe. Furthermore, judges, especially state trial-level judges, often are underresourced, face a growing backlog of potentially more critical matters, and may be incentivized to maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement.",

Even more, the dataset includes metadata captured by the e-Warrants system that chronicles the timing of every important stage of the warrant review process, including when the officer submits the warrant affidavit; when the reviewing judge first opens the submission; the amount of time the judge spends reading the warrant affidavit; the moment the judge makes their legal determination; and if and when the warrant is served. By combining the warrant affidavit texts with digital timestamps and situating that data in the legal and extralegal context of judicial warrant review, we provide the most expansive and comprehensive view into the search and seizure process.",

At the same time, the results are also not fully consistent with the skeptical position that judges are not actually reviewing the warrants at all. On the one hand, some (albeit very few) warrants go through multiple revisions before being approved, and we identify moderate correlations between a judge’s professional background and review outcomes — observations that run counter to the proposition that all warrants are simply “rubber stamp[ed].”On the other hand, our key findings demonstrate that over 93% are approved on the first attempt; over 98% of all warrants are eventually approved; and the median time for a warrant affidavit to be opened, read, analyzed, and (in the case of approval) sent back to the officer in the form of a judicial warrant is only three minutes.
