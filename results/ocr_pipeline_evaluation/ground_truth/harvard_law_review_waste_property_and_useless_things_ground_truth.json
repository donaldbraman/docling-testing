      "text": "How should the law respond to intentionally useless objects that are constructed from scarce materials and thrust into an overcrowded world?Approximately sixty million tons of electronic waste, or “e-waste” — for example, discarded iPhones, refrigerators, desktop computers — is produced each year. This annual pile of electronic rubbish represents sixty-two billion dollars’ worth of tangible raw materials (such as gold and other scarce metals) that has been rendered useless. In addition to wasting raw materials, e-waste clogs our landfills, poisons the groundwater, and taxes our capacity to store it. Worst of all, much of this waste is intentionally created by electronics manufacturers through the profit-maximizing strategy of planned obsolescence.Planned obsolescence is a strategy by which manufacturers intentionally limit the utility of their products so that consumers are forced to discard them and buy new products. Planned obsolescence creates intentionally useless objects and imposes significant social costs. While some of the costs of planned obsolescence are felt within the manufacturer-purchaser transaction (a purchaser must consider whether a product will last long enough to justify its price), the most significant social costs of the strategy remain external to that transaction.This Article offers three principal contributions. First, a normative thesis: More of the social costs of intentionally useless objects should be borne by the manufacturers that profit from the strategy. Second, a theoretical insight: Avoiding waste is a central commitment of property law. In fact, many of the rules of property law are rendered more coherent when they are understood as a series of instantiations of an antiwaste imperative. Often confused with an efficiency principle, property law’s antiwaste commitment best explains doctrinal choices that otherwise would seem inconsistent. Finally, a doctrinal analysis: The antiwaste imperative (when applied to the existing rules of property) disallows the conveyance of a fee simple in an intentionally useless object. Recognizing an antiwaste imperative in this context would mean that manufacturers can only convey a defeasible interest in the object, retaining a reversionary interest that serves to correct some of the negative externalities associated with the strategy of planned obsolescence.",

When a manufacturer creates an object with an intentionally limited lifespan, the object has a defeasible conditionbuilt into the thing itself.

L. Inst.1936). An example of a defeasible estate might be: “Blackacre toA, untilAgoes to prison.” This conveyance would create a type of defeasible estate known as a “fee simple determinable,” and “going to prison” is a defeasible condition that could trigger the end ofA’s estate.Seeid.§ 44, at 121.

It describes an understanding of property law’s existing commitment to an antiwaste principle that disallows the destruction of property in the absence of use and enjoyment.SeeJohn Locke, Two Treatises of Government 249(London, Awnsham Churchill 1690). Applying this preexisting commitment in the context of planned obsolescence compels this result. However, it is reasonable to also characterize this as a normative point: that the antiwaste principle should be recognized to extend to this context. Some scholars might question whether a defeasible interest can be created in personal property, given the restriction ofnumerusclausus.See, e.g., Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith,Optimal Standardization in the Law of Property: TheNumerus ClaususPrinciple, 110Yale L.J.1, 17–18 (2000) (“A number of standard reference works state that personal property is subject to the same elaborate structure of forms that applies to estates in land (including future interests). Yet the case law does not fully support this broad proposition. It is reasonably well established that one can create a life estate in personal property. But there are few if any cases that address the question of whether more exotic interests, such as defeasible fees and executory interests, can be created in personal property.” (footnotes omitted)). However, in terms of the values that are supported by the rule ofnumerus clausus(for example, controlling complexity, lowering information costs, increasing certainty, and so forth,see id.at 8), there is little (if any) difference between the creation of a life estate in personal property (which is well established by case law) and a defeasible estate in personal property given that the defining characteristic in each estate is a future interest created in someone other than the present interest holder. In fact, a defeasible interest may serve to better control complexity, lower information costs, and increase certainty as compared to a life estate given that the termination date of a life estate is inherently unknowable, while a defeasible condition could potentially arise at a predictable point in time. Without a contrary directive from the courts, it is reasonable to assume that estates that exist in real property likewise exist in personal property.SeeMeredith M. Render,The Law of the Body, 62Emory L.J.549, 563 (2013) (“[I]n real and personal property the principal forms of ownership interest are the fee simple, fee simple defeasible, life estate, and leasehold.”); 96C.J.S.Wills§ 1355 (1936) (“A will may create a defeasible interest in personal property, meaning an interest subject to defeat by an executory bequest over on the happening of a future event or contingency.”).",

L. Inst.1936). An example of a defeasible estate might be: “Blackacre toA, untilAgoes to prison.” This conveyance would create a type of defeasible estate known as a “fee simple determinable,” and “going to prison” is a defeasible condition that could trigger the end ofA’s estate.Seeid.§ 44, at 121.

It describes an understanding of property law’s existing commitment to an antiwaste principle that disallows the destruction of property in the absence of use and enjoyment.SeeJohn Locke, Two Treatises of Government 249(London, Awnsham Churchill 1690). Applying this preexisting commitment in the context of planned obsolescence compels this result. However, it is reasonable to also characterize this as a normative point: that the antiwaste principle should be recognized to extend to this context. Some scholars might question whether a defeasible interest can be created in personal property, given the restriction ofnumerusclausus.See, e.g., Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith,Optimal Standardization in the Law of Property: TheNumerus ClaususPrinciple, 110Yale L.J.1, 17–18 (2000) (“A number of standard reference works state that personal property is subject to the same elaborate structure of forms that applies to estates in land (including future interests). Yet the case law does not fully support this broad proposition. It is reasonably well established that one can create a life estate in personal property. But there are few if any cases that address the question of whether more exotic interests, such as defeasible fees and executory interests, can be created in personal property.” (footnotes omitted)). However, in terms of the values that are supported by the rule ofnumerus clausus(for example, controlling complexity, lowering information costs, increasing certainty, and so forth,see id.at 8), there is little (if any) difference between the creation of a life estate in personal property (which is well established by case law) and a defeasible estate in personal property given that the defining characteristic in each estate is a future interest created in someone other than the present interest holder. In fact, a defeasible interest may serve to better control complexity, lower information costs, and increase certainty as compared to a life estate given that the termination date of a life estate is inherently unknowable, while a defeasible condition could potentially arise at a predictable point in time. Without a contrary directive from the courts, it is reasonable to assume that estates that exist in real property likewise exist in personal property.SeeMeredith M. Render,The Law of the Body, 62Emory L.J.549, 563 (2013) (“[I]n real and personal property the principal forms of ownership interest are the fee simple, fee simple defeasible, life estate, and leasehold.”); 96C.J.S.Wills§ 1355 (1936) (“A will may create a defeasible interest in personal property, meaning an interest subject to defeat by an executory bequest over on the happening of a future event or contingency.”).Return to citation ^",
