      "text": "International investment law provides stability for investors, helps capital flow across the globe, and can be a critical tool for sustainable development. This regime, however, has become increasingly controversial, in part due to its inability to reconcile investor obligations with competing human rights obligations. International investment treaties provide substantive guarantees to investors, including submission to binding arbitration in the event of breach. When found in breach of one of these guarantees, international investment arbitral tribunal awards are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially creating “regulatory chill” for states that may otherwise take affirmative action to protect human rights out of concern that regulation may run afoul of their treaties’ international investment provisions.",

It then advocates for its implementation through three approaches: (1) the contractual approach (treaty drafting), (2) the judicial approach (interpretative methods for existing treaties), and (3) the atmospheric approach (norm diffusion among stakeholders). The fiduciary theory not only provides a principled method to prioritize human rights but also enhances the legitimacy of the international investment legal regime. This framework offers a timely, pragmatic solution as the international community actively reconsiders the balance between investor protection and state sovereignty.",

A typical public company has millions of outstanding shares, if not billions.Thus, like a population, shareholders’ ownership power is often diffuse and difficult to exercise in coordinated and collective ways.Thus, left unchecked, directors’ management power can present an agency problem where the agent (directors) engages in opportunistic behavior at the expense of its principals (shareholders).Corporate law remedies this by placing fiduciary duties on directors.
