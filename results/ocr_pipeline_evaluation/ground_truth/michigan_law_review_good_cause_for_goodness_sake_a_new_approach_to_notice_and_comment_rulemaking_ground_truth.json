      "text": "Notice and comment is a public participation process, first articulated in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that was heralded at the time as a critical innovation to engage the general population in the administrative agency rulemaking process. It has been crippled in the past fifty years, first by a series of cases—primarily at the circuit court level—which imposed new procedural requirements on agencies outside the text of the APA itself, and then by technological advancements that have enabled sophisticated parties to game the system while boxing others out. Rather than creating a democratic open-door process, notice and comment has become inequitable, inaccessible, and ineffective. Procedural requirements imposed not by statute but by judges have created both a resource management problem and a litigation trap for administrative agencies, at times preventing them from achieving the actual governance that rules and regulations are meant to advance.",

The existing statutory tool—the good cause exception to notice and comment in section 553 of the APA—should be paired with a series of public engagement tools that are already available to agencies. Unlike notice and comment, these engagement methods are minimally resource-intensive and adapted to existing twenty-first century technologies. This approach preserves meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process while addressing many of the problems apparent in notice and comment without introducing new legislation, explicitly overruling any Supreme Court jurisprudence, or imposing new resource challenges on agencies.",

Notice and comment is rooted in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which describes regulations promulgated through informal rulemakingby an administrative agency as “pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment.”What has been seemingly lost on many is that the APA itself creates virtually no requirements for agencies other than a handful of vague references to “notice and receipt of public comment” throughout the statute.Rather, judges created the requirements that agencies follow today through a series of cases in the 1970s and ’80s.These cases laid out specific requirements for what agencies must do vis-à-vis notice and comment to survive the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review.Those requirements have ballooned well beyond the text of the APA, creating a procedure that is often incredibly cumbersome for agencies. Rather than enabling agencies to meaningfully engage with the public as intended, modern-day notice and comment allows business interests and other well-resourced actors to play an outsized role in the rulemaking process while draining the agency’s resources. Technological developments since the 1970s, when a series of administrative law cases expanded notice and comment, have only escalated these issues through phenomena such as mass comments.The rapid development of artificial intelligence will surely exacerbate these challenges.",

Some focus on legislative reform, proposing APA amendments and/or new legislation.Others suggest introducing alternative forms of public participation, such as federal advisory committees, to supplement notice and comment.However, few have entertained the concept that agencies could do only what is strictly required of them by statute to fulfill their notice-and-comment responsibilities. In fact, there is a situation in which agencies may bypass notice-and-comment requirements: “good cause rulemaking.”Agencies likely have been reluctant to employ the good cause exception for fear of litigation and negative court reactions. This exception is, however, the most effective and realistic option currently available to agencies to circumvent the mess that notice and comment has become. The 2024 Trump White House has instructed agencies to rely on the good cause exception to advance regulatory reform efforts,albeit relying on a different justification within the exception than that which this Note focuses on.",

Part I provides an overview of the existing tools for public participation in the rulemaking process, namely notice and comment; the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); and off-the-record consultation between senior agency officials and their industry contacts, what this Note refers to as “Rolodex Rulemaking.” Part II describes the problems inherent to each of these three approaches. Specifically, this Note addresses the ability to manipulate existing notice-and-comment processes; limitations on agency resources that strain both notice and comment and federal advisory committees; and inequity issues stemming from industry stakeholders’ involvement across notice and comment, FACA, and Rolodex Rulemaking. Finally, Part III proposes a solution and addresses the likely outcome of legal challenges. This Note argues for adopting alternate, modernized public engagement practices, modeled on efforts by the Biden Administration, in conjunction with the expansion of good cause rulemaking to fulfill the responsibilities that judge-made law has imposed on agencies throughout the history of APA jurisprudence.",

To the extent administrative agencies, despite being labeled by some as the “fourth branch of government,”are an extension of the democratically elected president and the executive branch, those same citizens who elect their president should have a voice in agency actions. What form that voice should take, however, is less clear. In the modern age, a handful of tools are available to engage the public in the agency rulemaking process. The most prevalent, and the most damaged, is the notice-and-comment process. Although agencies may supplement notice-and-comment procedures with other formal and informal processes, those processes do not replace notice and comment, given courts’ current expectations. The statutory requirements of notice and comment are minimal; however, case law has expanded those requirements beyond what is feasible for agencies today and beyond what the drafters of the APA envisioned.",

This move created one of today’s greatest notice-and-comment challenges for an agency: It must read every comment to ensure it does not miss comments of cogent materiality. Any comments meeting that standard must be addressed either by engaging with the commenter, incorporating the feedback into a final rule, or explaining why the agency did not incorporate the comment into the final rule. Of course, this type of engagement (in moderation) is the exact reason the APA included a notice-and-comment requirement in the first place.An agency should listen to and engage with stakeholders throughout the rulemaking process, especially when their comments are objectively material.

FACA “governs the process whereby the President or an administrative agency obtains advice from groups that include one or more non-federal employees.”The Act provides a framework for how such groups can be formed and specifies requirements (ranging from regularity to attendance and outcomes) for a federal advisory committee’s meetings.FACA’s requirements include procedural hurdles—such as mandatory consultation with the General Services Administration and ethics requirements for committee members.FACA’s formality often burdens the use of federal advisory committees with the same procedural challenges as notice and comment without addressing the transparency and accessibility issues created by both processes.",

The Biden White House and its executive agencies took a modern approach to publicity, using social media posts and websites dedicated to the review of specific rules and regulations alongside direct stakeholder outreach.Critically, this direct outreach, to be implementedin place ofnotice and comment, should cover a wide swath of relevant interests, reaching community members outside traditional business interests who might be impacted by the rule under consideration. A varied approach to publicity (which could include field visits to community and faith centers, schools, local nonprofits, etc.) would reach stakeholders beyond those who traditionally participate in notice and comment, avoiding some of the inequities created by the usual process.",

Importantly, these town halls and listening sessions should be available both in-person and online. Making these public engagement sessions accessible online will make them available to virtually everyone in the country.It is also critical that these listening sessions and town halls be tiered to reflect a bottom-up approach. Although some sessions should be available for anyone to join, as was the intent of the APA, holding smaller sessions for more senior or expert participants to engage with agency leadership will allow for more technical and advanced feedback to reach critical decisionmakers. However, these higher-level sessions should be made available to any organization with a stake in the matter, so long as they can send a representative from the appropriate level—making the higher-level sessions truly open and avoiding the trap of Rolodex Rulemaking. This tiered approach allows for officials at all levels of an agency to engage with their counterpartsas well asenable participation that is truly open to the public.",

The Biden Administration approached this prong as an opportunity to meet with “community organizations and data users to discuss the various changes . . . and to ensure that stakeholders understand” how a new rule or regulation works.These engagement efforts could mirror the listening sessions, town halls, and direct outreach that take place during rulemaking. But instead of providing feedback on the rule, stakeholders provide feedback on the process itself, creating a more iterative public participation mechanism than notice and comment. Ongoing engagement after a rule is finalized helps facilitate buy-in and commitment from those stakeholders who were engaged during the rulemaking process, which encourages them to continue engaging meaningfully in future rulemakings. Continued engagement with stakeholders after a rule is finalized and during its implementation stage could also help an agency demonstrate to a court its intent to fulfill the APA’s original purpose and prove that these new processes are not meant solely to make the rulemakers’ lives simpler. Although this step seems unnecessary for an agency rulemaking to survive judicial review, it is nonetheless recommended.",

The Court chose instead to focus on the fact that employing the good cause exception rather than notice and comment created no prejudicial error, and, therefore, did not procedurally invalidate the rules themselves.The respondents claimed there was a procedural deficit in the published notice of the rule; perhaps the Court would have approached the good cause exception differently if the challenge had been to the comment half of the process.
