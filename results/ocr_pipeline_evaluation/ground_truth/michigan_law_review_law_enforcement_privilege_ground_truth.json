The criminal legal system depends on fair and open proceedings to expose and regulate unlawful and unconstitutional police conduct through the courts. If police can use claims of secrecy to systematically thwart criminal defendants’ access to evidence, judicial review will fail. And yet that is exactly what is happening under a common-law doctrine called the “law enforcement privilege.” The privilege empowers police and prosecutors to rely on the results of secret investigative methods while withholding information from the defense about how those methods work. It risks perpetuating unconstitutional conduct, enabling wrongful convictions, and rendering Fourth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Brady, and statutory discovery laws moot. At the same time, it has a non-frivolous policy rationale. If all police investigative methods were public information, then more people committing crimes could evade detection.",

This Article argues that current law enforcement privilege doctrine creates a dangerously boundless police secrecy power because of a subtle conceptual collapse: The policy rationale itself is mistakenly used as the test for assessing claims of privilege. The Article recommends that courts instead evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk of leaking posed by in-court disclosure. Specifically, judges should demand to know what conditions law enforcement previously imposed on access to the information. The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will help judges detect mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent claims to the privilege. Further, even when law enforcement has taken care with the information, if a court-ordered protective order can match or exceed the safeguards that law enforcement itself previously maintained, then judges should default to ordering disclosure. The Article concludes by suggesting a theory of the role of confidentiality in privilege law.",

The law enforcement privilege risks entrenching investigative methods and forms of evidence that are flawed or inaccurate by preventing defendants from putting them to the test.

It is worth emphasizing this point: The privilege is not just an issue at suppression hearings; it also reaches substantive evidence of guilt or innocence. When the results of a method are ultimately introduced at trial, the method veers from investigative to forensic.In such circumstances, the law enforcement privilege still applies.

Some police investigative methods are potentially useless if would-be criminal actors know how they work.Thus, the argument goes, some lawful, constitutional, and reliable investigative methods are so sensitive that disclosing them to criminal defense counsel or expert witnesses, even under a protective order, would pose untenable risks of leaks.For instance, remote computer hacking tools that exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems can be used lawfully with a warrant and can prove crucial to investigating serious online crimes, such as the distribution of child sexual abuse materials,internet fraud,and terrorism.But if leaked, these tools instantly lose efficacy at scale. One such FBI hacking tool, which deanonymized computers visiting websites devoted to child sexual abuse material, was leaked to Reddit and, “within twelve hours,” the vulnerability that it exploited was patched, rendering the tool useless.Alternatively, leaked vulnerabilities that are not patched could be exploited by malicious actors to commit future crimes.Having no privilege protections for those types of investigative methods could effectively prevent law enforcement from using them at all.",

That testimony might be accurate, or it might be mistaken, exaggerated, pretextual, or fraudulent. Meanwhile, judges must evaluate privilege claims without the full adversarial process that they usually rely on to educate themselves about complex factual and legal issues. Instead, judges review allegedly privileged information in closed-door,ex parteproceedings, meaning only the law enforcement officers claiming privilege are present while defense counsel seeking the information are excluded. Such proceedings are valuable in that they avoid destroying a privilege in the process of determining its validity. However, they rob judges of the opportunity to hear additional facts and alternative viewpoints from the defense.The absence of adversarialism, in turn, guts the checks and balances of criminal defense adjudication. It is virtually guaranteed to create bias favoring law enforcement, and it encourages judges to give undue deference to police secrecy.Indeed, judges sometimes just take police officers at their word and decline to look at the privileged information to check each claim.",

The answer to that question can be adjudicated publicly without jeopardizing a legitimate privilege claim and will serve as a signal for the value of secrecy. If law enforcement has not taken sufficient care with the information, courts should default to denying privilege.Second, even when the government can cross the initial threshold by showing reasonable care, it should still be possible in many cases to accommodate defense access.

Police may rely on the outputs of that software to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant and then use the warrant to conduct a physical search of a suspect’s home and computer. If police find contraband during the search, the prosecution can charge the defendant withpossession. But the initial results generated by the surveillance software may be the sole evidence supporting a charge ofdistributionat trial.When the outputs of surveillance software could be introduced as direct evidence at trial, defendants may seek to challenge the reliability of the software system in aDaubertorFryeadmissibility hearing.

Circuit has held that the law enforcement privilege must be claimed by a governmental official who has personally “seen and consideredthe contents of the documents.”Other circuits seemingly lack this requirement.Ultimately, however, while a universal personal review requirement would help to ensure that everybody claiming the government’s privilege is democratically accountable, it is unlikely to entirely stop double-dipping; law enforcement officials beyond the prosecution team could still assert the privilege while leaving the prosecution in the dark and free fromBradyor statutory discovery obligations. In other words, even if courts were to strictly limit the privilege to information possessed by some part of the government, not by private entities, it would not solve the double-dipping problem.",

To lay the groundwork for a reasoned reform proposal, it initially debunked the current scholarly consensus that no privilege for law enforcement methods existed at common law. The erroneous view that the privilege is ahistorical mystifies the challenges of reforming what is in fact longstanding and entrenched. Next, the Article considered existing proposals to abolish the privilege, either entirely or for information possessed by private entities. Neither proposal withstands serious scrutiny.",

      "text": "Instead, the Article argued that courts should evaluate privilege claims by reference to the marginal risk ofleakingposed by in-court disclosure. To do this, judges should assess how law enforcement itself previously treated the purportedly privileged information. If the safeguards available through a court-ordered protective order could match or exceed law enforcement’s own prior confidentiality requirements, courts should default to ordering disclosure. This approach has substantive, institutional, procedural, and normative advantages. Though the approach deviates substantially from current appellate requirements, it has precedents in other areas of secrecy law and literature.",

      "text": "More generally, this Article’s analysis suggests a new “circumstantial evidence” theory of confidentiality’s role in privilege law as a whole, with potentially radical implications for government privilege writ large. Mostnon-government privileges that shield communications between two parties—such as the attorney-client, spousal, or psychotherapist-patient privileges—require claimants to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the allegedly privileged information. The standard explanation for this requirement is a utilitarian story about incentives. John Henry Wigmore, arguably the most influential evidence scholar of all time, thought that expectations of confidentiality incentivized people in certain relationships to communicate.He reasoned that privileges should apply only to communications that would not occur but for this incentive or, in his words, to communications that “originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.”That way, privileges could be characterized as cost-free to the courts, suppressing only evidence that would not otherwise exist.",

      "text": "But the incentives explanation is harder to buy for the many government privileges that shield topical information, such as law enforcement investigative methods; official records; or national security, military, and diplomatic secrets. Topical privileges do not always involve a person whose communications can be incentivized. Hence, the standard theory has left government privileges adrift. Unsurprisingly, the law enforcement privilege is not the only government privilege where current doctrine fails to factor pre-dispute confidentiality into the test for assessing a threshold claim.Indeed, just recently inUnited States v. Zubaydah, a case in which a torture survivor sought to compel testimony from the CIA contractors who orchestrated his torture, the Supreme Court doubled down on the government’s right to claim the state secrets privilege even for information that has been widely disseminated in the press.",

    {
      "text": "This Article has offered an alternative “circumstantial evidence” rationale for confidentiality requirements that applies as easily to topical as to communications privileges: A privilege claimant’s pre-dispute conduct concerning the confidentiality of information offers circumstantial evidence of the value of keeping that information secret. The evidence is especially useful because it is likely more reliable than post-dispute testimony, it leverages the claimant’s own expertise to assist in judicial review, and it can be adjudicated publicly in a fully adversarial hearing without revealing the actual contents of the purportedly privileged information. None of this reasoning need be limited to the law enforcement privilege alone. The issue of adding confidentiality requirements to constrain other government secrecy powers is thus ripe for further scholarly contribution.",
