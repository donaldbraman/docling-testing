Activist states and their chief prosecutors, already relying on “dubious” and “lawless” standing theories to circumvent decades of Article III limitations,leave the fate of consequential policy decisions in the hands of an unelected judiciary. And unlike other forms of federal policymaking, the Spending Clause allows states to retain their agency and reject what Congress offers them.

As Professor Jessica Bulman-Pozen describes it, new process federalism calls for a reimagining of federalism as a highly integrated state-federal relationship in which states act as “servant[s]” to the federal government in implementing federal policy.States, operating as conduits for federal regulation,can use litigation as an outlet to voice their discontent with federal policy.In this conception of federalism, states are not treated as co-equal sovereigns that must be protected from federal overreach, but as entities that should be able to “bargain with[] and even resist[] the federal government from within” the federal system.Conceptually, the standing “boost” underpinning special solicitude in many ways mirrors this scholarly perspective: Given states’ unique position in the federal regulatory world, Professor Seth Davis argues that, in decidingMassachusetts v. EPAthe way it did, the Supreme Court “all but announced state governments as the new public interest litigants.”In this way,Massachusetts v. EPAhas arguably stood not for any specific special solicitude doctrine, but rather a general invitation for state plaintiffs to “push the envelope.”",

In cases likeDoleandSebelius, there was no question that states had standing to sue given the legislation’s immediate obligations.There, the federal offers required legislation from the states—you don’t get this money unless you raise the legal drinking age.The states had to undertake immediate and definite compliance as a condition of receiving the money and risked losing existing federal funds if they failed to comply.In such cases that require near-immediate action for money, states would not be able to complete the required act if Congress’s expectations were ambiguous, or they would be unfairly forced to act if the bargaining was coercive or ambiguous. States have Spending Contract standing in these cases to challenge potentially ambiguous or coercive offers.",

Kentucky Department of Education, which provides that Congress is not required to “prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular applications” of its spending conditions,the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits effectively eliminated any interpretive wiggle room.

As Judge Bush explains in the majority opinion, “anylaw could be said to ‘limit the range,’ in an abstract sense, of a plaintiff’s legitimate behavior.”Federal legislation “cast[ing] a pall over legislators’ abilities to contemplate” lawmaking is far too subjective and abstract an injury for standing.States could always suggest that anything other than no limitations on federal funds would step on their sovereign toes.",

The state can no longer make law where it once could, regardless of the subject matter of that law. The constraint on this uniquely sovereign ability—to make laws for its own citizens—should be a justiciable injury-in-fact.

The Eighth Circuit appeared to shrug off Missouri’s special solicitude, holding that it had not otherwise met “the basic requirements for standing.”By contrast, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, similar to their analysis of the Tax Power injury,referencedMassachusetts v. EPAwithout outlining the substantive “work” special solicitude did in their analyses.Based on the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits’ temporally unrestricted description of the Spending Contract injury, special solicitude may be helping to eliminate standing’s imminence requirement.But it is hard to say for sure: Special solicitude seems to act as a vague, pro-state-standing background principle for these two courts in the same way as did the Tax Power injury. Judge Nalbandian also argued separately inKentucky v. Yellenthat special solicitude changed the test of imminence for state pre-enforcement standing from a “credible threat” of enforcement to the lower “risk of harm” for both sovereign and quasi-sovereign injuries.Judge Nalbandian’s framing treats any intrusion into a state’s affairs as a justiciable sovereign injury to the state.",

The Offset Provision cases were an intricate first attempt at conceptualizing together the two previously unwed doctrines. The fruits of the courts’ analyses, the Spending Contract and Tax Power injuries, although not entirely off base, are (in their current form) invitations for courts to find state standing in nearlyeverycase—regardless of whether there is, or there is even likely to be, actual friction between the federal and state governments.
