The antecedent tort duty, however, depends on the burden it would impose on the ordinary duty-bearer across the general class of cases the duty governs. The reasonableness of this burden is affected by social facts such as per capita wealth, the replacement of debtor’s prison with bankruptcy, the availability of liability insurance, and the social meaning of monetary damages. These normatively relevant facts are largely absent from modern accounts of tort law, even though they contract or expand the scope of substantive tort duties for noncontroversial reasons grounded in widely recognized tort values. An extended historical and doctrinal analysis confirms as much, showing how the scarcity of compensatory resources has shaped the basic structure of tort law—why it employs a default rule of negligence liability, sometimes supplemented by strict liability, while also being limited for wide swaths of negligently caused harms involving economic loss and emotional distress.",

Faced with widespread tort liabilities, large corporations have often declared bankruptcy, forcing tort claimants to accept pennies on the dollar as compensation for their injuries.This compensatory problem is brought into sharp relief by the Supreme Court’s recent decision involving Purdue Pharma L.P.’s bankruptcy after it faced at least $40 trillion of potential tort liabilities for manufacturing and distributing Oxycontin, the highly addictive pain killer largely responsible for triggering the opioid-overdose crisis.Although the case turned on the statutory powers of federal bankruptcy courts,it painfully illustrates how bankruptcy affects tort compensation. Under the plan the bankruptcy court approved, “if people experienced a potentially deadly addiction that could be linked to a Purdue prescription, they may receive the minimum payout, $3,500—a paltry sum.”Cases like this underscore the self-evident proposition that the compensatory properties of tort law depend on the availability of compensatory resources.",

This thought experiment, though obviously unrealistic, employs the historical practice common among ancient societies in the state of nature to compensate injuries with a “social currency” that is normatively different from the ordinary money which greases market exchange. In a world where injuries can always be fairly compensated with social currency, there is no normative concern about the prevention of injury. Without any injury-causing behavior to punish, punitive damages disappear, and the criminal law serves only to sanction those who shirk their compensatory obligations. The substantive structure of the common law would be radically transformed from its present incarnation, providing further support for the baseline proposition that the general availability of compensatory resources has substantive implications for tort law.",

The default rule of negligence liability accordingly centers on the equitable prevention of irreparable injury. The normative importance of injury prevention, in turn, justifies both punitive damages and criminal punishment for culpable forms of injury-causing behavior.

The compensatory obligation embodied the normative debt of social currency the defendant owed the plaintiff, and so insolvency involved a moral failure that merited punishment.Debtor’s prison—a prospect tort defendants faced in many states until the early twentieth century—supplied a powerful normative reason for sharply limiting tort liability. Extensive liabilities for ordinary negligence did not justify a prison sentence; tort liability had to be proportional to the defendant’s culpability. The subsequent emergence of modern bankruptcy law eliminated the burden of criminal punishment from this normative calculus. In principle, the transformation of debtor’s prison into modern bankruptcy could expand the scope of substantive tort liability, a dynamic that has never adequately factored into the leading accounts of tort law.",

An accident victim’s interest in economic security or emotional tranquility, though important and worthy of legal protection in the appropriate cases, could not justify sending someone to prison for their inability to pay off these tort debts. Such a severe deprivation of a negligent injurer’s liberty is normatively more burdensome than the accident victim’s financial loss or emotional distress. The problem of insolvency and the looming threat of debtor’s prison explain why courts of this era barred claims for pure economic loss and stand-alone emotional distress on the ground that duty-bearers would otherwise “face liabilities that are indeterminate and out of proportion to their culpability.”",

A key difference is that the monetary damages can fully repair pure economic losses (a dollar is a dollar). By contrast, real or tangible personal property (like one’s house and the personal items it contains) is not ordinarily a fully fungible commodity with other items in the marketplace and cannot be fully repaired with compensatory damages.Prioritizing physical harms over pure economic losses and stand-alone emotional distress is a normatively defensible position.",

Hence the fundamental thing that law does is to decide which of the conflicting parties will be entitled to prevail.",

Instead, they are used to create, maintain, and otherwise reorganize relations between people: to arrange marriages, establish the paternity of children, head off feuds, console mourners at funerals, seek forgiveness in the case of crimes, negotiate treaties, acquire followers—almost anything but trade in yams, shovels, pigs, or jewelry.",

When the risk is great enough, those injunctions are routinely granted.",
