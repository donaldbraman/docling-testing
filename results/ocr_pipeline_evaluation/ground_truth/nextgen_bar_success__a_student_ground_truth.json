Third, students themselves receive a unique benefit when asked to provide feedback on a method in the form of improving their metacognitive skills.While collecting student feedback may be slightly more difficult than collecting performance scores, any added burden is modest due to the fact that many legal educators are well-equipped to solicit feedback from their students (captive survey participants) through technological tools such as Canvas and SurveyMonkey.",
