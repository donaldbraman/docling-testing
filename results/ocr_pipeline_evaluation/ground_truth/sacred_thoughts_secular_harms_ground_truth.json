Though long venerated by scholars and judges,it was for many years the rare legal right searching for a legal wrong to redress.True, free thought might have held “a central place among our constitutional liberties.”But many struggled to explain what it was supposed to protect that would not otherwise be covered by free speech, free exercise, or another fundamental right.Today, though, the ever-increasing encroachment of technology has turned freedom of thought into the go-to answer for any number of modern ills, from social media manipulation,to data harvesting,to substance abuse.Even so, attendees of the free thought renaissance fair often skip over an important point: The Supreme Court has, over the last several years, in fact laid out what a more robust free thought doctrine might look like in practice. And that vision should give pause even to free thought’s most ardent champions.",

The line between one and the other is admittedly not always clear. The chain of references that the Court follows in303 Creativeshows why. The freedom to think means, as Justice Gorsuch notes, freedom to speak.And action can be speech when it is expressive;so expressive conduct, even if it is nothing more than discrimination, gets a pass under antidiscrimination law.It is not necessarily or readily apparent where this syllogism breaks down. But the result—an all-too-robust freedom of thought—cannot be squared with a rule of law that respects the dignity and rights of all persons. Figuring out how and where and in what way to intervene in this logical chain is a prerequisite to embracing a more expansive freedom of thought for all.",

L. Rev. 793 (2006). What he found was that when a court characterized the claim as involving a generally applicable law, the claim failed 74% of the time—i.e., no religious exemption was granted. Id. at 861. But when the court considered a claim involving the discriminatory targeting of religion, the claim succeeded 100% of the time. Id. The court in these cases either invalidated the law or granted an exemption. Id. In other words, courts were, post-Smith, having little problem actually applyingSmith’s framework. Laws could not single out religion, but nor could religion be used as a cudgel to assail laws that had nothing to do with religion....Close",
