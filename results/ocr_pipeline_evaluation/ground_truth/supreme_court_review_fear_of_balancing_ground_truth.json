      "text": "As a new Supreme Court majority settles into a new era of constitutional adjudication, the Justices will confront important methodological questions. How are they to go about interpreting the Constitution? In the Second Amendment case ofUnited States v. Rahimi,many of the Justices wrote separately to debate broader methodological questions about constitutional interpretation. They expressed a shared desire to turn away from judicial “balancing” of interests in adjudicating constitutional rights in favor of Founding Era understandings. That is a healthy instinct, but Founding Era understandings may in truth lead to balancing, so maintaining an originalist approach and an opposition to balancing is trickier than it seems. In future cases the Justices may need to resolve this tension by emphasizing the presumption of constitutionality, by making greater use of the principles of general law, or by crafting more rule-like doctrines for adjudication.",

AfterRahimi, the Solicitor General asked the Court to immediately resolve three pending petitions about the scope of Section 922(g)’s ban on felons possessing firearms, observing that the range of pending petitions would help the Court articulate a rule that would guide the lower courts.The Court summarily granted, vacated, and remanded them all without opinion.Sometimes it seems that fear of balancing might lead to a fear of opining in the first place.",

Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 928 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in the grant of stay). Justice Kavanaugh has expressed doubt about the usefulness of the maxim that courts “should simply try to ‘preserve the status quo,’” arguing that “[t]here is no good blanket answer to the question of what the status quo is. Each conception of the status quo is defensible, but there is no sound or principled reason to pick one over another… .”Id. at 930. The presumption of constitutionality provides a sound and principled reason to treat newly enacted legislation as the status quo. This presumption would of course be subject to rebuttal for “plainly unconstitutional … laws.”Id. at 931. Whether that same presumption would apply to administrative actions is another matter.",
