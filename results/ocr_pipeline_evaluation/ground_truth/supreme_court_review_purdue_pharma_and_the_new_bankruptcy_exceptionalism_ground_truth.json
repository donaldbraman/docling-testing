Purdue Pharma L.P.is about whether the text of the United States Bankruptcy Code gives courts the authority to approve nonconsensual third-party releases in Chapter 11.Section 1123(b)(6) of the Code allows Chapter 11 plans of reorganization to “include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”The question posed to the Court inPurduewas whether that language encompasses nonconsensual third-party releases. The majority concluded it does not. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for a four-Justice dissent, disagreed.",

These critiques typically refer to a concept of “bankruptcy exceptionalism.” Often the concern is that a non-Article III tribunal (the bankruptcy court) wields Article III powers.As we explain in Part I, we are skeptical that there is anything exceptional about these powers. All courts exercise discretion and fill gaps, and bankruptcy court discretion is firmly rooted in the text of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to de novo review in an Article III tribunal.Still, since the Code was enacted, the concern that bankruptcy courts possess too much authority and too much discretion has been the basis of numerous constitutional decisions limiting the power of bankruptcy courts.",

These include substantive consolidation, third-party injunctions, and for-cause dismissal. Indeed, one of the foundational pillars of Chapter 11’s statutory structure is its requirement that a plan can be confirmed only if it “does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable” to dissenting impaired classes.This language carries with it a long history of doctrine, judicial gloss, and discretionary invocation to prevent debtor misbehavior.It does not, however, come with a statutory definition.",

To understand this as problematic assumes that Article III courts should play a special role in private litigation, and that the availability of appellate review does not protect that special role.A critic of exceptionalism might also worry here that bankruptcy courts are resolving too many issues too quickly, and in a manner inconsistent with due process or Article III values.",

Indeed, as we pointed out in an amicus brief, examples of nondebtor releases imposed by the Lord Chancellor date at least as far back as 1619.Likewise, the Second Circuit had noted that releases should be viewed against the “backdrop of equity.”But the Court’s opinion eschews any reference to equitable remedies and focuses instead on colloquial discretion.",

For example, Section 1123(b)(6) gives a bankruptcy court authority to approve a plan that includes “any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”Section 1112(b) allows a court to dismiss a case “for cause.”Section 364(d) provides that a court “may authorize” the debtor to obtain credit if certain conditions are met, including a finding that the affected parties have received “adequate protection.”Section 510(c) provides that a court “may under principles of equitable subordination, subordinate an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest to all or part of another allowed interest.”Section 1129(a) requires that a plan of reorganization have been “proposed in good faith.”And Section 1129(b) requires that a nonconsensual plan be “fair and equitable” and that it not “discriminate unfairly” to be approved.These provisions all explicitly delegate policymaking authority and discretion to bankruptcy courts, establishing clear statutory grounds for flexible and responsive judicial decision-making.",
