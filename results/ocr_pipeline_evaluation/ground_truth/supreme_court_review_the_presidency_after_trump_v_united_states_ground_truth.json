United Stateswas not well received.A primary criticism has been that the Court’s ruling portends a “lawless presidency.”This criticism, I will argue, rests on a misleading picture of how the criminal law operates inside the executive branch. Many factors other than the President’s vulnerability to criminal law inform executive branch compliance with criminal law. One can certainly imagine a bad-man President afterTrumpengaging in widespread lawless criminal behavior. But, unfortunately, the bad-man President had many tools to skirt the criminal law beforeTrump, to which its uncertain immunity ruling added relatively little.",

But its impact will have less to do with the Court’s immunity rulings than with its related rulings on the President’s exclusive removal power and exclusive power over investigation and prosecution. These rulings, which were novel, expansive, and undertheorized, will play themselves out in litigation about the scope of presidential power for years. This Article, however, will mainly explore the slightly more tractable impact of the decision beyond judicial review and inside the executive branch, which will deploy the decision to help the President overcome legal constraints and win disputes with Congress.",

Garland Delivers Remarks on the Appointment of a Special Counsel (Nov. 18, 2022),https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-appointment-special-counsel. Smith retained many lawyers and investigators who had worked on the January 6 case prior to his appointment and hired new staff. Perry Stein,A Look at the Team Jack Smith Built to Try to Convict Donald Trump,Wash. Post(Sept. 10, 2023),https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/10/jack-smith-special-counsel-trump-investigations. Under Justice Department regulations, Smith had the powers of a U.S. Attorney and had to “comply” with Department rules and policies and “consult” with appropriate Department offices about them. 28 C.F.R. § 600.6–7(a) (2022). The Attorney General retained the authority to request from the Special Counsel “an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step,” and the power to “conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.”Id.§ 600.7(b). A Special Counsel is thus quasi-independent from the Attorney General, who is constitutionally subject to presidential direction but by virtue of norms—at least through the presidency of Joseph Biden—is independent of the White House.SeeDaphna Renan,Presidential Norms and Article II, 131Harv.

Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).

Lawson,Territorial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78Calif. L. Rev.853, 857–88 (1990).

Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988) (quotingNixon, 418 U.S. at 707), and that the Constitution requires only “safeguard[ing] against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other,”id.at 693 (quoting Buckley v.
