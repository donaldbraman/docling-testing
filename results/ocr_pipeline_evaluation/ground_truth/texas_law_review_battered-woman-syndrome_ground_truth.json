      "text": "We, as human beings, feel drawn towards mercy because, all else equal, it reduces human suffering. As formulated by Alwynne Smart, enacting mercy is “deciding, solely through benevolence, to impose less than the deserved punishment on an offender . . . when we are compelled to [do so] by the claims that other obligations have on us,” namely, compassion for an offender’s previous undeserved suffering.Theoretically then, victims of domestic violence who resort to killing their abusers as a means of escape are quintessential candidates for mercy. That is, solely through benevolence one could decide to exact less punishment than culpable murder merits because some factor, some sense of empathy for a battered woman’s misfortune, moves them to act mercifully. Although cases involving battered women defendants appear to be a perfect space for mercy, this area of the law is dominated by justice practices.",

Battered woman syndrome evidence was originally devised to mitigate injustice to battered women defendants.Its aim is to contextualize battered women defendants’ behavior in a way that more closely aligns with traditional self-defense elements in the hope of procuring the affirmative defense.Because battered woman syndrome has been operationalized as a justice practice, the features of our criminal justice system and public intuitions applicable to battered women prevent evidence of prolonged suffering and abuse—which could serve as a ground for mercy—from being actualized as a mercy consideration. Instead, justice-oriented thinking and practices have effectively annexed the available space for mercy to operate on battered women defendants.",

      "text": "This Note explores the ways in which battered woman syndrome is a classic ground for mercy and explains how the American legal system has, instead, embraced it as a justice practice. Because battered women syndrome is largely contextualized as a justice practice, criminal justice institutional structures and procedures often bar any opportunity for individual actors to bestow mercy. Even when such actors are presented with an opportunity to exact mercy on a battered woman defendant, decision makers may be dissuaded from doling out less-than-deserved punishment because of misconceptions about domestic violence and battered women. In turn, negative public opinion acts as a barrier to institutionalizing battered woman syndrome as a ground for mercy in the interest of upholding the moral credibility of our justice system. As a result, and perhaps unsurprisingly, there is little room for mercy to be dispensed to battered women defendants from within institutions that are designed to promote criminal justice.",

Part II explores the ways in which battered woman syndrome, and battered women defendants who have experienced long-suffered abuse, theoretically fit within the paradigm criteria for mercy. Part III discusses the practical implementation of battered woman syndrome evidence as a justice practice and the institutional features that prevent its realization as a mercy practice. Part IV analyzes the barriers to adopting an institutional rule of mercy for battered women defendants, focusing on the alignment of empirical and institutional desert assigned to battered women defendants, which is necessary to maintain the moral credibility of our criminal justice system. Finally, Part V evaluates the capacity for mercy to operate on an institutional level through governors’ clemency practices and explains why clemency actions ultimately fail to fulfill this potential.",

The “regular enforcement of the rules that make social stability (and thus social life) possible” depends on the equal administration of just punishments.However, “[p]ersons who administer the rules of the institution may be formally invested with the prerogative of mercy.”There are numerous spaces within our criminal justice process and procedures where individuals are tasked with the implementation of institutional or legal justice. Significantly, judges and other individuals who serve as representatives of the criminal justice system cannot always justifiably show mercy because their “job is to uphold an entire system of justice that protects the security of all citizens.”In other words, “there is no feasible way of granting to those who are less fortunate in the undeserved suffering they endure a right to more lenient treatment” from within the criminal justice system without granting institutional actors license to act arbitrarily, which would “seriously undermin[e] the goal of social security.”In contrast, within criminal justice processes, certain individuals, like jurors, who are not tasked with upholding the credibility of our institutions, have the opportunity to enact mercy.",

      "text": "Individuals acting within our criminal justice system, as opposed to institutional actors who represent the entire criminal justice system, can enact mercy because, at its core, mercy involves a voluntary waiver of one’s right to enact punishment or receive retribution.In a criminal context, an offender is thought of as violating the rights of an entire community, and therefore, it is the community who may rightfully waive its right to punish.Jurors, as representatives of the community, can rightly choose to exercise or forfeit the community’s right to punish. One reason individuals may decide to be merciful is that in cases in which an offender “succumbs, in despair, to a temptation to commit some crime, when he probably would not even have been so tempted had his life not been so miserable,” it seems cruel to exact the deserved punishment on top of the offender’s previous suffering, even though the suffering does not itself excuse or justify the crime.In this way, mercy can be seen as an attempt to “compensate the less fortunate” for previous undeserved suffering by imposing a less harsh punishment than an individual has the right to demand based on the offense.The “salience” of mercy considerations lies in humanitarian concerns in evaluating the effect a just punishment will have on an actor’s “well-being in the light of a searching and empathetic scrutiny of their character, life history and the broader context of their wrongdoing.”Thus, individuals may be compelled to extend mercy by some sense of compassion or benevolence but are never obligated to do so.",

Decision makers might reduce punishment in these circumstances not because the offenders did not act culpably but out of a compulsion to treat them in a compassionate and humane manner. That is, one may believe that “what was ‘wrong’ were external circumstances that we believe, but for the grace of God, would probably have caused us, as well, to act unlawfully.”Even if the battered woman culpably committed an intentional killing correlated with a level of deserved punishment, her overall suffering could be “cruelly exacerbated by the infliction in full measure of [her] just deserts.”Therefore, her situation properly elicits compassion that might lead to a reduced punishment, bestowed out of pure benevolence.",

While failure to resist the temptation to commit a crime is blameworthy, “mercy makes a concession to human frailty in such a case—to the failure of basically decent people to exercise the rational self-discipline that they should in difficult conditions to which they should never have been subjected.”In this view, mercy involves a recognition and calculation of the retributive gravity of an offense while also recognizing the circumstances which led the defendant to resort to deadly force.",

As originally proffered, battered woman syndrome was a pattern of behaviors and responses that Walker’s studies discovered in women who had been physically, sexually, or psychologically abused by an intimate partner.These symptoms have been continuously studied and refined since then and include some that are consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence, such as “[i]ntrusive recollections of the trauma event(s),” “[h]yperarousal and high levels of anxiety,” and “[a]voidance behavior [with] emotional numbing usually expressed as depression, dissociation, minimization, repression, and denial.”The most notable facets of Walker’s theory are the cycle theory and learned helplessness, which describe processes and patterns prevalent in abusive partnerships and one of the effects that domestic violence has on those who experience it, respectively.",

      "text": "Despite its potential as an avenue for mercy, battered woman syndrome—to the extent that it appears in legal practice—is a feature of justice rather than mercy. Although battered woman syndrome aligns with theoretical grounds for mercy, it was developed by academics and advocacy groups as a normatively mandatory measure to correct a perceived injustice in the ways our criminal justice system processes battered women defendants; thus, it has been implemented primarily as a component of a justification defense.Battered women tried for murder often utilize a self-defense justification defense.Jurisdictions vary in the exact wording of their self-defense doctrines, but deadly force is typically justified against another person only when an actor reasonably believed the force was necessary to protect themselves against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.These requirements are modeled after situations involving one-on-one male violence and do not account for the disparity “in size, strength, and economic power” between men and women, especially in a domestic violence context.Because of these disadvantages, women often resort to using a weapon against an unarmed man or choose to retaliate in a non-confrontational setting—like when their abuser is asleep—in order to have a fighting chance at escape.As a result, battered women defendants have a difficult time establishing that they reasonably believed that harm was imminent at the time of the killing.",

In other words, the admission of battered woman syndrome evidence is perceived as the minimum of what’s required to fulfill the demands of justice, rather than a pathway to mercy.",

      "text": "Moreover, the particular way battered woman syndrome evidence is utilized in the confines of the self-defense justification necessarily prevents it from providing a basis for mercy practices. Justification and excuse defenses are integral components of a criminal justice paradigm.Both justifications and excuses operate to help calculate an actor’s retributive desert by lowering punishment according to a lower perceived culpability.When a defendant claims an affirmative defense of justification, they “claim[] that the act was right or, at least, legally permissible, while a plea of excuse concedes that the act was wrongful, but claims that the actor should not be blamed for it.”More specifically, in a justification context, acts taken in self-defense are neither culpable nor condemnable.Operationalizing battered woman syndrome evidence as a way to support a self-defense justification promotes the idea that victims of domestic violence should receive diminished punishment because they are less culpable, and thus it is just to impose less punishment. This justice-oriented reasoning is inconsistent with mercy, which dictates acknowledging culpability and still reducing punishment in the interest of preventing additional suffering. In this way, utilizing battered woman syndrome evidence to bolster a justification defense roots battered woman syndrome firmly in a justice practice.",

Historically, evidence rules, crafted to ensure fair trials and to prevent unduly prejudicing or misleading the jury, could keep battered woman syndrome evidence out of trials altogether.TheFryegeneral acceptance standard for admissibility of expert testimony allowed judges to keep out expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome on the basis that the methodology and science behind it was not generally accepted.This was especially an issue in the 1980’s when research about battered woman syndrome and the effects of domestic violence was in its infancy.Battered woman syndrome evidence was criticized on the grounds that identifying which homicide defendants were truly battered women was difficult and for fear that the evidence would prejudice or confuse the jury.In response to these concerns, in the early 1990’s 20% of states required a defendant to first prove she was a battered woman, and over 25% of states required some showing that battered woman syndrome was accepted in the scientific community before admitting battered woman syndrome expert testimony.",

With no context provided for the defendant’s actions or mental state, no reasonable jury could find that a battered woman who killed her abuser in a nonconfrontational setting had a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious harm; thus, jurors had no reason to conclude a battered woman’s actions were justifiable. Similarly, the absence of battered woman syndrome testimony meant that jurors were likely left without any information on which to base mercy considerations—there was no evidence that would elicit the kind of sympathy or compassion that might compel jurors to recommend a reduced punishment. In 1993, the federal standard for expert testimony admissibility changed. Under theDaubertstandard, embodied in Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome is admitted if a judge finds it sufficiently reliable, based on several criteria.Most states now follow some variation of theDaubertstandard and admit some form of expert testimony regarding battered woman syndrome (or battering and its effects) to support a self-defense claim.",

Jurors are often instructed that they must find the defendant guilty if they believe the defendant acted culpably, unless the defendant’s actions fit into the self-defense framework.Battered woman syndrome fails to consistently fit battered women defendants’ behavior within the self-defense elements found in jury instructions, partially because these “[f]acts whose significance consists in their being grounds for mercy are, instead, implausibly presented as falling under categories (responsibility, justification, excuse etc[.]) that belong to the retributive norm.”As previously discussed, testimony regarding the defendant’s suffering at the hands of her abuser–victim, as well as her mental state, is most often operationalized within the context of a self-defense justification defense. Using battered woman syndrome testimony to explain battered women’s actions is “an artificial, if well-intentioned, ‘stretching’ of these categories [of self-defense] to achieve the desired result of a less severe punishment.”This artificial stretching fails to achieve its goal because battered woman syndrome evidence “introduces the idea that the woman has a psychological abnormality that makes her act in a certain way, yet it seeks to justify her act as a reasonable person who weighed the options of harm and greater harm.”Thus, battered woman syndrome evidence often fails to achieve the reduction in punishment it aims for.",

      "text": "Interestingly, there are some circumstances in which juries may extend mercy—rather than justice—to battered women defendants. Regina Schuller and Sara Rzepa’s study on the impact of battered woman syndrome expert testimony on jurors’ decisions found that expert testimony on battering and its effects only resulted in more lenient verdicts when jurors were instructed on jury nullification.That is, jurors only opted to reduce or eliminate punishment when they had been formally released from strictly applying the law they were given.This reinforces the idea that battered woman syndrome testimony’s “impact on verdicts did not appear to operate by providing participants with a better fit between her actions and the legal requirements of self-defense,” and instead operated “by increasing juror sympathy for the woman’s case.”In these instances, jurors extended mercy when given the chance to stray from strictly performing a justice function. Jurors were more swayed by factors that did not pertain to culpability—such as sympathy for the defendant’s previous, undeserved suffering—in reaching a decision to reduce punishment only when they perceived they could rightfully do so.This study highlights the way in which the use of battered woman syndrome to bolster a self-defense claim is strained. Battered woman syndrome testimony often does not meaningfully affect jurors’ assessment of a defendant’s culpability but may increase juror sympathy for the defendant. Further, it highlights that while jurors may develop some level of sympathy for a battered woman defendant in response to battered woman syndrome testimony, they do not utilize it in reaching a verdict unless given permission to do so. It follows that jury instructions that do not expressly afford jurors the authority to consider factors outside of a strict calculus of self-defense effectively remove any opportunity for jurors to act mercifully to reduce punishment out of a sense of compassion or benevolence.",

However, to ensure justice is fairly distributed, the criminal justice system must maintain a level of consistency and moral credibility that can be incompatible with an institution-wide distribution of mercy.The moral credibility of a criminal justice system is rooted in the community’s faith that criminal justice institutions impose punishment that roughly tracks the community’s consensus of blameworthiness.Public opinion regarding battered women and what constitutes justifiable self-defense, influenced by negative stereotypes and misconceptions about domestic violence and community intuitions about moral culpability, creates the measure of empirical desert the community assigns to battered women who kill their abusers.In actuality, empirical desert on this issue is likely closely aligned with the measure of institutional desert doled out by our existing self-defense laws. Institutionalizing mercy by reducing punishment under circumstances in which the wider community does not perceive lower culpability or any other ground to reduce punishment undermines the credibility of our criminal justice system.Although education on battering and its effects can induce sympathy for battered women, the general public is not educated on the realities of domestic violence.Thus, prevailing community sentiments are unlikely to support institutional rules that would carve out space for mercy for battered women defendants whose behavior does not fit in a legal definition of self-defense.",

However, Paul Robinson, in a study measuring public intuitions about culpability as compared to the existing criminal law, found that laypersons typically view “a killing that has some claim to be carried out in self-defense” as deserving of lesser punishment, even when a defendant “incorrectly but honestly believes that use of deadly force is necessary.”",

In other words, to the public, the question of punishment does not hinge on “whether victims of domestic violence have suffered,” but whether they should be “absolve[d] . . . of personal responsibility if they choose to take a human life—even the life of a vicious abuser—when there is available the option of taking another course to escape the abuse.”Further, a prevailing fear of vigilantism makes individuals wary of “the manipulation of” battered woman syndrome “as a rationalization for cold-blooded, premeditated murder.”These thought processes and misconceptions about battered women hinder the development of widespread compassion or sympathy for battered women who resort to violence on a societal level.",

Robinson defines empirical desert as “determining blameworthiness according to the shared intuitions of justice of the community.”This concept exists in contrast with deontological desert, “derived from the reasoned analysis of moral philosophy,” which underlies a traditional retributivist calculus of blameworthiness and punishment.Accordingly, the empirical desert—or community intuitions of blameworthiness—for battered women who kill their abusers is affected by public perceptions about domestic violence victims and community intuitions about the level of blameworthiness involved in killing under a variety of circumstances, as discussed above. The use of battered woman syndrome evidence at trial, while potentially effective in educating a jury, cannot alter the misconceptions of the broader public and therefore cannot alter the measure of empirical desert correlated with battered women who kill their abusers.",

This conclusion is bolstered by the lack of acquittals or leniency in verdicts afforded by jurors—representatives of the public—who are instructed solely to determine the culpability of a defendant who killed her abuser on the basis of self-defense.The very fact that battered woman syndrome evidence is intended to sway jurors’ natural intuitions about the culpable mental states of battered women defendants indicates that the community would assign liability to any offender who kills in a nonconfrontational setting. Moreover, because the effects of battering are not widely known or understood,the community’s conception of culpability of battered women defendants who kill in nonconfrontational settings is unlikely to differ from its conception of culpability of a defendant who claims self-defense in any other nonconfrontational killing. Therefore, in the context of a woman who resorts to killing her abuser, empirical desert likely aligns with the institutional desert, as represented by an actor’s liability (or lack thereof) under self-defense doctrine.",

If one goal of our criminal justice system is to impose deserved punishment, “mitigations of punishment based on mercy—factors unrelated to the offender’s blameworthiness—will set the offender in the wrong rank order as compared to other offenders,” and thus undermine the equitable distribution of just desert.Robinson explains that the efficacy of our criminal justice system depends on the cooperation and deference afforded by both its internal actors and the general public.This is facilitated when the law’s distribution of criminal liability aligns with the community’s intuitions about appropriate behavior and moral attitudes—the community’s determination of empirical justice.This alignment creates a sense of moral credibility and public confidence in our criminal law that lays the foundation for effective crime control, another key goal of our criminal justice system.Conversely, without a sense of moral credibility and “[t]o the extent that people view the system as unjust—as in conflict with their intuitions about justice—that acquiescence and cooperation is likely to fade and be replaced with subversion and resistance.”In this way, aligning institutional desert with empirical desert is crucial to maintaining a stable criminal justice system and is very likely at odds with an institution-wide distribution of mercy to battered women defendants.",

Thus, empirical desert would not include a reduction in punishment under these circumstances, and the criminal law’s divergence from empirical desert could potentially undermine the moral credibility of the law. Because there is little to no gap between empirical and institutional desert on this issue, lowering punishment below the just punishment deserved by battered women defendants is not a viable institutional justice practice.",

However, there could be an opportunity to institutionalize mercy for these candidates in the future without undermining the criminal law’s moral credibility on any other bases that develop community support.",

Typically “[b]eing perceived as too lenient towards killers can mean political suicide. If a governor is going to consider clemency cases, he or she must carefully craft the rationale for the decision to assist ‘criminals.’”Commuting or suspending sentences of individuals rightly found—or perceived to be—guilty jeopardizes a governor’s political career.

Similarly, jury instructions that dictate to juries they must find a defendant guilty unless her behavior conforms with the strict requirements of the self-defense doctrine can make jurors doubt their ability to mercifully reduce punishment based on the defendant’s previous, undeserved suffering; they believe they must make their decision solely on whether the defendant’s behavior conformed to a self-defense theory. Further, even when jurors are formally released from their role in dispensing justice, prevailing misconceptions about battered women often negatively influence jurors’ assessment of battered woman syndrome evidence and a defendant’s credibility.In turn, this often prevents jurors from developing the sympathy for a battered woman defendant needed to motivate them to mercifully lower punishment below that of an actor’s deserved punishment.",
