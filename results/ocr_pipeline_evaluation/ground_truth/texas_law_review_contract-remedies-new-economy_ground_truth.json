The parties agreed to share information,to work together through the anticipated multi-year project, and to use a dispute-resolution system that required senior management of both companies to resolve difficulties jointly.The arrangement focused on a particular compound—parathyroid hormone (PTH)—as an initial vehicle.If the collaboration was successful, Eli Lilly would market a pill using PTH. Otherwise, Lilly had no right “to use the Emisphere Technology or Emisphere Program Technology other than insofar as they relate directly to the Field [i.e., the project] and are expressly granted herein.”After several years, the arrangement broke down before the parties developed a pill to deliver PTH. The court agreed with Emisphere’s argument “that Lilly breached the final sentence in [the] provision [limiting Lilly’s rights] . . . by carrying out secret, independent research projects using Emisphere’s carriers with proteins other than PTH.”",

Few cases exist because contract law does not offer solutions to the problems of opportunism, exploitation, and differences of belief regarding project success that attend joint-development arrangements. As a result, an important segment of the U.S. economy functions today without a contract law. The justification for a state-supplied contract law, however, is that the law enables parties to make transactions that the parties would otherwise forgo. Collaborations performed well in the extraordinary circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. But an implication of contract law’s absence is that the American economy underproduces productive collaborations in ordinary times. It is this possibility that poses the two tasks we address in this Article: to explain why today’s contract law offers courts no tools for facilitating the new collaborations, and to begin to create a contract law for the facilitation of those collaborations. In pursuing these tasks, it is helpful to start by comparing the new collaborations to more traditional transactions.",

We focus on goods, which had two defining features: (a) the goods left the seller in their finished state; and (b) the goods were standard rather than made-to-order.The contracts under which parties traded these goods also had two defining features: (a) the contracts were simple, containing a price, quantity, description of what the parties were trading, and sometimes a warranty; and (b) the transactions could be concluded in a single stage—the seller tendered and the buyer accepted. Later in the twentieth century, sellers began to make goods to suit particular buyers’ needs, but again the buyers did not participate in production. The contracts that governed trade of these specialized products were also simple. A contract would describe the functions the specialized goods were supposed to perform, set a performance schedule, and, sometimes, specify a remedy for the seller’s breach. We denote the trade of standard and specialized goods, together with the contracts that governed the goods’ trade, the “traditional economy.”",

Parties conduct deals today under agreements that are not contracts as the Restatements define contracts;rather, they are “framework agreements” that describe the cooperative behavior in which parties agree to engage. Many of the tasks that a framework agreement assigns to a party—e.g., exploring marketing opportunities—are not observable by the other party, but the task structure itself has a public component. For example, a framework agreement would not require a party to execute a particular task optimally when the counterparty could not observe how the party performed the task, but the agreement will require the party to report a task result. Reports are observable. In consequence of the exploratory nature of the parties’ project, framework agreements also do not set prices or specify quantities at early stages. This is because parties cannot precisely predict the cost and value of what they may ultimately produce. Finally, parties intend their framework agreements to be “self-enforcing”—that is, each party expects the other to comply independently of the state’s power to enforce. These commercial arrangements, together with the framework agreements that govern them, constitute what we call “new-economy collaborations.”",

The disappointed promisee-buyer receives a sum equal to the value the promisee-buyer expected to derive from the trade, or the disappointed promisee-seller receives a sum equal to the profit the promisee-seller expected to make. The expectation remedy thus puts the promisee in the same position financially that it would have occupied had the promisor performed.Second, the expectation remedy permits parties to reallocate their resources efficiently when a deal turns out to be inefficient to conclude. A promisor thus may trade with a higher-valuing buyer on paying the promisee its expectation, thereby making the promisor better off without making the promisee worse off.",

For example, a court cannot award a disappointed seller its profit unless the court can observe the contract price and the seller’s production cost. Prices are convenient for courts to observe; cost and value are sometimes not. The expectation remedy therefore facilitates exchange efficiency best in developed markets in which goods trade at their market prices.Contract law also protects investment efficiency in developed markets because the disappointed promisee can resell to or repurchase from another market participant. Because the market provides parties with satisfactory substitutes for failed deals, the contract seller will invest to minimize its costs and the contract buyer will invest to maximize its value.",

Because there is no market price for a specialized product, courts must observe actual values and costs in order to determine whether the seller invested as it promised and to measure the buyer’s loss from breach. An informed court is necessary because parties have incentives to shade performance. Thus, a seller who is guaranteed the price may underinvest in performing the customization task, and a buyer who is guaranteed the goods’ value may overinvest in increasing that value. Without being able to observe the investment level each party chose (or whether the investment was optimal), a court cannot deter such strategic behavior.

In the new economy, by contrast, parties agree to develop jointly, in multistage collaborations, either a product to trade to third parties or a product that is tailored to the contract buyer’s needs. Thus, in the new economy, “breach” consists of not performing unobservable assigned tasks, not performing the tasks that the public aspects of a framework agreement require, otherwise withholding or wrongfully exploiting private information, or just exiting before the end. Contract law cannot respond effectively to such breaches because the expectation remedy is conditioned on price, cost, quantity, and value. When a party defects from a new-economy collaboration early on or at the implementation stage, the development process is unfinished: parties have incurred costs but do not have a product. Hence, they do not have a price, nor can they predict product costs, how much they will trade, or ultimate transaction value. A disappointed buyer, say, cannot recover the difference between the product’s value and the price, when value is yet to be determined and there is no price.",

      "text": "Finally, first-mover concerns disproportionally affect the new collaborations. To see why, suppose that a traditional-economy seller can produce specialized goods only by making a sunk-cost investment—that is, for example, by modifying its facilities so that the facilities can best produce the specialized product.Afterthe seller invests, the parties bargain to set a price for the new product. The bargain will not compensate the seller for its relationship-specific investment because future-oriented bargains ignore sunk costs. Anticipating being “held up” by the buyer, the seller will not make the sunk-cost investment. This is an unrealistic example for the traditional economy, however, because the seller can protect itself byobtaining a legally binding promise from the buyer to pay the price.In contrast, in new-economy collaborations, parties must make exploratory and productive investments in order to see whether a new product is feasible and, if so, to create it. These investments are specific to the possible deal and parties must make them before contractual protection is possible. Therefore, new-economy sellers are more subject to holdup than traditional-economy sellers are. This is an important reason why new collaborations are probably underproduced.",

The state’s principal concern at this stage should be to induce parties to participate in potentially profitable arrangements. We suggest that reliance should be the default remedy when parties begin a transaction but one of them inappropriately defects. There are two reasons for this suggestion. First, as just stated, an expectation remedy may be impossible to implement when the variables on which it conditions are unknown. The second reason is more subtle: expectation damages, if a party could prove them, exceed reliance damages because parties expect a transaction’s gain to exceed its costs. However, when both parties are highly uncertain about whether a deal will come to fruition but are certain that they will incur substantial costs in finding out, they often prefer being insured against the nontrivial probability that exploratory costs will be wasted to being insured against the much lower probability of not realizing expectation gains. Thus, a reliance remedy is often more likely to encourage participation in a new-economy collaboration than the expectation remedy, even when an expectation is provable.",

The state’s concern at this stage should be to encourage parties to “continue to play the mechanism”—that is, to comply with their framework-agreement plan. Defection can occur for several reasons, set out in subpart I(C) of this Article, but a particularly important cause of a possible breakup is that parties may come to have different beliefs regarding the efficient path forward and about the adequacy of the framework agreement as written to direct the right path to success. Recalling that parties intend framework agreements to be self-enforcing, parties today address the defection problem in two ways. Their principal method is to make a party’s continuation payoff exceed its defection payoff. For example, a framework agreement may enable a compliant party to access the intellectual property their arrangement created but deny access to a defecting party.

First, the prohibition against penalties should be relaxed so that courts enforce framework-agreement sanctions. Our second extension is directly responsive to the inconsistent-beliefs cause of arrangement breakdowns. There should be a new contract-reformation doctrinethat would permit courts to reform a contract not only to correct a mistake of fact made at the time of formation but also to reform a framework agreement so that it reflects the efficient course forward in light of what has come to be knownex post. Traditional contract interpretation occurs after a breach, while the “midstream” reformation we propose would prevent breach by permitting a court to adapt the parties’ contractual mechanism to changing circumstances.Finally, cooperation may fail even when parties hold consistent beliefs. For example, a party’s outside option may improve so that defection becomes more attractive. We suggest an extension of the specific-performance rules for such cases. A cooperative party should get specific performance,notto require its counterparty to deliver a product, but rather to compel a potential defector to follow the public aspects of the framework procedure.",

But because the scholarly focus has been on how collaborations succeed, little attention has been paid to the question of how collaborations fail. Deal failure, however, is an ever-present possibility,and it is the possibility on which lawyers should focus. Thus, we ask a largely original question: how cancontract lawincrease the probability that parties enter new-economy collaborations and efficiently implement them?

The parties then could renegotiate to theex postefficient state because the parties would be symmetrically informed.

At the pivot stage, court intervention through an expanded reliance remedy encourages parties to enter into collaborations by enforcing the parties’ commitments to explore opportunities. At the implementation stage, we suggest that the court should actively coordinate the parties’ behavior in two ways. Initially, courts can respond to the parties’ epistemic conflict arising from inconsistent beliefs by reforming their contract so that it reflects the efficient path forward. And where realigning party beliefs is insufficient to keep parties on that path, the court can mandate cooperation by requiring adherence to the framework agreement. Adjudication will refine these remedies, but we stress the central point: new-economy collaborations require new roles for common law courts.",

We add to this toolkit new default legal remediesthat parties could use when the remedies would increase the parties’ ability to induce entry into and compliance with a framework agreement. When one party is weak (i.e., when the parties have unequal bargaining power), this empowerment also might have distributive effects, facilitating collaborations that otherwise would not take place when the weaker party lacks access to self-enforcing reputational mechanisms.",

For an example of how such a barrier functions, suppose that the larger the stock of knowledge a party has about its counterparty, the lower the marginal cost of continuing to work with the counterparty is. It follows that defecting from a framework arrangement to pursue a similar project with another firm would initially be more costly than continuing with the current partner. Because the potential defector has no stock of knowledge about the new firm, it would have to incur high startup costs again. Denote the difference between the initial high marginal cost a new relationship would require and the low marginal cost of staying with the contract partner as a “switching cost.”Investment in learning about the counterparty thus facilitates cooperationwithina framework collaboration by creating switching costs that would attend defection. Parties actually design their framework process to create “coordination cascades,” where the specific investment of one party requires coordination with the other, whose response then requires further coordination with the first party.All along, a party’s stock of knowledge about its counterparty increases.

Because reliance is not the remedy the law permits—there must be an enforceable promise—a contractually required transfer that approximates reliance is not enforceable.Suppose, however, that the expectation usually is too difficult to prove at the initial stage and that reliance damages sometimes are efficient.

The buyer wants to complete a transaction with probability,p(not to be confounded with thepwith subscript indicating the price insupranote 122), and the seller wants to complete the transaction with probability,q. We assume thatpandqare independently realized. In practice, there may be some correlation between the parties’ probability estimates, but if the probabilities were perfectly correlated, the parties could never disagree about whether to perform the contract or not. That probabilities are independent implies that they may differ: the seller and buyer could have different beliefs at the outset—different “priors”—about whether their deal will succeed. Now, under the first approach to the parties’ investment behavior, a party’s investment affects only the substantive variables: value,v, and cost,c. For example, the buyer’s investment,r, increases its value (i.e.,v(r)) but does not affect the probability that the buyer assigns to deal completion. Thus, we treat the parties’ probability estimates as constants. Under the second approach, a party’s investment affects the probability it assigns to deal completion but does not affect the value of the substantive variables (e.g.,p(r) andq(s) for the buyer and seller respectively wheresis the seller’s specific investment). Here, we treat the variablesvandcas constants. The two approaches yield similar qualitative results because both parameters are concave in investment. This means that, under the first approach, the buyer’s value is increasing in its investment but at a decreasing rate, and that, under the second approach, the probability of completing the deal is increasing in the buyer’s investment but at a decreasing rate, and similarly for the seller. Concavity implies that there is an interior solution at the optimum for a party’s investment program.↑",

It would be socially efficient, however, for the buyer to consider the actual likelihood of the deal going through, which is the joint probability—pq—that both parties will prefer performance, whereqis the probability the seller will want to perform. The efficient buyer thus maximizespq(v(r) –k) –r. The efficient level of investment,r*, therefore solvespq(v’(r)) = 1. Becausepqis less thanp, the sophisticated buyer invests more than the efficient buyer would invest.↑",

      "text": ".This technical note establishes the conclusion in text. Recall that we are considering relation-specific investment with bilateral uncertainty.See supranote 129. Hence, both the buyer and the seller have incentives to take the possibility of their own defection into account. The buyer’s uncertainty implies that his value isv(r) with probabilityp< 1 and zero otherwise. The seller’s uncertainty implies that her cost isc(s) <v(r) with probabilityq< 1, which implies that its cost isc>v(r) with probability 1 –q. The buyer’s investment program, which is identical to the social planner’s program, should solvepq(v(r) –k) –r. The socially optimal relation-specific investment,r*, is then determined by the first-order condition (FOC):v’(r) = 1/pq. Under expectation damages, the buyer maximizespq(v(r) –k) +p(1 –q)(v(r) –k) – (1 –p)q(k–c) –rso the equilibrium investment,red, is determined by the FOC:v’(r) = 1/p, from which we havered>r*by the concavity ofv(r). Under reliance damages, by contrast, the buyer maximizespq(v(r) –k) +p(1 –q)(r) – (1 –p)q(s) –r, wheresis the seller’s specific investment. The equilibrium investment,rrd, is determined by the FOC:v’(r) = (1 –p+pq)/pq. Because 1/pq> (1 –p+pq)/pq, by the concavity ofv(r), we haverrd>r*.Under the reliance remedy, there is still overinvestment. But because (1 –p+pq)/pq> 1/p, also by the concavity ofv(r), we havered>rrd, which means that overinvestment is lower under the reliance remedy than under the expectation remedy. A similar argument applies for the seller.↑",

A technical discussion would be out of place, but the basic intuition is simple. Players’ choices of strategies (e.g., to cooperate or not cooperate) may be correlated when the players condition on the same random events to decide which strategy to play. Now consider a game that includes an “observer” (e.g., a court) whose task is to recommend a strategy to each player. The observer will recommend a subset of strategies according to a probability distribution over the set of possible strategies, which the players commonly know. This probability distribution is called a correlated equilibrium if the strategy vector in which all players follow the observer’s recommendations is a Nash equilibrium—that is, if following the recommendations is the best response (the most efficient action) each player can take.↑",

When the buyer’s outside option is set to zero, the buyer’s expected return—which determines his willingness to participate in the transaction—under expectation damages ispq(v–k) +p(1 –q)(v–k) – (1 –p)q(k–c) –r. The buyer’s expected return under reliance ispq(v–k) +p(1 –q)r– (1 –p)q(s) –r. Reliance damages provide a greater incentive to participate than expectation damages whenp(1 –q)r– (1 –p)q(s) >p(1 –q)(v–k) – (1 –p)q(k–c). Rearranging this expression yields the inequality in the text. The reader can also check that the seller’s condition that makes it prefer reliance is satisfied whenq/(1 –q)(ΠB–s) ≤p(1 –p)(ΠB–r) holds. Exploratory-specific investments for new collaborations are both fixed and continuous. One can define a fixed investment as the lower bound of a continuous investment, but it is more illuminating to regard fixed investments as necessary for the buyer (Firm A) and the seller (Firm B) to make in order to begin operations. A continuous investment increases the contract surplus once the relationship has begun. Note, however, that because damages are a zero-sum game—increasing one party’s damage payoff reduces the other party’s payoff—the buyer’s and seller’s conditions for preferring reliance over expectation damages sometimes cannot be satisfied simultaneously.↑",

The remedies we advocate for parties’ implementation-stage disputes would function in this way.↑",

      "text": ".Arbitration clauses in commercial contracts generally incorporate by reference the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, which expressly allow the arbitrator to grant specific performance of a contract, but are silent with regard to penalties, fines, or punitive damages.SeeAm. Arb. Ass’n,Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures R-47(a) (2013) (“The arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties,including, but not limited to, specific performance of a contract.” (emphasis added)). Whether an arbitrator’s award of equitable remedies or punitive damages will be judicially enforceable, however, may depend on whether the arbitration is governed by state law or by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrators currently do not have the power to award punitive damages under New York law.Avoiding a Punitive Damage Award in Arbitration,Norton Rose Fulbright(April 2015), https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/19c69c28/avoiding-a-punitive-damage-award-in-arbitration [https://perma.cc/4BHM-3HAL]. Judicial review of an arbitral award of a penalty can be thought of as an attempt by the judiciary to “extend to arbitration agreements the penalty-liquidated damages distinction of traditional contract law.” Note,The Enforceability of an Arbitrator’s Award of a Penalty, 52Colum. L. Rev.943, 945 (1952). For a discussion of the history of judicial review of arbitral awards of equitable remedies and punitive damages, see generally Stephen P. Bedell & Louis K. Ebling,Equitable Relief in Arbitration: A Survey of American Case Law, 20Loy. U. L.J.39 (1988) and Stephen P. Bedell,Punitive Damages in Arbitration, 21J. Marshall L. Rev.21 (1987).↑",
