But if you scan law-school casebooks or the decisions of the Supreme Court, you won’t find many appellate orders addressing discovery disputes.The few exceptions are cases likeSeattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,which is intertwined with constitutional considerations, orHickman v. Taylor,which involves an important common-law doctrine and is an interesting outlier (the rare trial-level en banc decision!) in many ways.The Supreme Court issued two opinions directly deciding discovery issues in 2022—the first since 2017.But these are the exceptions illuminating, if not proving, the rule that discovery disputes rarely receive grants of certiorari. Even there, the discovery questions involved foreign relations and national security, two separate, high-profile issues.",

      "text": "This Article challenges the consensus view that discovery happens in a “vertical vacuum.”First, in the Roberts era, pivotal references to discovery appear in a significant number of the Court’s decisions.Most notably,Bell Atlantic Corp. v. TwomblyandAshcroft v. Iqbalchanged the pleading standard in federal court because of concerns about the ostensible cost of discovery.In this manner, discovery acted like the “legal equivalent of dark matter, which can be observed . . . through its gravitational effect upon other bodies.”Put another way, at the Supreme Court-level, discovery is most easily seen by its influence on non-discovery jurisprudence. Second, the Court’s discovery dicta then radiate back out as trial-level courts cite these non-discovery cases in their discovery orders. As such, we see how the Roberts Court uses its soft authority—through dicta and other commentary—to signal its views on discovery policy and guide the trial-level courts’ application of the law, effectively, if informally, fulfilling its traditional appellate role.Third, the rising use of magistrate judges has created another unheralded body of de facto appellate decisions on discovery disputes: district judges’ oversight of magistrate judges instead of appellate judges’ supervision of district judges.",

Since Chief Justice Roberts joined the Court, it has heard just six discovery merits appeals, all of which presented policy issues that went beyond the mechanics of discovery.But concerns arising from bread-and-butter discovery have famously appeared in the Court’s decisions on pleading standards.This Article uncovers how fears about the ostensible burdens of discovery are also used to justify decisions about jurisdiction, interbranch conflicts, First Amendment challenges, the reach of certain statutes, and other issues.Furthermore, Chief Justice Roberts has used his year-end reports to opine on the role of discovery in civil litigation, offering cautionary notes about its costs.At minimum, these mentions signal the Justices’ views on the normative and functional value of discovery. And those hints shape the analysis of the lower courts even if the Roberts Court’s antipathy to liberal discovery has not been fully adopted.",

In part, the Article creates a repository of cases in which the courts describe their visions of their own institutional competencies in addressing discovery issues. These firsthand accounts are then connected to the long-espoused scholarly theories of the functions of trial and appellate-level courts. It also collects examples in which the absence of appellate guidance has led to errors and has impeded the development of uniform law. Next, the Article surveys all of the references to discovery during the Roberts era, identifying discovery’s covert role in the Court’s jurisprudence. Additionally, it examines the extent to which the Court’s use of its soft authority is affecting decision-making on discovery issues by providing trial-level judges with a window into the Court’s view of the underlying principles and normative tradeoffs. It then looks at district judges’ evaluations of challenges to magistrate judges’ orders, highlighting examples where the district judges appear to be successfully correcting errors and clarifying the law.",

At the other end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court uses its bully pulpit to make pronouncements about the normative tradeoffs implicated by common discovery disputes, which have, at least, some traction in the lower courts.
