Semiconductors are the basis of nearly all industrial, commercial, and military systems—almost everything in the modern world relies in some way on semiconductor technologies.For instance, semiconductors can be found in cellular devices, computers, pacemakers, cars, and many common household items.And our reliance on semiconductor technology is not expected to diminish any time soon.As such, semiconductors—and the behavior of semiconductor firms—have been a central focus of domestic policy.",

Extraterritorial application of law is “the competence of a State to apply its laws to foreign entities in relation to their, often purely foreign, conduct.”Specifically, in the United States, this refers to “the extension of federal law to activity outside the territorial confines of the United States.”Despite language in the Patent Act expressing territorial limits,U.S. patent law has traditionally been extended outside of domestic contexts.The question is: How far do the territorial boundaries reach? This Note explores the tension between the presumption against extraterritoriality and the common-law notions of causation and full compensation.",

Part II then focuses on the relevant case law impacting the scope of extraterritorial damages in patent law, discussing cases in which foreign damages arose based on a domestic act of infringement under §§ 271(a) and (f) of the Patent Act. The analytical framework discussed in Part I is woven throughout much of the courts’ reasonings as they attempt to define the territorial boundaries of patent law. In analyzing the Federal Circuit’s treatment of extraterritorial damages, Part II then considers the extent to which the Supreme Court’s recent decision inWesternGeco IIhas impacted subsequent lower court decisions. Lastly, Part III calls for a serious consideration of the impact that these judicial decisions may have on the semiconductor industry. It begins by providing an overview of the semiconductor industry and ultimately concludes that the extraterritorial application of patent damages should be permitted in cases of direct infringement occurring within the United States.",

First, it is “heavily grounded in international law and the principle of prescriptive comity.”Specifically, the presumption “serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.”Second, in a similar vein, the presumption attempts to mitigate issues with conflict of laws by following another key canon of statutory interpretation: federal statutes should be construed so as not to conflict with international law.Thus, the Court applies the presumption to avoid “difficult issues of international law”and to “avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations.”",

European Community,the Court addressed the question of whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act applied extraterritorially.The Court applied a two-step methodology to assess the scope and reach of the racketeering statute. Incorporating the presumption against extraterritoriality, the first step determines “whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted—that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially.”If such indication exists, then the presumption is overcome, and the statute is granted extraterritorial reach within the limits imposed by Congress.However, absent any clear indication from Congress rebutting the presumption, a court should “determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute . . . by looking to the statute’s ‘focus.’”Specifically:",

For instance, a patentee can seek price erosion damages if it was forced to lower prices to remain competitive with the infringing product.Or, under the entire-market-value rule, if the accused product involves only one component of a larger device, it is possible for the patentee to recover lost profits for theentiredevice.In addition, a patentee may attempt to recover future lost profits and, under some circumstances, losses resulting from “harm to the reputation of the product or the patent holder.”",
