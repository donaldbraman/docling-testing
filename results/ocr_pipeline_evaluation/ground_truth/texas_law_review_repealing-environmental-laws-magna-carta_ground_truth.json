It was the sixth significant environmentalist loss in the Supreme Court in the past four years, and the losses involved four different important environmental protection laws.In two of those prior cases,the Court cut sharply back on the reach of two of the nation’s most important pollution control laws: the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. WithSeven County,the Justices have now completed the trifecta―undercutting the nation’s foundational environmental planning law and its lofty purpose to “prevent or eliminate damage to the environment”―based on their own version of “common sense.”",

For much of the past five decades, since the emergence of modern environmental statutory law in the 1970s, the evolving process of environmental lawmaking prompted courts and legislatures to reconcile the inevitable conflicts generated between new environmental laws and pre-existing, cross-cutting areas of law by making the latter more accommodating to the former. This was evident in evolving principles of administrative law, constitutional law, corporate law, and criminal law during that time, all of which changed in ways to make environmental protection law more effective.",

NEPA requires that federal agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for any proposals for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”There was no dispute here that an EIS was required. There was the requisite federal agency (the Surface Transportation Board). That agency was proposing a major federal action (permitting the 88-mile extension of an existing freight rail line in Utah to facilitate development and production of waxy crude oil in the Uinta Basin—the geographic area to be served by that rail line).And that railway line, if permitted, would result in significant adverse environmental effects.There was similarly no dispute under established Supreme Court precedent that the EIS neednotconsider all the “but for” adverse consequences of the proposed Board action to be adequate.",

These are “upstream” consequences.After all, the very purpose of the railway line was to promote that increased oil production activity.Looking outside the geographic boundaries of the project, other possible adverse environmental effects would be to look “downstream” of the project to the increased railway traffic the new railway line might causeoutsideits own 88-mile length, including railway accidents and oil spills.Finally, even further removed in time and space, the effects might include the increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by the refining of the crude oil once it reached its final destination hundreds of miles away in the Gulf States.",

This categorical argument repeatedly relied on Congress’s 2023 amendment of NEPA―even though the amendment was made years after the EIS was completed―as making clear that Congress did not support the D.C.

The new congressional limits could not be squared with the kind of sweeping EISs contemplated by respondents and the D.C. Circuit. Here, the respondents were arguing, and the D.C. Circuit had held, that an EIS related to an 88-mile railway line had failed to consider all the reasonably foreseeable consequences—when the Surface Transportation Board’s EIS was itself more than 600 pages long, and supplemented by almost 3,000 additional pages of appendices and responses to public comments.Absent a significant cutback on what was considered a reasonably foreseeable consequence of a proposed major federal action, federal agencies could not possibly realize Congress’s clear understanding, at least as of 2023, of the more limited role that NEPA should play.",

The Supreme Court has repeatedly limited NEPA over the years, including ruling that its requirements are only procedural and not substantive.However, the federal courts have, followingCalvert Cliffs’lead, largely supported the expansive and demanding view of NEPA’s requirements―“Congress did not intend the Act to be such a paper tiger”―based on general acceptance that such information disclosure was a good thing.As described by Justice Marshall in a 1976 concurring opinion, the courts responded to “this vaguely worded statute” by “creat[ing]” “a ‘common law’ of NEPA,” which “is the source of NEPA’s success.”",

The Court stressed that “[i]ndeed, certain project opponents have relied on NEPA to fight even clean-energy projects―from wind farms to hydroelectric dams, from solar farms to geothermal wells.”It is a valid point. With the perception that NEPA may now be interfering with climate goals, a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2023 to amend the law, even if amending only part of the law makes little sense in light of the rest of the law left unchanged. Ironically, in the case ofSeven County, an immediate cost of NEPA’s cutback is a loss of EIS consideration of upstream and downstream impacts on climate change.",

But viewed not in isolation but in the broader context of our times, the ruling may well prove to be symptomatic of an ongoing devolving of environmental law. It is too soon to know for sure. That is necessarily true about discerning historical, evolutionary trends. No one isolated moment tells the full story. For those, however, who, like me, believe that environmental law has been one of law’s great success stories in the United States over the past half century, the suggestion of such an unraveling is discouraging.",

As described, it is being tested by the changing priorities of the current Supreme Court in areas of law that cross-cut with environmental law. It is being tested by a Congress that paradoxically passes a law that reduces environmental protections for the supposed purpose of addressing climate change more expeditiously but then fails to enact any substantive legislation directed to the climate issue itself. And, of course, it is being tested to an unprecedented extent by a President who, unable to erase the federal environmental statutes on the books, seeks to create a legal revolution akin to the antithesis of that which created environmental law in the 1970s―by destroying the federal government agencies’ ability to administer that law through massive freezing of previously appropriated funding, future budget cuts, layoffs, and destruction of career employee morale,and by relying on the Court’s recent rulings to justify eliminating all Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.TheSeven Countyopinion provides more reason still to worry with the obvious loss of much of the moral and legal force of one of the nation’s most important laws―NEPA.",

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order purportedly authorizing the President’s Council on Environmental Quality, which was itself created by NEPA, to issue such binding regulations.SeeExec. Order No. 11,991, 42 Fed. Reg. 26967 (May 24, 1977). For decades, CEQ did just that and the Court deferred within normal bounds to the CEQ regulations.SeeAndrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 357–58 (1979). More recently, however, some courts have called into question the validity of President Carter’s authority to confer on CEQ such rulemaking authority, Iowa v. Council on Env’t Quality, 765 F. Supp. 3d 859 (D.N.D. 2025), and President Trump has revoked that administrative order. Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8355 (Jan. 20, 2025). CEQ has in turn eliminated its CEQ regulations entirely,seeRemoval of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 10610 (Feb. 25, 2025) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. pts. 1500, 1501, 1502, 1503, 1504, 1506, 1507, 1508) (CEQ interim final rule), and agencies charged with complying with NEPA, like the Department of the Interior, have taken the further step of converting their own NEPA regulations into guidelines not published in the Code of Federal Regulations except for a few provisions intended to make NEPA compliance easier.SeeNational Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 29498 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 43 C.F.R. pt. 46) (Interior interim final rule). No doubt that is why neither of the two Supreme Court opinions inSeven Countyreference the CEQ NEPA regulations in force at the time of the Surface Transportation Board’s drafting of its EIS. Indeed, remarkably, neither opinion even refers to CEQ at all.↑",

To justify its holding that courts should defer to a federal agency’s decision on the proper boundaries for an EIS’s consideration of a proposed agency action’s environmental effects, the majority felt compelled to explain that the deference would not be to the agency’s legal interpretation of a statutory term within NEPA but instead “[f]or the most part” to the agency’sfactualdetermination of “what details need to be included in any given EIS.”SeeSeven Cnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle County, 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1512 (2025). According to the Court, “whether a particular report is detailed enough in a particular case itself requires the exercise of agency discretion―which should not be excessively second-guessed by a court.”Id.The majority analogizes this kind of judicial determination to “whether the agency action was reasonable and reasonably explained” as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, thereby warranting application of that same Act’s “deferential arbitrary-and-capricious” standard consistent withMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).Id.at 1511. As the Court’s inclusion of the caveat “for the most part” readily acknowledges, the distinction here ofLoper Brightis a bit messy. Sometimes an agency is not merely assessing facts. Its determination of what facts are relevant can naturally be framed as turning on a question of law, including the meaning of statutory terms such as “environmental effects” and “detailed” in NEPA. For this reason, some may viewSeven Countyas cutting back onLoper Bright, while others may viewSeven Countyas simply making clear the longstanding distinction between judicial review of statutory interpretation underChevronand judicial review of agency factual assessments underState Farm.↑",
