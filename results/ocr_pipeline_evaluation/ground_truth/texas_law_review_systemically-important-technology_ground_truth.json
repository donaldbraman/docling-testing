They could be catastrophic. Moreover, these failures will not necessarily occur where we expect. Seemingly small platforms may have disproportionate significance, and seemingly safe ones may fail through unanticipated interaction effects.",

It takes the best features of a resilience regime that successfully managed to pass a stern test during the COVID-19 pandemic and applies those features to a critical new part of the economy. In what follows, we make the case for the systemic importance of parts of the technology industry, outline the systemic-stability oversight regime in financial regulation, and describe how we would apply that model to technology.

It is difficult to imagine how most major businesses, universities, and K–12 schools could have functioned effectively without it during 2020–2021.Even as firms and schools return to in-person operations, they are continuing to use Zoom for meetings that previously would have been conducted in person.

There have been significant antitrust actions in the sector, such as the Department of Justice blocking the proposed merger of Visa and Plaid,but these are unconnected with systemic risk oversight. Market concentration is a factor in systemic risk—if there are many relatively small firms competing, it is unlikely the death of any of them would cause market-wide disruption.However, whether economic power is too concentrated in a market is a different question from whether risk is.

Classic public-utility regulation has been significantly reduced in communications and media industries in favor of a managed-competition approach.The contemporary derivative of those frameworks is network neutrality: the principle that internet platforms should not discriminate against unaffiliated traffic or devices.Essentially, the idea is that digital platforms should be open and fair for all who depend on them, rather than pure profit maximizers for proprietary wealth creation.Under this approach, regulation is typically conducted by a specialized expert agency, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).",

However, the characteristics of systemic risk in finance apply to a variety of scenarios. There is no reason these should necessarily be limited to financial markets. Such markets are necessarily interconnected because money is money; it is the representation of value, unit of account, and means of exchange across all firms and users. In an era of global digital networks and physical supply chains, however, finance may no longer be so exceptional.

      "text": "Financial regulation is different from other kinds of regulation in purpose and in style, partly because it emphasizes resilience and worries about interconnectedness. After reforms in the wake of the last financial crisis, the systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) model has passed a test during the pandemic with flying colors, a test that suggests to us that it offers an effective approach to resilience regulation. The more general alternative, Administrative Procedure Act (APA)-style administrative law, was devised in reference to adversarial relationships between a regulated industry and the agency that regulates it.The APA sets forth the rules of the road that agencies must use to make policy and affords industry and other interests a route to court if the agency fails to follow those rules.With environmental protection, or workplace safety, the paradigm is distributive rather than integrative. Costs not borne by the public are passed on to regulated industry, meaning that administrative law undergirds a contest in which judges are referees adjudicating the rationality and scientific soundness, or at least the process of identifying the scientific soundness, of government decisions to impose costs on businesses.",

The private firms that extend credit and safeguard deposits are performing a service that the governmentwantsto have performed, and so part of what the government does when it regulates finance is to encourage the development and reach of financial institutions.One of the functions of the Federal Reserve, for example, is to provide information to financial institutions through its research arm. It also provides institutions who run out of money, but are not insolvent, with loans. And it has longstanding relationships with its “primary dealers,” who stand ready to sell or buy government securities from the Federal Reserve when it wants to expand or contract the money supply.",

In the internet era, the question is whether firms that are traditionally regulated service providers, such as telephone and cable television companies, should nonetheless be subject to requirements based on their systemic importance. Internet service providers have significant power, which has led to efforts to impose network-neutrality requirements.However, because they are providers of the physical wiring or wireless connections between end-users and the internet, their scope is necessarily geographically limited.

The Fed’s interest in the area has grown but has longstanding roots. As Peter Conti-Brown and David Wishnick have put it:By the 1970s, the Fed not only had teams of technologists at the individual Reserve Banks but also had a specialized team dedicated to long-range telecommunications planning, which developed an early example of a packet-switched network as part of the Division of Data Services. Along with these investments in advanced infrastructure came investments in security and redundancy to prevent costly system outages. Today, the Fed is a large employer of cybersecurity personnel—witness the over one hundred analysts who comprise the National Incident Response Team, dedicated to responding to the highest-impact threats to the Federal Reserve System and the broader financial sector, especially those incidents that involve attempts to penetrate Fed computers.Peter Conti-Brown & David A.
