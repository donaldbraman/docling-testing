      "text": "Guns play a variety of roles in American life—as tools of crime and self-defense, political symbols, markers of individual identity, instruments of recreation, and more. But at the most basic level, guns are a technology designed to inflict violence, whether for good (as in justified self-defense) or for ill (as in criminal or negligent misuse). And because guns are so effective in that task, their prevalence helps account for the disproportionate deadliness of violence in the United States.In 2021, nearly 50,000 Americans died of gun shots—the highest number ever recorded by the CDC.Those harms are not randomly distributed—men and people of color are especially likely to die—and they come in different forms with different causes, including homicides,impulsive suicides,officer-involved killings,school shootings,and shootings by and of children (for whom gunshots are now the single leading cause of death).",

Ours is a violent society, but broadly speaking it is not more violent than other Western countries.What differentiates American violence is not violence’s pervasiveness but its severity—in any given violent encounter, Americans are much more likely to be killed or seriously injured, due to the prevalence of guns in those encounters.Scholars refer to this as the instrumentality effect,and have shown that, for example, gun robberies are three times more likely to result in death than knife robberies,and “.38 caliber attacks are more than twice as deadly as .22 caliber attacks.”One cannot understand or address this violence without accounting for the technology that intensifies it, and accordingly much of our analysis here will focus on firearms.",

It follows that violence technologies also encompass innovations designed to resist or mitigate the harms that weapons can inflict, such as bulletproof vests, metal detectors, and even bulletproof school desks.

We also show how one prominent effort to incentivize gun safety innovation—a smart gun requirement in New Jersey—generated such backlash that it likely hindered smart gun adoption rather than promoting it.

At the same time, some courts have been quick to extend constitutional protection to new and more-powerful forms of “Arms,” thus providing an asymmetric incentive to innovate new firearms while denying new means to regulate them.",

This same complication extends to violence technologies, because the power of an instrument to inflict violence has a deeply contested and fundamentally ambiguous relationship to public safety.Nearly all the features that make guns safety-enhancing from the perspective of some (for example as tools of self-defense) also make them dangerous (for example, as instruments of criminal, impulsive, or accidental violence).

The same is true of table saws, meat slicers, and even chemotherapy drugs.

It could be better trigger locks, or smart gun technology that renders guns responsive only to a registered owner, or a variety of other technological features designed to decrease the likelihood of a gun being misused in ways that harm either its owner or others. Our more fundamental interest is whether innovations in violence technology, whatever they might be, are likely to emerge in the current economic and legal environment. Such innovations are not “gun control”; they do not deprive anyone of a weapon, and in that sense are entirely consistent with the desire of some Americans to have and use guns for self-defense, while enhancing public safety overall. To return to LaPierre’s aphorism: Wouldn’t it be even better if the good guy is armed with a functional smart gun, while the bad guy’s stolen smart gun is locked because he is not an authorized user?",
