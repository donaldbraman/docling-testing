Real-Time Crime Centers have been promoted as the next evolution of law enforcement and promise a central surveillance hub of police intelligence to monitor big and small cities alike.",

This first step makes the convincing but limited claim that the question is still open for courts under existing Fourth Amendment doctrine, and the answer is certainly not compelled by precedent. The second step goes further, arguing that the Supreme Court’s recent cases on digital surveillance compel a finding that AI-assisted video analytics surveillance in Real-Time Crime Centers is a Fourth Amendment search. Specifically, I argue that the Supreme Court’s concern with long-term digital tracking through systems of mass surveillance inCarpenterv.

In addition, based on the success of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama2), innovators have begun creating similar models for object recognition using visual interference transformers.While still in development, these new techniques have proven quite effective at identifying images as particular objects.",

Common datasets exist that allow for object recognition training.Well-known datasets like COCO, ImageNet, or Pascal2 offer centralized training sets of all sorts of common images available to purchase.With the rise of machine-learning models, more options exist to train pattern-matching models on large datasets. As mentioned, new generative AI training systems are currently in development.Of course, concerns exist about having sufficient diversity and representative images in a dataset. For example, early facial recognition systems were trained on datasets of mostly white men, creating identification errors when applied to the task of matching Black and Brown women (or really anyone who did not fit the training data).Similarly, even labeling men, women, and children becomes fraught with choices that can distort the dataset; non-binary or non-conforming people might be excluded, and labeling age or gender identification can create unnecessary inconsistencies and inaccuracies.",

In recent years, other forms of face identification have emerged that look at skin textures, shadows, three-dimensional models, or some combination of all of these types.”Once faces are turned into a digital faceprint (like a digital fingerprint), they can be matched to a database of stored digital faceprints.Algorithms match the commonality of the probe photo to the database of photos and, as an output, produce a selection of close matches.With video surveillance, facial recognition is more complicated (and less reliable) because issues such as lighting, angle, and limited video quality can interfere with matching.Several false arrests have occurred using facial recognition.The result has been that video analytics companies have relied on more powerful neural networks to try to improve on accuracy for facial recognition.",

In holding that the police needed a warrant to listen to Katz’s conversation, the Supreme Court distinguished between the private nature of the phone call and Katz’s public presence in the phone booth.The Court held that a person could claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversation in a telephone booth because they had paid the toll to use the phone, but that they might not be able to claim an expectation of privacy from observations of their physical presence in the phone booth.In the Court’s words, “For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.”In other words, it might be reasonable to think that one’s phone call was not being listened to by police, but anyone (even police) could see someone using the phone with their own two eyes.",

By being in public, one can expect to be observed by human police officers. Especially in an era before digital surveillance systems, the only expectations of surveillance one might have reasonably had came from or was related to human beings. In 1967, if one wanted to guard one’s privacy, one could do so against existing human capabilities.

The analytics program is breaking down the image into classifiers—man, shirt, red shirt, pants, walking, hair color, direction, speed, time, date, etc. The analytics program saves that image within the larger dataset of every object captured by the cameras. The analytics program searches within its citywide system for similar matches of that particular red shirt and the red-shirted man (and other men wearing red shirts and all other men). The analytics program is searching to compare the object to whether it matches an anomaly trigger or unusual activity preprogrammed into the system. The dataset that is being searched is both all the collected video footage from the cameras (perhaps dating back weeks or months) and the dataset of training images that allows the system to identify the particular object or action in front of the screen. The analytics program has collected data to allow it to superimpose that red shirt and compare it across time and place. The geolocational part of the program tracks the red shirt (and all red shirts) through the city. The search can be through past days or weeks and can connect the dots of the activities of all red shirts over the course of months. The analytics program does it all instantly and accurately (for the most part).Inherent in the program are multiple (really, continuous) searches of past collected data, comparisons, analysis, and visualizations—all without the officer doing anything but turning on the system.",

It would be no less of a constitutional violation if police preprogrammed a computer program to hack my Wi-Fi and read the notes in my computer than if they did it in real time. In both, police are involved in the information collection process and cannot avoid constitutional scrutiny by simply preprogramming the intrusion for some time in the future.Similarly, it seems appropriate to hold police to account for the algorithmic systems they buy and deploy in cities.Police algorithms are not separate from police departments, and there is no independent non-law enforcement role of the algorithm itself deployed on police systems.

Each alert—if examined in isolation—might not reveal much, but in total, the constant object monitoring could be as revealing asJones’s GPS data orCarpenter’s CSLI records.Put another way, the preprogrammed and automated nature of the alert does not remove the invasion of privacy, even if isolated or targeted. If the system was preprogrammed automatically to alert to a Justice’s license plate, the time it captured the car outside the chemotherapy infusion center would be privacy-invasive. Or if a preprogrammed alert sounded for every time a Justice visited the home of a wealthy benefactor, it might reveal an associational connection that deserved privacy.
