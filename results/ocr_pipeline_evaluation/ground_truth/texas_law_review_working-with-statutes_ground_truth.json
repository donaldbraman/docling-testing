      "text": "In its 2024 decision overruling the decades-oldChevrondoctrine directing judges to accept an agency’s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language,the Supreme Court declared: “[A]gencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.”In this Article, we reveal this statement to be a profoundly blinkered assertion of judicial hubris. We present findings from a qualitative empirical study of how agencies work with the statutes that give them authority to act, showing that interpreting statutes to ensure that they have effect in the world is at the heart of agency competence.Loper Bright v. Raimondo,much like the Court’s recent supercharging of the “major questions doctrine,”rests on two flawed assumptions. The first separates legal interpretation and policymaking into two distinct enterprises—the former belonging to courts, the latter to political actors. The second posits that only Congress, not agencies, should make the important decisions that policymaking requires, on the theory that bureaucrats lack accountability or undermine democracy.",

Our study of the administrative state suggests not only that the line between law and policy cannot be consistently and constructively drawn, but also that values-driven interpretation and policymaking by agencies are central to our democratic system. Administrative agencies bring statutes to life; their policymaking represents our primary conduit for ensuring that the decisions of democratically elected officials are effectuated in practice.",

In so doing, we found inspiration in Jerry Mashaw’s recognition, two decades ago, that “[t]here are persuasive grounds for believing that legitimate techniques and standards for agency statutory interpretation diverge sharply from the legitimate techniques and standards for judicial statutory interpretation.”But while Mashaw urged scholars to investigate those differences,much work in this area remains theoretical and adopts prescriptive frameworks developed for courts as a baseline against which to evaluate, or imagine, agency action.The relatively few empirically oriented studies that investigate agency statutory interpretation also typically accept judicial doctrines and interpretive tenets as the points of departure.But judicial interpretation theories tend to be prescriptive rather than empirical.A juricentric orientation also implies that courts sit at the heart of the democratic administration of the laws—a highly debatable proposition. The dominance of the juricentric model has meant that courts and commentators continue to opine on agency decisionmaking without confronting the realities of administration; it has also arguably contributed to judges’ blithe assertions that determining the meaning of statutes amounts to a legal question belonging primarily, even exclusively, to courts.",

We find that agencies’ self-conception and behavior can be constructively described as adhering to a pair of concepts from private law: the duty of loyalty and the duty of care. As custodians of a statute, agencies understand themselves to have a general duty to act in the statute’s interest: They are loyal to their statutory regimes, rather than to an imagined unitary Congress or public. And agencies act on their duty of care by bringing together the perspectives and information offered by multiple actors in and out of government to produce reasonable, workable policies. These concepts, though stylized, help capture the aspirations and actions our interviewees discussed.",

We take a more empirical tack. Our interviews indicate that many agency personnel describe their work in ways that comport with the fiduciary model without using that terminology. Numerous agency personnel share a role morality that befits a public fiduciary, giving an empirical basis for public fiduciary theory’s normative arguments.",

Mission is a cultural factor in agency work, an enduring yet evolving influence over the agency’s role that channels and shapes discretionary decisionmaking. But while mission has a goal-infused quality, being guided by mission does not mean that agencies are purposivist as understood within juricentric theory.Purposivism (like textualism) is an “archeological” approach to interpretation that assumes a statute’s “meaning . . . is set in stone on the date of its enactment, and it is the interpreter’s task to uncover and reconstruct that original meaning.”Agencies, in contrast, seek to ensure that a statute remains relevant and efficacious through social, legal, and political changes, sometimes over lengthy periods.The sense of mission we found was rooted in the statute but not coterminous with its text or even its enacting context—it evolved over time.",

An agency, after all, cannot make policy on its own: Agencies are not just structured by internal divisions of labor, but subject to external ones as well. More than one agency often has a say in any given process, and agencies with differing missions will bring differing normative considerations and practical concerns to bear. This pluralistic phenomenon may arise by congressional design and create productive counterweights within the policymaking process, but it can also impede agencies’ custodial abilities by enabling one agency’s mission to run roughshod over others’. Text and mission ultimately focus officials on the interests of the statutory regime itself—not quite the same thing as the Congress that enacted the statute, nor the Congress that currently oversees the agency’s work, nor a presidential administration past or present.",

We then spell out the institutional, political, and doctrinal implications of the picture we see. Agencies frequently serve as sites for democratic contestation, making them as central to channeling popular sentiments and promoting social welfare as the political bodies that create and oversee them. This work, our research shows, is pluralistic and contestatory; it takes into account policies’ consequences and workability; it combines expertise and experience with political influence and public pressures; and it is grounded in authority granted by elected officials. But because agencies retain responsibility for their regulatory regimes well beyond the tenure of any statute-enacting coalition, their statutory work also helps connect successive political regimes and real-world developments, balancing interests in stability and change. This balancing gives rise to tensions, even potentially irreconcilable differences, between views of what a statute should be—between historical and contemporary understandings. These tensions are not just pesky incidentals; they are a central fact of democratic governance, which requires respecting the enactments of past governing coalitions as well as the needs and interests of the people statutes govern in the present.Agency work with statutes thus offers one essential way our system of government addresses the dead-hand problem presented by legal enactments.",

But we think that our study helps to substantiate that, from a comparative institutional perspective, no other United States government institution equals agencies’ capacity for the effectuation of statutes. The Supreme Court’s evolving administrative law doctrines, though cloaked in the language of balanced powers, actually channel decisions about both general delegation and specific policy to the courts.But, lacking capacity, courts are not up to the job. Agencies’ ongoing, pluralistic practices make them the superior institutional choice for the foundational aspects of democratic governance the Court increasingly arrogates to itself. All of this suggests that, while judicial doctrine and political discourse often denigrate and undermine agency work, the capabilities we bring to light should be recognized and strengthened, not dismissed, by future courts and Congresses.

We thus illuminate the realities of the institutional context the Court’s doctrinal trends target but distort. We underscore the political stakes of these supposedly purely legal interventions—political stakes that Congress, presidential administrations, and lower courts, as well as the broader public, should acknowledge.

We mostly asked respondents about their experiences rather than their opinions, using open-ended phrasings to encourage participants to form answers in their own terms, instead of agreeing or disagreeing with ours.

Rather than settling the meaning of a particular word or the details of a specific policy, officials spoke of agency mission as providing a general value orientation that influenced how they approached their policy choices, without determining the conclusions they would come to. While certainly not the exclusive source of officials’ purpose or motivation, mission operated as a rudder to steer agencies’ work with their statutes and gave their work a rough coherence over time.",

Specific statutory language or a foundational committee report may define a clear mission that carries through all of the agency’s work. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which created the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), itself articulated the Act’s overarching mission: “to protect the health and safety of the Nation’s coal miners.”Congress passed the statute as a direct response to a massive underground mine explosion, and the statute’s supporting committee report clearly articulated a vision repeated by President Nixon upon signing the bill—that it was “a crucially needed step forward in the protection of America’s coal miners.”MSHA officials in our study described that mission as permeating the agency’s work and its officials’ self-conception. “[E]verybody I work with is very focused on mine safety. The legislative history specifically says everything should be interpreted, when in doubt, on the side of mine safety. I sort of take that command from Congress. It’s nothing that would need to be said.”This explicit “unidirectional mandate”makes MSHA decisionmaking “always about safety, and health, and . . . how best to promote safety and health within . . . the possible range of interpretations.”",

We want to do it in a way that . . . is as efficient and least burdensome as can be based on the language of the statute.”We heard that kind of overarching, general, and relatively simple sense of mission repeatedly in our interviews, often in the course of an official explaining some particular process or decision. “Sort of the unifying thing about [a particular agency],” another subject said, is that all parts of it are “very much focused on preventing harm to [a particular group].”As another person put it, “[W]e’re dealing with a very mission-oriented agency, an agency that thinks if the air is cleaner we’re doing a good job, not like if [some] company has higher profits we’re doing a good job.”Officials might ask in a “broad sense, what is the statute trying to do? Maybe it’s trying to clean up the air and water and if so, then let’s lean in that direction.”Another spoke in terms of a statute’s overarching purpose: to “best serve the Medicare beneficiaries because ultimately that’s what Medicare’s there to serve.

Statutes, after all, construct complex environments with many competing priorities: Any given provision’s instruction can be read in a number of ways.

Members of Congress provide inputs into a multifarious decisionmaking process with agencies, though members’ authority or political preferences, rather than expertise, shape such “assistance.”As one interviewee put it, when members of Congress lobbied their agency to adopt some particular view of a statutory provision, “we would certainly take it under advisement whether we could do it or not, whether we thought it made sense of what we’re trying to accomplish, and whether it could be done legally with all the issues that we’d have to evaluate.”In the end, though, the statute took primacy: If some option is not “permissible in terms of certain things that maybe certain members of Congress want you to do, you just have to deal with it and say, ‘The law is the law here.

And regardless of the extent to which the President and White House can and should control agency action, EOP support remains vital to the success of many agency policies, including because of the entrenched practices of centralized OMB and OIRA review.

Agencies thus possess a clear comparative advantage when addressing day-to-day problems and evolving demands for government action.

We then asked about the role of Congress (including congressional intent, legislative history, and consultation with Congress); other sources or methods for statutory interpretation; and the roles of other agencies, the White House, states, and the public. We also asked about the role of courts (including prospective consideration of litigation risk, litigation practices and outcomes, judicial doctrines likeChevron, and interpretive theories like textualism and purposivism). We invited interviewees to explain in their own terms how they thought about statutory interpretation and implementation. We also asked whether our questions elicited what they thought was relevant about the work they did and whether there were other questions we should ask.",

We adjusted the interview protocol somewhat for each interview, pursuing the leads interviewees offered and spending more or less time on particular topics depending on what interviewees regarded as important in their work. Where possible, we also tailored interviews to interviewees’ particular backgrounds and the projects they had worked on (which we asked about when setting up interviews). This helped us ground our questions in specific interviewee experiences, which are often easier to talk about and more revealing of actual practices than abstract or conceptual discussions. Our interview protocol also developed over time as subjects suggested relevant questions or pointed us to more productive ways of pursuing an inquiry.",

It allows interviewees to focus on a particular experience they have gone through and describe it, then examine whether they feel it was unusual in the context of their broader experience. That takes pressure off the interviewee to provide a neat or universal description of a process that may be complex or variable, and it helps us get at the particularities of participants’ experiences of working in the agency. It also lays the ground for follow-up questions that are easier to formulate and to answer, since we can ask about the particular experiences the interviewee has already described.Often, we would come back to particular situations an interviewee had discussed as we went through the interview, using interviewees’ descriptions as an anchor for further conversation.",

The coding process also gave us an ambient sense of the material and helped us identify the topic areas where our diverse respondents’ discussions converged to reveal underappreciated aspects of agencies’ work with statutes. Of course, no single methodology or study could reveal all that is important about administration. We hope our research spurs more empirical work, using diverse methodologies, to illuminate the complex operations of our government.",
