      "text": "The Supreme Court has appliednoscitur a sociis, often called the associated words canon, in many notable decisions--including the recentFischer v. United States.This canon has a longstanding history in American jurisprudence, but interpreters face challenges in finding a common theme among words or phrases and supporting it with surrounding context. And some scholars argue judges can usenosciturto bring in external policy preferences and ideological beliefs. This Note proposes several steps to guide the use ofnosciturand, by extension, its cousinejusdem generis, including the clear identification of an association and multiple common themes and principles for transparent contextual analysis. These steps can shield judges from the appearance of guesswork or ideologically influenced decisions and encourage more accurate results by providing a clear roadmap of these canons' proper application. They may also bring interpreters of all methodologies closer to their interpretive goals.",
