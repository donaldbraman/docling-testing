(That is, it did not charge former President Donald J. Trump with the crime of engaging in insurrection.) Then Section Three suddenly was discovered by two distinguished originalist scholars.It blazed across the skies of courts and headlines, and it went to the Supreme Court, where two other important scholars declared it “perhaps one of the most important cases in American history.”Then it disappeared from public attention as rapidly as it had appeared. Section Three was the Halley’s Comet of constitutional law.",

Fingers were crossed for a repeat from 2023 to 2024, with former President Trump stepping in for the role of Harold. Supporters of Mr. Trump had forcibly entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021, threatened violence against Vice President Mike Pence and others, and delayed the counting of the electoral votes for more than five hours, spurred on by Mr. Trump’s false claims that the election had been stolen.Mr. Trump was not physically present at the Capitol incursion, but he had egged on the rioters at a rally nearby, with perfunctory admonitions to remain peaceful. Could it be said that the three-hour lawless disruption of congressional proceedings was an “insurrection” and that Mr. Trump “engaged in” it? If so, Mr. Trump’s detractors thought, he could be stricken from the ballot and the danger of a second Trump presidency eliminated without need for consulting the voters.",

Not a single Justice—whether appointed by Republican or by Democratic Presidents—accepted the argument that Section Three kept the former President off the ballot. In an unsigned per curiam opinion joined by five Justices, accompanied by a concurrence by Justice Barrett and another concurrence by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, the Court reversed the Colorado Supreme Court and held that states have no authority to enforce Section Three with respect to presidential candidates without empowerment by Congress, which has not been granted.As a practical matter, because states control presidential electoral machinery, that rendered the effort to bar Mr. Trump from running for President defunct. Section Three then disappeared from the news as rapidly as it had appeared.The idea that Mr. Trump is constitutionally disqualified dropped even from his opponents’ campaign oratory.

Six of the nine Justices were appointed by Republican Presidents, three of them by Mr. Trump himself, and three by Democrats. Yet all nine agreed that neither Colorado nor any other state could keep Mr. Trump off the ballot, even assuming he had “engaged in” an “insurrection” within the meaning of the Constitution—a contentious question that the Court, unsurprisingly, preferred to avoid. The reason for this unanimous outcome was almost certainly pragmatic rather than textual or historical. As Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson stated in concurrence, “Allowing Colorado to [keep a presidential candidate off the ballot on the ground that he is an oathbreaking insurrectionist] would, we agree, create a chaotic state-by-state patchwork, at odds with our Nation’s federalism principles.”The simple and unanimous holding of the case was that States have no role in enforcing Section Three with respect to the presidency.",

The Justices were not willing to deprive tens of millions of people of their right to vote for the candidate of their choice for anything less than clear and reasonably indisputable reasons; much less on the basis of a Delphic piece of text that had never been raised in connection with any presidential election or previously interpreted by the Court.

Justice Barrett says that the per curiam opinion “address[ed] the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.”The other concurring Justices assert that the per curiam opinion “announces that a disqualification for insurrection can occur only when Congress enacts a particular kind of legislation pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.”“In doing so,” they continue, “the majority shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement.”But those words do not appear in the per curiam opinion. At no point does the majority plainly state that Section Three can be enforced only by means of Section Five legislation. To be sure, the per curiam opinion contains language that stronglyhintsat that conclusion. It states that “[t]he Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how those determinations should be made.Therelevant provision is Section 5, which enables Congress, subject of course to judicial review, to pass ‘appropriate legislation’ to ‘enforce’ the Fourteenth Amendment.”The direct article “the” might be taken to suggest that Section Five is theonlyrelevant provision. The per curiam opinion added that “Congress’s Section 5 power is critical when it comes to Section 3.”What does “critical” mean? Does it mean “exclusive”?To state that Section Five is “the” relevant provision and that it is “critical” to enforcement of Section Three does not—quite—say that Section Three cannot be enforced in any other way. Finally, the per curiam observes that the judicial gloss on Section Five announced inCity of Boerne v. Flores—that Section Five legislation limiting state power must “reflect ‘congruence and proportionality’ between preventing or remedying that conduct ‘and the means adopted to that end’”—“limitscongressionallegislation enforcing Section 3.”Surely the Court did not mean to suggest that theBoernegloss applies to congressional powers outside Section Five, or to state power. What, then, was the point of referring to “congruence and proportionality”?",

Musings? Decisions? Shutdowns? There are a number of reasons, canvassed below, to doubt that the majority meant to hold that Section Five is the exclusive vehicle for enforcement of Section Three.

Here is the kicker: Perhaps the Justices ran out of time to work things out. For obvious reasons, the Court must have felt the need to issue the opinion before the Colorado primary, so that the voters of Colorado would know for sure whether votes for Mr. Trump would count. Under this speculative narrative of what might have happened, the majority removed any clear holding about the need for Section Five legislation, but did not have time to scrub the opinion for the remaining suggestive language; this was enough to goad the concurring Justices into their acrimonious separate opinion, and Justice Barrett into her frustrated rebuke of both sides. Or maybe it was the concurring Justices who did not have time to revise their work in light of the changes in the majority. In other words, the rush to issue an opinion before the Colorado primary prevented the Justices from coming together on a single unanimous text.

In some cases, the challenged individuals were seated and in other cases they were disqualified.The jurisdiction of the two Houses to make these determinations was unchallenged—even though no Section Five legislation authorized the proceedings.

Kennedy, Jr. was on the ballot in some states and off the ballot in others (until he withdrew from the race); the same was true of Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Independent candidate Cornel West.Whether a third-party candidate is on the ballot can profoundly affect the outcome of the election—not just for one state but for the country.

Anderson, even if all nine Justices said so. But that does not mean the holding is wrong. The per curiam’s second rationale, resting squarely on the Fourteenth Amendment itself, has more substance. The Fourteenth Amendment is a nationalizing amendment to its toes: It nationalizes the definition of citizenship; it nationalizes the basic set of constitutional rights (“privileges or immunities”) pertaining to citizens; it nationalizes the rule of law principles of due process; it creates for the first time a constitutional requirement of equality, which is national; it protects the national credit and discountenances the Confederate debt; and it gives the national legislature broad power to enforce all of that, with the ability to preempt inconsistent state law. Section Three is part and parcel of the Amendment’s nationalizing project. Its clear purpose was to limit the ability of the states of the rebellion to re-empower officials who had betrayed their oaths of office. As legal historian Gerard Magliocca expresses it, the Framers of Section Three “embraced a theory that the political and military elites of the South were the only people who should bear constitutional responsibility for the Civil War. In making that judgment, … Congress limited a state’s ability to choose its leaders and would force some of them to clean house.”",

These provisions were repealed decades later, on the apparent assumption that Section Three had no more relevance after Congress passed the Amnesty Act in 1872.These provisions applied to judges (and other judicial officers, such as clerks and marshals) and executive branch officers. By their terms, they did not apply to legislative positions.

John H. Christy of Georgia admitted to giving “aid, countenance, counsel, and encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility” against the Union.Interestingly, as the per curiam opinion pointed out in a footnote, the Governor had refused to commission Christy on Section Three grounds, which is the only known example of a state authority attempting to enforce Section Three against a federal officeholder. Christy nonetheless presented his credentials to the House in Washington, and the House made the final decision as to his eligibility. Christy’s replacement, John A. Wimpy, was also disqualified. Wimpy had taken up arms as a soldier in the Confederate Army and thus was an easy case.Two elected House members were seated despite claims that they had supported the insurrection. A Virginian, Lewis McKenzie, was permitted to take his seat in the House despite voting in favor of secession as a pre-war member of Virginia’s House of Delegates and voting to appropriate funds to ready the State for armed hostilities with the Union.The distinction appears to be that he did not take up arms, and thus did not “engage in” the rebellion. Similarly, John M. Rice of Kentucky was permitted to take his seat, despite having voted for secession as a member of his state legislature. Rice also had been a recruiter for the Confederate Army but not himself a participant.While some House members thought these actions were disloyal and qualified as aid and comfort to the enemy, the full House voted to seat him.Perhaps more strangely, the House voted to seat former Confederate Officer Alfred Waddell. Waddell had been the master of chancery in North Carolina before the war, an office which required him to take an oath to support the Constitution. Waddell’s supporters argued that the state office was not “judicial in character,” because it was a “clerical appointment,” and thus that he had not taken an oath covered by Section Three.

That is not as obvious as it may seem. There are oddities in the language of Section Three that cast doubt on whether it applies to the presidency. Both the trial court and dissenting Justice Samour in the Colorado Supreme Court relied on these linguistic peculiarities in rejecting the case for disqualifying President Trump, and they were joined by amici in the Supreme Court including three former attorneys general,and supported by research published by several scholars with expertise in these matters.Their argument is as follows: Section Three bars violators from holding “any office, civil or military,underthe United States… .”They present evidence that the language “under the United States” is a term of art that, in the original Constitution, meant only appointed offices, which would suggest that the Framers of Section Three might not have understood that phrase to apply to future Presidents. Section Three uses different terminology in reference to the violator’s past office, when he or she took the oath. There, it says “officerofthe United States,” which is used elsewhere in the Constitution in contexts that exclude the presidency.For example, the Commission Clause provides that “[t]he President … shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.”The President does not commission himself. Similarly, the Appointments Clause provides that the President shall appoint “all … Officers of the United States.”He does not appoint himself; the electors do that. This suggests that the term “Officers of the United States” might apply only to appointed positions, not to elected ones, and not to the presidency or vice presidency. Finally, the Section applies to persons who took an oath “to support the Constitution of the United States.”This language echoes the oath prescribed in Article VI, Section Three,but Article II, Section One, Clause Eight prescribes a different oath for the President: He swears to “protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”",

The only former President who supported the Confederacy, John Tyler, died in 1862, and it was politically inconceivable that a supporter of the rebellion could win a nationwide election. It was logically assumed that Section Three would have its practical effect in elections in Southern states, where the possibility that a participant in the rebellion could prevail in an election was anything but unlikely.

Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson give the example of “when a party is prosecuted by an insurrectionist and raises a defense on that score.”In other contexts —usually separation of powers—parties to administrative proceedings have been permitted to challenge administrative action on the ground that their agency adversary was improperly appointed.",

Unlike the electoral-vote-counting scenario, an attempt to enforce Section Three by disqualifying an officer will necessarily take place within the courts, where the case will quickly go to the Supreme Court, which has already expressed its opposition. To be sure, those comments in the per curiam opinion wereobiter dictum, but if a case involving an actual disqualification issue goes to the Court, there is little doubt how it would be resolved.",

First, the nature of the case presupposes that the alleged oath-breaking insurrectionist won the election, that the results of that election were recognized by Congress in its proceedings under the Twelfth Amendment, and that he or she has been sworn into office. There will be a strong argument that the Section Three issue has already been decided by appropriate political authorities. Even if the legitimacy of the officeholder’s appointment is not technically a “political question” outside the jurisdiction of the courts, there will be a powerful judicial impulse to defer to those prior political decisions.",

Even if a few of these proceedings succeed, there is no reason to think that the putative Presidents or their appointees would resign as a result. The courts would have no authority to depose either the Presidents or their appointees, but at most to set aside the particular agency action. (Even then, under the de facto officer doctrine, the courts might well refuse to take that step.)

A criminal defendant was convicted in a court proceeding where the presiding state judge had been an open Confederate supporter. One federal judge granted the convicted man habeas corpus relief on the ground that the judge was not eligible to preside, based on Section Three. That decision was reversed on appeal, largely on the pragmatic ground that, at least in the context of a collateral challenge to a criminal conviction, “it must be ascertained what particular individuals are embraced by the definition [of engaging in an insurrection], before any sentence of exclusion can be made to operate.”The court went on: “To accomplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable; and these can only be provided for by congress.”",

It was written by Chief Justice Chase, a prominent abolitionist who presumably was deeply immersed in the legal questions around Reconstruction and politically allied with the leading players. Chase was in as good a position to know how the new Amendment was expected to work as anyone—certainly better than we are today. Even though some current commentators are critical of the opinion,there is no evidence that it was regarded as surprising or misguided at the time.Moreover, much of the criticism directed at the opinion is predicated on its supposed inconsistency with Chase’s opinion in the matter of Jefferson Davis’s prosecution for treason—but if there was inconsistency, it is more likely that his view on the law of treason was wrong than thatGriffin’s Casewas wrong.",

Anderson. The attempt to disqualify Mr. Trump from running for President in 2024 deeply divided the nation. Was Section Three the hoped-for silver bullet that would rid the nation’s political life of this oath-breaking insurrectionist for all time? Or was it yet another legal maneuver to rob the People of their right to choose the leader of their choice? It depended on whom you asked. But the Supreme Court did not divide. Despite its reputation for partisan division, the nine Justices unanimously held that these efforts to use the Constitution to disqualify Mr. Trump were contrary to our federal system and unanimously reversed the state supreme court decision expelling Mr. Trump from the ballot. Unfortunately, however, this unanimity was spoiled by strong hints in the majority’s per curiam opinion that Congress is limited in its enforcement of Section Three to statutes passed pursuant to Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that post-election enforcement is illegitimate. If they were true, this would cut off other avenues for enforcement, including Congress’s power to count electoral votes under the Twelfth Amendment. These suggestions, which were unnecessary to decide the case and very likely wrong as a textual and historical matter, angered the three Democrat-appointed Justices, leading them to accuse the majority of trying to insulate “the petitioner” (Mr. Trump) from the constitutional consequences of his actions.",

In particular, the notion that Section Three cannot be enforced at the federal level without Section Five legislation is refuted by the practice of disqualifying would-be members of Congress under Article I, Section Five. And the notion that Section Three can be enforced only before the election flies in the face of the plain text of the provision, which forbids an oath-breaking insurrectionist to “hold” office—something that takes place only after the election.
