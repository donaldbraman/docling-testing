      "text": "Jailhouse lawyering enables incarcerated persons throughout our nation to access the court system as pro se litigants, but self-represented litigants face detrimental barriers to obtaining justice. A partnership between prisoners filing pro se and appointed attorneys is essential to bridge the gap between the vast resources of the State and those of prisoners, equipped with perseverance, ingenuity, and often only electric typewriters or ballpoint pen fillers. Professional advocacy by attorneys and large firms provides prisoners with commensurate resources and lessens the constraints of preparing pleadings and conducting legal research while incarcerated. The collaboration between attorneys and prisoners allows for the professional presentation of novel arguments backed with supporting evidence produced within prison walls.",

      "text": "Despite the administrative and systemic obstacles that constrain pro se lawyering, a group of lifers in San Quentin State Prison were able to expose the Board of Parole Hearings’ de facto “no parole” policy by flooding the system with habeas petitions. They unveiled the Board’s invariable denial of parole for commitment offenses based on the “egregiousness” of the crime, in contravention of the statute requiring that parole shall normally be granted. These San Quentin lifers asserted their right to individualized consideration—ultimately receiving parole on their life sentences. Their litigation encompassed First and Eighth Amendment violations and held the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) accountable for falsification of evidence in prison felony prosecutions and mistreatment of prisoners living withHIVand physical and mental disabilities. The accounts of these pro se litigants inform present-day post-conviction, section 1170(d)resentencing efforts, which often fail to contextualize a prisoner’s incarceration record within the abyss of prison life that is “not exactly an ideal therapeutic environment to say the least.”Resentencing courts lack the insurgent knowledge of the brutality and dysfunction of prisons that traumatizes most prisoners. If presented with this insurgent knowledge in a way that they could fully understand, judges would likely conclude that “continued incarceration is no longer in the interest of justice.”",

I spent most of my time lifting weights and had a job as a clerk for the Security and Investigations Unit, which investigates prison felonies including assaults and homicides. In 1989, I assisted a prisoner, Dae Won Park, who was born and raised in Korea and could not write fluently in English, to document the mistreatment of handicapped patients in the Physical Therapy Clinic atCMF. Amputees and other patients were routinely denied physical therapy by indolent staff. In retaliation for his complaint exposing abuse of handicapped prisoners, Park was transferred, and I was placed in Willis Unit, otherwise known as administrative segregation and commonly referred to as “the hole,” and falsely charged with a murder-conspiracy. While in Willis Unit, Anthony P. Kane, theCMFInvestigative Services Lieutenant who was later promoted to Warden and Commissioner on the Board of Parole Hearings, placed me in a disciplinary detention cell. This area of administrative segregation is reserved for punishment and limited confinement to a ten-day maximum stay under Title 15.I was held there for fifty-one consecutive days while also being deprived of yard time, showers, my personal property, and a mattress. Fortuitously, lawyers from the Prison Law Office were touring Willis Unit while working on a federal civil rights lawsuitchallenging the mistreatment of prisoners living withHIVand who had disabilities. Upon calling out to them, I informed them that I was being held in disciplinary detention in violation of Title 15.

My motivation then was simply to help prisoners who could not read or write or properly fill out an administrative appeal form. I never disclosed that I had any legal training, and it was not until years later when Rico received a parole date as a result of the writ we filed and he was waiting for the date to be approved, that I confided in him. I filed group and individual appeals that succeeded in inundating the Appeals Office and required staff to respond. The confluence of the active lawsuit in federal court and our efforts to address our grievances through appeals and protests within the unit, which included daily flooding on the housing floors known as tiers and setting fires, placed significant pressure on the staff running Willis Unit, primarily the Associate Warden. In addition to reaching a settlement in the Sacramento lawsuit, the success of our resistance was apparent from the succession of Unit Lieutenants and Associate Wardens stepping down or being reassigned following the initiation of this mass protest.",

Judges often give no thought to the reliability of these confidential sources when deciding whether to grant a prisoner resentencing. Correctional officers gave the informants in my case my boom box (a valuable commodity at the time) and other property as an incentive. One of the informants told his attorney that he knew nothing about me but was pressured to name me. The attorney advised me that he would not represent the informant if he testified against me because the testimony was false. Informants used in investigating prison homicides atCMFwere given photo ducats, which are officially used to take photos in the visiting room but could be used as prison money to purchase TVs and radios.

The same language that the Board used to deny me parole—stating that my crime was “particularly cruel and egregious and showed a callous disregard for human suffering” and was “exceptional”—was used verbatim in his decision. By documenting in a habeas petition that this standardized language is used to deny parole without regard to individual commitment offenses,we were granted an Order to Show Cause (OSC) from Marin County Superior Court,which eventually issued a writ granting Rico another hearing where he was found suitable for parole.

We argued in both state and federal courts that there must be a continuum of egregiousness—not every murder in California could be exceptional. Mike was able to get discovery ordered on his petition challenging the Board’s denial of parole. His appointed attorney, Jacob Burland, assembled a team of law students and a statistician to demonstrate how the Board used this “exceptional cruelty” standard to deny parole in virtually every case for commitment offenses without evaluating the individualized circumstances for parole suitability. I obtained similar discovery in federal court and was assisted by attorney Keith Wattley in filing a class action against the Board.Through the influx of petitions, courts were able to see how a Board denial of parole premised on the crime being exceptional did not qualify as individualized consideration, but rather a scripted denial given in virtually every hearing for commitment offenses.",

His parole date was rescinded because of a disciplinary report issued to him after he, Mike Ngo, Eddie Zheng, and I signed a petition requesting ethnic studies classes in the San Quentin College Program, which had denied Dylan Rodríguez and other professors permission to teach classes in San Quentin because their writings were too radical, and they opposed incarceration. Mike was my cellie, Rico and Eddie were my workout partners, and we all attended college classes. We asserted our belief that if the college program was based on critical thinking and academic freedom, other professors and teachers in the program should not hold the power to censor and restrict what knowledge was accessible to us. Our proposal for the college program, which garnered support from the Asian Prisoner Support Committee,was controversial among prisoners and came to the attention of the San Quentin Public Information Officer, Lieutenant Neinhieus, who was responsible for the security of the program. He ordered the Security and Investigation Squad to search our cells and seize our paperwork and photos in an effort to dissuade and divide. He was unsuccessful. He then interviewed us individually, having found football betting slips in my property, and told me he was not interested in the gambling but rather, why we signed a proposal for ethnic studies in the college program. I told him that if he was not making an issue of the gambling, then I would not make an issue of his actions violating my First Amendment rights. Lieutenant Neinhieus became irate, fulminating, “How am I violating your rights?” After repeating his question and eventually calming down, I explained: “There is a lot in Title 15 that I do not like or agree with. But as much as I might not like or agree with a rule, if I violate it, there are consequences. The same with the Constitution. You may not like or agree with it, but it gives me the right to free speech. And if you violate that right, there are consequences.”",

This policy also facilitated the use of race-based punishment and lockdowns. Mike filed a claim in Marin County protesting this classification system and the strict racial segregation it caused, and later obtained the assistance of another ally, attorney Charles Carbone, who represented me at my parole hearing at which I was found suitable for release in 2012. I filed a civil rights action in federal court in the Northern District of California and settled withCDCR, which changed my racial classification category from “White” to “Other” based on my Lithuanian-Turkish ancestry. I objected to being classified as “White” due to my Jewish heritage and the resulting, involuntary segregation into a group that espoused white supremacy and used swastikas. Ephraim Margolin and later James Brosnahan of Morrison & FoersterLLPtook on this case in the Northern District. Brosnahan graciously represented me at my early parole hearings and later won a decision in federal court holding that there was no evidence of unsuitability at my 2009 Board hearing where I was denied parole. Judge Wilken ordered a new hearing, holding that, in the absence of additional evidence, I was to be found suitable.While the case was on appeal in the Ninth Circuit,the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no federally protected interest in parole.So I focused on doing everything within my control to be found suitable for parole by the Board. By 2009, the Board was finding more lifers in San Quentin as suitable for parole and the governor was increasingly allowing them to keep these hearing dates and go home.Freedom seemed attainable.",

      "text": "The trajectory of these efforts reveals the essential advocacy of appointed attorneys who are dedicated to our common mission and willing to expend the necessary resources and effort to properly represent our cases in court. In Mike Ngo’s experience, as a pro per prisoner who lacked formal legal education and practiced as a jailhouse lawyer, working with appointed attorneys not only garnered the respect of the courts, but also significantly increased such prisoners’ access to the justice system through increased legal resources, expertise, and formal filings and briefs, which he later modeled his own pro per actions on. Before reaching the threshold at which point a pro per petitioner is appointed representation, prisoners are plagued by unrealistic disparities in accessing the court system. Many prisoners do not read and write English and lack knowledge of the legal system. Those with this acumen have to overcome substantial legislative barriers such as the vague and burdensome Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) requirements andCDCRbarriers such as limited access to the law library, confiscation of legal books and documents, and other forms of retaliation by correctional officers designed to intimidate prisoners to abandon their efforts. Upon being appointed an attorney, these San Quentin lifers encountered many who did not share the same concerns to strive for their agency rather than folding in the face of systemic disparities. In addition to the barriers for pro per litigants to retain appointed counsel, finding attorneys who can match the passion of these litigants fighting for their freedom presents further challenges. In the words of Mike Ngo, his induction into legal practice through pro per initiatives “planted a seed in him” during a time of despair in his life. Jailhouse lawyering provided purpose in his life at a LevelIIIprison, where he chose to “bring agency to [his] allies and fellow inmates who have never had it before.”",

Governor Pete Wilson (1991–1999), the first Governor to implement the new measure, rejected only 27 percent of grants, although he only considered a handful of cases. Governor Gray Davis (1999–2003)—who claimed he would not parole a single convicted murderer—reversed virtually all the grants during his term. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (2003–2011) reversed about 60 percent of grants, while remanding about 20 percent to the Board of Parole Hearings for further review (though . . . the reversal rate within his term fluctuated). In his first few months in office, Governor Jerry Brown has reversed at the lowest rate of the three Governors. The Davis Administration is likely to remain a sharp anomaly—a virtual nullification of the law—since the Proposition 89 procedure was arguably designed as a kind of appellate review by the Governor.",

The Board is dedicated to protecting public safety, treating all persons who participate in a parole hearing with respect and dignity, applying the law in an unbiased manner, and protecting the rights of inmates and victims. The Board conducts parole suitability hearings for a variety of inmates who are sentenced to lengthy prison terms, including: Inmates sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, commonly referred to as life-term inmates or “lifers,” once they have served a certain amount of time based on the sentence imposed by the court[;] Inmates sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for a nonviolent offense under an alternative sentencing scheme, such as the state’s Three Strikes Law, once they have served a certain amount of time based on their commitment offenses[;] Youth offenders—inmates who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense, who have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, depending on the sentence imposed by the court, and who are eligible for a youth offender hearing[;] Inmates who are age 60 or older, who have served 25 years of continuous incarceration, and who are eligible for the state’s elderly parole program. The purpose of a parole suitability hearing is to determine if an inmate should be released from prison. Parole suitability hearings are usually conducted in-person at the prison where the inmate is located. However, inmates serving their California prison sentence in another state may have their parole hearing conducted by telephone or via videoconference.
