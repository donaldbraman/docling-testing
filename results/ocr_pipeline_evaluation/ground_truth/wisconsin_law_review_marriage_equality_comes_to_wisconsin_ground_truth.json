[not] ‘deeply rooted’ in the country’s legal tradition at the time.”She found thatGlucksberg“involved the question whether a right to engage in certain conduct . . . should be expanded to include a right to engage in different conduct,”whereas “the conduct at issue [inWolf] [wa]s exactly the same as that already protected: getting married.”Crabb said two major cases show “that the state cannot rely on a history of exclusion to narrow the scope of [a] right,”which “must be framed in neutral terms to prevent arbitrary exclusions of entire classes of people,”and history is not determinative, especially given more recent legal and societal changes.She concluded that Wisconsin laws interfere significantly with the right to marry, so they required support in “sufficiently important state interests . . . closely tailored to effectuate only these interests.”",
