## Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality

ABSTRACT. Proportionality, accepted as a general principle of  constitutional law by many countries,  requires that government intrusions  on freedoms  be justified,  that greater intrusions  have  stronger justifications,  and  that punishments  reflect  the  relative  severity  of the  offense.  Proportionality  as  a  doctrine  developed  by  courts,  as  in  Canada, has  provided  a  stable methodological  framework,  promoting structured,  transparent  decisions  even  about closely contested  constitutional  values.  Other benefits  of proportionality  include  its  potential  to  bring constitutional  law closer to constitutional justice,  to provide  a common  discourse about rights for all branches  of government,  and to help identify the kinds of failures  in democratic  process warranting heightened judicial  scrutiny. Earlier U.S.  debates  over  "balancing" were  not informed by recent comparative  experience with structured proportionality  doctrine and its benefits.

Many  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law  include  some  elements  of what  is  elsewhere  called proportionality  analysis.  I argue  here for greater  use  of  proportionality  principles  and doctrine;  I also  argue  that  proportionality  review  is  not  the  answer  to  all  constitutional  rights  questions. Free  speech  can benefit  from categorical  presumptions,  but in their application  and design proportionality  may be  relevant.  The  Fourth Amendment,  which  secures  a  "right"  against  "unreasonable  searches  and  seizures,"  is  replete with  categorical  rules  protecting  police  conduct from judicial  review; more  case-by-case  analysis  of the  "unreasonableness" or  disproportionality  of police conduct would better protect rights and the rule of  law.  "Disparate impact" equality  claims might be  better  addressed  through  more proportionate  review standards;  Eighth  Amendment review  of  prison sentences  would benefit from  more use  of  proportionality  principles.  Recognizing  proportionality's advantages,  and  limits,  would  better  enable  U.S.  constitutional  law to  at once protect rights and facilitate effective  democratic self-governance.

## INTRODUCTION

"Proportionality"  is  today accepted  as  a general  principle  of law  by  constitutional  courts and  international  tribunals  around  the world.' "Proportionality review,"  a  structured form of doctrine, now flows  across  national  lines,  a seemingly  common  methodology  for  evaluating  many  constitutional  and  human rights  claims. 2 The  United  States  is  often  viewed  as  an  outlier in  this  transnational  embrace  of proportionality  in  constitutional  law. 3 Yet some areas  of  U.S. constitutional law embrace proportionality as a principle, as in  Eighth Amendment  case  law, 4 or  contain  other  elements  of the  structured  "proportionality  review"  widely  used  in  foreign  constitutional  jurisprudence,'  including the  inquiry into  "narrow tailoring" or "less  restrictive  alternatives" found  in U.S. strict scrutiny. 6

Justice  Stephen Breyer has  suggested that there are  other areas  in which the appropriate  standard  of judicial  review  would  involve  examining  the  proportionality  of government  regulation.' For  example,  in United States v.  Alvarez, 8

1. In 2004, Canadian  scholar  David  Beatty asserted  that proportionality  review  was  the  "ultimate"  rule of law  for  resolving constitutional  questions  about rights;  as  a positive  matter, it was  the  dominant method  of constitutional  interpretation  in  the world,  and as a normative matter,  it  was  superior to  such  other methods  as  originalism or  textualism. DAVID M. BEATTY, THE ULTIMATE RULE  OF LAW 159-88 (2004). In 2005, U.S. legal  scholar David Law  identified  proportionality  as  a  "generic"  component  of constitutional  adjudication  around  the world.  David S.  Law, Generic Constitutional  Law, 89 MINN. L. REV. 652  (2005). On  the  role of  proportionality in  international  law and  administrative law, see, for  example,  HCJ 2056/04 Beit Sourik Vill.  Council v.  Gov't of  Israel,  58(5)  PD 807  [2004] (Isr.), translated  in 2004 ISR. L. REP. 264. See  also Grainne  de Birca, The Principle  of  Proportionality  and  its Application in  EC  Law, 13 Y.B. EUR. L. 105,  113  (1993).

2. The German  Constitutional  Court  has been particularly influential,  as  has  the  Canadian  Supreme Court,  in developing "proportionality  review"  in ways  that influence other countries. On how seemingly  similar approaches  may be applied or understood differently  in different countries,  see JACCO  BOMHOFF,  BALANCING CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS:  THE  ORIGINS  AND MEANINGS  OF POSTWAR  LEGAL DISCOURSE  (2013) (comparing U.S.  and German conceptions of balancing);  and Dieter Grimm, Proportionality  in Canadian  and German Constitutional  Jurisprudence, 57 U. TORONTO L.J.  383 (2007).

Justice Breyer's concurrence, joined by Justice Kagan,  associated  proportionality  review  with  intermediate  scrutiny  and  applied  this  standard  to  evaluate  a First Amendment challenge  to the Stolen Valor Act.' In his dissent in District  of Columbia v.  Heller,' Justice Breyer explicitly invoked the idea of proportionality  as  a  guide  to  permissible  regulation  under  the  Second  Amendment."  This explicit  invocation  of proportionality  led  some  scholars  to  begin  to  consider, critically,  the prospects  of  proportionality  review, as  it has  developed elsewhere in the world, being more fully embraced in the United States. 12

Given developments  within  and outside  the United  States,  the time  is  ripe to  take  a  fresh  look  at proportionality,  both  as  a  general  principle  in  constitutional  analysis  and as  a structured  doctrine of potential benefit  to discrete areas of U.S.  constitutional  law.  In 1987,  T. Alexander Aleinikoff criticized U.S.  constitutional  law for  its overreliance  on balancing  in doctrines  like  strict scrutiny and  in cases  like Tennessee v.  Garner1 3 or Mathews v. Eldridge,' where the Court aimed  to  strike  a  balance  among  different interests." Other  work  soon  followed, contrasting  more categorical  and rule-like  approaches,  on the one hand, and  standards,  on  the  other.i 6 The scholarship  of the late  198os  may have  in- further  back.

REV. 139, 157-66 (describing Justice Breyer's  concurrence in Bartnicki v.  Vopper-in which Justice Breyer  analyzed  whether the challenged "restrictions on speech ... are disproportionate"--  as demonstrating a  more  "flexible"  approach in  recognizing  "competing  constitutional  interests" between privacy  and free speech); cf Turner Broad.  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 227 (1997) (Breyer,  J.,  concurring  in  part) (arguing  that reviewing  court  should  consider  "whether there  are  significantly less  restrictive ways  to  achieve  Congress'  over-the-air programming objectives,  and ... whether the statute ... strikes a reasonable balance  between  potentially speech-restricting and speech-enhancing  consequences").

fluenced  case law in some areas towards  more categorical rules." 7 But these  earlier  U.S.  debates  could  not  have  been  informed  by  the  subsequent  course  of proportionality  review in other  countries.  Foreign  courts' experience with  proportionality  review  casts  new  light  on  these  enduring  questions  in ways  that suggest that  U.S. constitutional  law would benefit  from a moderate  increase  in the use of proportionality.

Proportionality  can be  understood as  a  legal principle,  as  a goal  of government,  and as  a  particular  structured approach  to judicial  review. As  a principle and as  a goal of constitutional  government, proportionality  is a "precept  of  justice,"' embodying  the idea  that larger  harms  imposed  by government  should be justified by more weighty  reasons  and that more severe transgressions  of the law  be  more  harshly  sanctioned  than  less  severe  ones. 9 Proportionality  as  a principle  is  embodied  in a  number  of current  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law: for example,  in Eighth Amendment  "cruel and unusual punishments"  and "excessive  fines"  case  law;  as  a  limit imposed  by  the Due  Process  Clause  on  the award of punitive damages;  and  in Takings  Clause cases  requiring "rough proportionality"  between  conditions  on  zoning  variances  and  the  benefits  of the variance  to  the property  owner.  In  each of these areas,  the principle  of proportionality  imposes  some  limit  on  otherwise  authorized  government  action,  a limit connected  to  a sense of fairness  to  individuals  or a desire to  prevent  government  abuse of power.  Proportionality  is centrally  concerned  with  how,  in a "democratic  society, . . . respect  for the dignity of all men is central," 2 '  reflected in  "our  Nation's  [longstanding]  belief in  the  'individuality  and  the  dignity  of the human being.""'

Proportionality  as  a  structured  legal doctrine  is used  by  some  (not  all) courts  that  treat proportionality  as  a  general  principle.  In  countries  like  Germany,  Canada,  and  Israel, courts  use  a  similar  multi-part  sequenced set  of

17. See  infra note  307. Compare, e.g., Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374 U.S.  398,  402-03, 406-07  (1963) (applying a compelling  interest standard  to review  claims for religious  accommodation  from generally  applicable  laws), with Emp't Div.  v.  Smith,  494  U.S. 872,  890  (1990) (rejecting claims for  "accommodation" of religious practices  as against  generally applicable laws).

questions;'  elsewhere,  such  questions  are  considered  but  in a  less  sequenced way.' In Canada,  for example,  structured  proportionality  review begins  with attention  to  the scope  of  what  a right is  intended to  protect;  if a right  has been infringed,  the  inquiry turns next to  the authority for  the  action, and  to the importance and  legitimacy of the government  purpose.  If an infringement  on interests  protected  by  a  right  is  shown,  and  if the  challenged  action  has  been "prescribed  by law"  sufficiently  precisely  and  for a  legitimate  and  sufficiently important  purpose,  then  the  constitutionality  of the means used  are  examined through  a  three-fold  inquiry  into: (a) rationality; (b)  minimal  impairment; and  (c)  proportionality as  such.' Several  of these  criteria  correspond with  elements in U.S.  "strict,"  "intermediate,"  or "rational basis"  scrutiny:  the  need for a  sufficiently  important  or  "compelling" government  purpose;  the  rational connection  required between  the means chosen  and the end;  and the "minimal impairment"  inquiry  into whether  there  are  less  restrictive  means  towards  the same  goal.

Structured  proportionality  analysis  in  countries  like  Canada,  Germany,  or Israel  includes  an  additional stage -"proportionality as  such" -asking whether the intrusion on the challenger's rights can  be justified by the  benefits  towards achieving  the important public  goal.  This step  calls for an  independent judicial evaluation  of whether  the  reasons  offered  by  the  government,  relative  to  the limitation  on  rights,  are  sufficient  to justify  the  intrusion.  While  this  step  is sometimes  referred  to  as  involving  "balancing,"  the  "proportionality  as  such" question  in  structured  proportionality  doctrine  differs  from  "balancing"  tests

that tend to focus  primarily on quantification  of net social good,  as in Dennis v. United States' or Mathews v. Eldridge.2 6

Take  Canada as  an example of structured,  sequenced proportionality analysis.  First,  "proportionality  as  such"  is  a part  of a doctrine  that,  as  a whole, prioritizes  the  right,  putting  the  burden  of justification  on  the  government. 2 7  In this respect, structured  proportionality analysis differs  from  "multi-factor" analyses  of proportionality,  as  one  sees  in some  countries,  including South Africa,2 or from  some U.S. "striking a balance"  case law.  Second,  Canadian-style proportionality  review  is  a logically  sequenced  set of inquiries  that  limits  the need to  consider whether  the  government  interests justify the  intrusion  on interests  protected  by  rights.  It  does  so  by  first  examining  whether  the  challenged action  is  authorized  by law,  and  then whether  the  government's purpose  is  sufficiently  important  to  serve  as  a basis  for limiting  the right  at  all.  If these first tests  are  met,  Canadian proportionality  review  examines  the  rationality  and  necessity  of the  means  chosen,  all  before  reaching  the final  "proportionality  as  such"  inquiry.  In  this  way,  if the  means  chosen  are  not suitable  or necessary  to advance  the  government's interest,  the case  can be  resolved  at one of these  stages:  the  courts  need  not  reach  the  "proportionality  as  such"  question  unless  there  is  a  genuine  conflict  between  the  government's  interest  and the interests  protected  by  the  right."  Third,  "proportionality  as such"  returns courts  to  considering  both  the  infringed-on  right  and  the  government's  purposes,  not just  in terms  of their theoretical  gravity,  but in terms  of the relative weight  or  bearing  of the  government's reasons in  relation  to  the  harm  to  the challenger's rights, in a particular context  and  in light of constitutional  values.

A  significant feature  of such a formulation  is  the apparent  absence  of any  prioritization  of the underlying  right  to  a  fair  hearing;  the Mathews test  suggests  a  kind  of quantifiable  cost-benefit inquiry,  without  giving  clear  weight  to  the  basic procedural  values  of fair  hearings  for  those  singled  out  for adverse  government treatment.

In this way,  courts are  not  "substituting"  their judgment for that of the legislature. 3 0 They are playing a valuable judicial role -checking to assure  appropriate attention  to rights within a framework  of  constitutional  justice.

Part  I  provides  background  for  considering  proportionality  in  the  United States.  It notes several  areas  of  U.S.  constitutional  law in which proportionality already  is an  element  of constitutional  analysis and argues  that one of the  goals of the Constitution was to produce  a just  government,  one likely to avoid arbitrariness  and to  act  proportionately.  As  further  background,  Part  I  goes  on  to describe  in more  detail the  structured form of proportionality review  as it exists in several  foreign countries,  with special  focus on Canada.

Part  II  explores why proportionality  has  not been  used  as  a general  principle  of constitutional  law  in the  United  States.  It  suggests that  the  aversive  impact  of Lochner v.  New  York 3 ' and Dennis v.  United States," as  "negative  precedents," 33 led to a search for categorical approaches to constrain judicial discretion.  Moreover,  the age  of the Constitution and  related interpretive  practices  help  account  for  the  absence  of any  general  embrace  of proportionality. For  example,  the  Constitution's brevity  and,  relatedly,  the  relative  dearth  of rights that are  viewed  as  in tension with  each other,  have tended  to  reinforce  a view  of rights  either  as  trumps3 or as prohibited  reasons  for  government  ac-

Compare, e.g., Jennifer  Nedelsky, Legislative Judgment and the Enlarged  Mentality,  in THE LEAST EXAMINED  BRANCH:  THE ROLE  OF LEGISLATURES  IN  THE CONSTITUTIONAL  STATE 95 (Richard W.  Bauman  &amp; Tsvi  Kahana  eds.,  2006)  (expecting  "intermittent conscious  reflection" by  legislators  to  constitutional values), with Ruth  Gavison, Legislatures and the Phases and Components of Constitutionalism,  in THE LEAST EXAMINED  BRANCH, supra, at 198, 198-99  (treating  constitutional interpretation  as primarily for courts,  not legislators).

This is  an idea associated  with Ronald Dworkin, see RONALD DWORKIN, TAKING RIGHTS SERIOUSLY xi,  90-100,  190-97 (1977),  though  perhaps  contestably so, see Stephen Gardbaum, A Democratic Defense  of Constitutional Balancing, 4 LAw  &amp; ETHICS  HUM.  RTs.  78,  85 n.29 (2010); see  also ROBERT  NOZICK,  ANARCHY,  STATE,  AND  UTOPIA  26-53 (1974) (discussing rights as  "side constraints").

tion. 35 These  conceptions  contrast with  alternative  understandings  of rights  as presumptive  protections  of human  interests36  or  as  values  to  be  optimized, 37 which  some leading theorists  link with proportionality  review.  And,  unlike European  countries,  which  have  incentives  to  harmonize  national  constitutional law  with  international  rights  regimes  that rely  on  proportionality,  the  United States has  not been comfortable  treating  its international  human  rights obligations as judicially enforceable  domestically.38

Part  III  makes  an  affirmative  case  for  greater  use  of proportionality  as  a principle  and  for  structured proportionality  as  a  standard  of  review  in  the United  States.  I  begin  by  looking  at  discrete  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law, starting  with Fourth Amendment  cases like Atwater v. City of  Lago Vista, 39 with rigid  rules allowing  police  to detain  and  search regardless  of the  severity  of the offense -rules that facilitate  humiliating  and badly  intentioned police conduct. Excluding  proportionality  considerations  neither  fulfills  the  purpose  of  the Fourth Amendment nor promotes  respect for the Constitution  as  law.  Canadian case law  on analogous  rights  offers  an  alternative  approach.  I  then  consider a recent  First Amendment  case, Holder v.  Humanitarian  Law Project, 4 0 that appears  to  depart  from  existing  categorical  rules.  Applying  structured  proportionality  analysis  in  this case,  I  suggest,  would  require  more  disciplined  attention both to  free speech  and national security interests,  in order to clarify which considerations  control.

Next,  I  discuss  some  general  normative  arguments  in  favor  of structured proportionality review  and  proportionality principles. First,  Canadian-style proportionality  review  promotes  structured  and transparent  decisions  through

CHI.  L. REv.  413,  414 (1996) (arguing  that the  purpose of the  presumption  against  content-based  regulation is the likelihood of  illicit government  purpose for such regulation).

a  stable  methodological framework. Second,  proportionality as  a  principle helps  bring  constitutional  law  closer  to  constitutional  justice.  Third,  proportionality  principles and  structured  proportionality review provide a  better bridge between  courts  and other branches  of government,  offering criteria for constitutional  behavior that are usable  by,  and open  to  input from,  legislatures and executives.  Fourth,  proportionality  analysis  can reveal  process  failures,  including departures  from impartial  governance,  warranting  heightened judicial scrutiny.

Part IV takes up several  objections to  proportionality  review -that it is  irrational,  insufficiently  protective  of rights,  unduly  intrusive  on  legislatures,  or overempowering  of courts -and responds  to  each.  I  give  special  attention  to the  concern  that  proportionality  review  might  focus  too  much  attention  on governmental justifications  for its  means and  not enough  on deontological  understandings  of rights.  I  suggest  that  more  deontological  understandings of rights,  and attention  to  particular  constitutional  texts  and lines  of cases,  is  appropriate  both in initially defining whether  a right has  been infringed and what ends  are  legitimate,  and  also  in  evaluating  "proportionality  as  such."  Part  IV also  considers  arguments  from American  exceptionalism  that would  preclude greater  use  of proportionality  review.  Exceptionalist  claims,  however,  cannot be  made or answered  in broad brushstrokes;  indeed,  I  argue, U.S.  history and experience  support greater use  of  proportionality.

Although  some  scholars  view  case-by-case application  of proportionality analysis  as  almost  always  normatively  superior  to  other  approaches  to  rights adjudication, 4 1 Part V takes  a  different  view. Text,  history,  and  precedent  matter.  Not  all  rights  have  the  same  structure  nor  serve  the  same  purposes;  free speech  claims,  which  benefit  from  a  presumptively  categorical  structure,  are different from police behavior or criminal  sentences,  both of which would benefit  from  greater  attention  to  proportionality. Even  in  adjudicating  a  single claim,  different issues may call for different  treatment.  In equal protection law, paying more attention to disproportionate effects  need not imply embrace of all elements  of structured proportionality doctrine.  Moreover,  sometimes  the most "proportionate"  results  will  be  achieved  through  categorical  rules,  especially when  remedial  frameworks  are  considered."' At  least  some  of these  rule-like regimes  can  be justified in terms  of proportionality  analysis  at the  level  of the rule.  Being proportional  about  proportionality  means  recognizing  that history

See BEArY, supra note 1; cf MOLLER, supra note 29, at  24, 75-90, 180  (describing  the  purpose of constitutional  rights  as  ensuring  that  autonomy interests  are  protected  through justifications  under proportionality and balancing  tests,  though  noting  limited  areas  not  subject to proportionality  review  or to all its sub-tests).

and text have roles  to  play,  and that proportionality  as a principle is not always served by proportionality as  a doctrine.

## I. PROPORTIONALITY  IN  U.S.  CONSTITUTIONALISM  AND  ABROAD

Proportionality  as  an element  of constitutional  doctrine  has  already  been recognized  in  several  areas  of contemporary  constitutional  law  in the  United States.  This  is  not surprising,  since  well-designed  constitutions  are  generally intended to promote proportionate,  non-arbitrary  government  behavior.  What the United States  does  not presently use  is the structured  "proportionality  doctrine"  described  in Part I.C.

## A. Proportionality Principles  Already Recognized in U.S. Constitutional  Law

Americans  are already familiar with the legal  principle  of proportionality  in constitutional  law.  The Eighth Amendment's case law has long recognized  that punishments  grossly disproportionate to the severity  of the offense are prohibited as  cruel  and  unusual punishment, 43 although  the Court's willingness  actually to scrutinize  the proportionality  of sentences has  varied over time and  contexts.a The  Excessive  Fines  Clause  of the  Eighth  Amendment  has  also  been

43. See,  e.g., Graham v.  Florida, 560 U.S. 48,  59 (2010) ("The  concept of proportionality is  central  to  the  Eighth Amendment.");  Solem v.  Helm,  463 U.S. 277  (1983) (assessing  the proportionality  of a  sentence  of life  imprisonment);  Enmund  v.  Florida,  458  U.S.  782 (1982) (assessing  the  proportionality  of a  death  penalty  sentence);  Weems  v.  United  States, 217 U.S.  349,  367 (1910) (arguing  that  the  Eighth Amendment  ban  on cruel and  unusual punishment  embodies  the  "precept  of justice  that punishment  for  crime  should  be  graduated and proportioned  to offense").  Although the  Justices making up the majority  in Harmelin  v. Michigan, 501 U.S.  957 (1991), were  divided  on  whether  proportionality  review  applies  in non-capital  cases, Weems had applied  such review to  a  punishment of hard labor for  a term of years.  In  so  doing, Weems was  consistent  with  earlier  Supreme  Court comments  on  the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. See Pervear v. Massachusetts, 72 U.S.  (5  Wall.) 475,  480 (1867) (suggesting that Eighth Amendment clauses  as  a whole prohibited  punishments  that were  "excessive,  or  cruel,  or  unusual"); cf O'Neil v.  Vermont, 144 U.S. 323,  331  (1892) (quoting  a  lower  court  opinion construing  the  Eighth Amendment  and  an  analogous state constitutional  provision  to ban  "excessive,"  "oppressive,"  or  "unreasonably  severe"  punishments, but for other  reasons  rejecting an  attack  on a lengthy sentence  imposing cumulative time on multiple  counts); see also infra notes 425-426.
44. For example, from  1983, when Solem, 463  U.S. 277, was decided,  until Graham, 560 U.S. 48 (2010), the  Court did  not  invalidate  any  sentence  of imprisonment  for  disproportionality under  the  Eighth Amendment.  But since 1977, the  Court  has  invalidated  capital  sentences for  rape  of an adult,  Coker  v.  Georgia,  433  U.S.  584 (1977); for felony  murder  by one who did not personally  kill or intend or attempt to kill, Enmund, 458 U.S. 782; for rape  of a child, Kennedy v.  Louisiana, 554  U.S. 407 (2008); and for persons with mental  retardation, Atkins v.  Virginia,  536  U.S. 304 (2002), or who were juveniles  at the time of the  conviction offense, Roper  v.  Simmons,  543  U.S. 551  (2005). In Graham the Court  held  unconstitutional  a  life

understood  to  impose proportionality  limits. 45 Since  the  1990s  the  Court  has invoked  proportionality  in  several  other constitutional  contexts.  For  example, under the Due Process  Clause,  courts must now ensure that the measure of punitive damages  in civil  cases  "is  both reasonable  and proportionate to the  amount of harm  to  the plaintiff and  to  the  general  damages  recovered."4 6 Under  the Takings  Clause,  conditions  for zoning permits  must have "rough proportionality"  to  the  effects  of the proposed  use  of the  property. 47 Furthermore,  the "undue  burden"  standard  is  now  the  controlling  inquiry  in  the  Court's abortion cases,  invoking in its  language and application  a concern for the reasonableness of regulations  affecting  women's choices  to  abort their pregnancies prior  to viability.8  All  of these  standards  invoke  proportionality  in  resolving  individual rights  questions, as do Justice  Breyer's First Amendment opinions. 49  Moreover, the  Court  has  extended  proportionality  standards  to  federalism  issues:  as  of 1997,  legislation  under  Section  5  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  must  have "congruence  and proportionality"  to  conduct that Section  1  prohibits. 5 0

As  these  examples  suggest,  U.S.  courts  have  found  the  concept  of proportionality  increasingly  attractive  in resolving  interpretive  challenges,  prompting scholars to  identify the roots of proportionality doctrines  in U.S. constitutional law.  Richard  Fallon,  for  example,  has  drawn  comparisons  between  European proportionality  doctrine  and  U.S.  strict  scrutiny  as  it  emerged  in  the  196os (and  applied  thereafter),"  while  Alec  Stone  Sweet  and  Jud Mathews  see  proportionality  review  in  nineteenth  century  Dormant Commerce  Clause  cases." Attraction to proportionality in both the courts  and  the academy is no surprise, without parole sentence  for a juvenile convicted  of a non-homicide  offense;  in Miller v. Alabama, 132 S.  Ct. 2455  (2012), the Court  held  unconstitutional  mandatory  life  without parole sentences  for juveniles  convicted of homicide,  concluding  that imposition  of such a sentence required  individualized consideration.

since an aspiration to proportionate  government,  as an important  aspect of  justice,  is implicit in the constitutional  design.

## B.  Proportionate  Government  as a Goal  of Constitutional  Design

The Constitution's Preamble states  that one  of  its  goals  is to  "establish Justice,"  echoing  the  defining  commitments  of  leading  state  constitutional  instruments  of the time. 53 "Justice" has,  at  least  since  the time  of  Aristotle,  been associated  with proportionality. 54 Although  the Preamble  does not contain  independently  operative  grants of  power, it  nonetheless  provides  important background for understanding  constitutional purposes  relevant to the interpretation of the  operative  provisions  that  follow."  Similarly,  there are  allusions  to proportionality  in  the  Federalist Papers,  where  the  constitutional  design  is  described  more generally  as  aimed to  produce "a wise and well-balanced  govern-

These sorts of commitments  to government  that is just, and  to proportionality  in the government's treatment  of citizens,  have  deep  roots  in antecedents to the U.S.  Constitution,  including  the Magna  Carta.  The  Magna Carta's articles  on  "Amercements"  plainly expressed  a  demand for  proportionality  in the imposition  of fines; 59 other  provisions  of the  Magna Carta  called  for  "justice" to  be  provided  through  the  law  courts.6' As  Dick  Howard  has  shown,  the Magna  Carta's  influence  was  felt  in  the  American  colonists'  demands  for recognition  of their rights  as  English citizens  in  accordance  with  colonial charters;6"  the  influence  of the  Magna  Carta and  the English Bill of Rights 6 z  is  further  reflected  in  founding  period  state  constitutions,  in  requirements  that  no

62. The English Bill of Rights of 1689  is an important source  for the text of the Eighth Amendment. See An Act Declaring  the  Rights and Liberties  of the  Subject,  and Settling  the Succession of the  Crown  (Bill  of Rights),  1689,  1  W. &amp; M., c.2, §  10 (Eng.)  ("That excessive  bail ought  not to be required,  nor excessive  fines  imposed,  nor cruel and  unusual punishments inflicted... .").

"cruel  and unusual" punishments  nor "excessive  fines" be imposed, 6 3  as well  as in the right to open courts. 6 '  Both  Massachusetts's  and  Virginia's  postrevolutionary  constitutions  emphasized  "justice"  and  "moderation"  as  among the  first  virtues of the  governments  they  sought  to  establish. 6 , Similar  requirements  are  evident in most modern  constitutions  in  constitutional  democracies,  and even when not explicit, the goal  of  proportionality  is  implicit in any constitution  that  aims  to  produce  justice  by  limiting  as  well  as  empowering government. 6 6

Proportionality  bears  a  special  relationship  to  government  in  a  constitutional  democracy.  For  an  essential  idea  of constitutional  democracy  is  that  in confrontations  between citizens and government,  government is restrained and avoids  oppressive  and  arbitrary  action. 6 7  The  means  to  achieve  this  goal  are varied,  but requiring  proportionality  of action  is  one  way in which  the  idea of

At least nine of the thirteen original  states' constitutions included  some such  prohibition. See DEL.  DECLARATION  OF  RIGHTS  § 16  (1776); MASS.  DECLARATION  OF RIGHTS art.  XXVI (1780) (forbidding  any  magistrate  or  court  to  "inflict  cruel  or  unusual punishments"); MAss.  BODY  OF LIBERTIES § 46 (1641);  MD.  DECLARATION  OF RIGHTS  art. XXII (1776); N.H.

DECLARATION OF RIGHTS  § 9 (1776)  (banning "excessive  fines"  and "cruel and unusal punishments"). For  a discussion  of proportionality  of punishment  requirements  in early  state  constitutions, see Thomas A.  Balmer, Some  Thoughts on Proportionality, 87 OR.  L. REV.  783, 793-95 (2008). As  Balmer  notes,  some  early  constitutions  prohibiting  disproportionate  punishment  were revised  to prohibit  "cruel and unusual"  punishments;  at least one state court concluded  that the change in wording was not intended to abandon  a proportionality requirement.

limited governnment  can be realized. 68 Second,  constitutional  democracies'  legitimacy  is  based on  accountability  to the people,  including but not limited  to majoritarian  consent.  Elections  provide  one  source of accountability,  but ensuring that government  has justified reasons  for action (whether legislative or executive)  helps  promote  accountability  on  an onging basis. 6 ' Third,  constitutional  democracies are  not  only  limited  governments; they  are  goverments limited by  a  commitment  to  fundamental  human  equality.  It  is  on  that commitment to  the normative equality of all  members of the polity that democratic self-governance  rests.'" Recognizing  each person  as  endowed with a  quality of humanity equally  deserving  of respect arguably  calls  for reasoned  justification for the imposition of special  burdens or intrusions."

Recognizing proportionality  as  a  goal  of  constitutional  government  does not necessarily  imply  that judicial review  is  the  best method for achieving  proportionate  decision  making.  For  example, McCulloch  v.  Maryland concluded that the principal protection against abusive  taxation is  the link between  representation and the taxed constituency. 2 Legislators  and executive  actors may  be understood  ordinarily to  have  obligations  to act proportionately, even  if those obligations  are not justiciable. What, then,  is  the  role  of judges  in implement-

ing the  constitutional  value  of proportionality?  I  consider  this  question  first outside the United States  and then within it.

## C.  Proportionality Elsewhere: The  United States in Comparative  Perspective

Having  suggested  that  the  principle  of proportionality  is  part  of the  U.S. Constitution,  I  turn now  to proportionality  as  a structured  doctrine  developed in the post-World War II  period in Germany,  Canada,  Israel,  and elsewhere. 3 Although  there  are  differences  in  doctrinal  terms and  applications  among  different courts, 74 for purposes of comparison to U.S.  approaches,  I focus primarily on Canada,7 5 drawing  from other jurisdictions  to  illustrate  particular points.

73. The  origin  of "proportionality  doctrine"  is  often  attributed  to  German  administrative  and police  law of the  nineteenth  century. See,  e.g., COHEN-ELIYA  &amp; PORAT, PROPORTIONALITY, supra note 3,  at 24-32. Whether  German law inspired Canadian law in this instance  is uncertain. See ROBERT J. SHARPE &amp; KENT ROACH, BRIAN  DICKSON: A JUDGE'S JOURNEY 334 (2003) (suggesting  that the Oakes test may  have come  from case law  of the European Court of Human Rights);  Grimm, supra note 2, at  383-84  (raising  the possibility  that  the Oakes test was derived  from Central Hudson  Gas &amp; Electric Co.  v.  Public Service Commission, 447  U.S. 557 (1980), but alternatively  suggesting  that it could  have come  from Germany);  Margit Cohn, Legal Transplant  Chronicles: The Evolution  of Unreasonableness  and Proportionality Review of the Administration in the United Kingdom, 58 Am. J.  COMP.  L. 583, 620  n.134  (2010)  (noting the strong  similarities  between  the  German  and  Canadian  tests  and  the possibility  that Oakes may  have  been inspired  by  German constitutional  law, through Justice Dickson's law clerk, Joel Bakan, who had recently studied European  human rights law).

74. See  infra note 84; supra notes 23,  28.
75. Canada is an especially apt point of comparison.  Canada has  long had judicial review of constitutional  constraints on  government.  Its 1867 Constitution Act allocated powers to the central  and  provincial  governments,  and  conferred  a limited  number  of rights  to  protect  minority  religions and  languages. See Constitution  Act,  1867, 30 &amp; 31 Vict.,  c.3,  §§ 91-93,  133 (U.K.), reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, app.  III,  no.  5  (Can.).  The  Supreme  Court  of Canada  was established  in  1875,  and,  acknowledging the  influence of U.S.  cases,  began resolving  constitutional controversies  soon thereafter.  Canada's early constitutional  cases  focused primarily on the division of powers between the provincial and federal  governments. See,  e.g., Citizens &amp; Queen Ins.  Co v.  Parsons, [1880] 4.  S.C.R. 215,  277-82 (Fournier,  J.),  287-88  (Henry,  J.), 298-301,  304-06  (Taschereau,  J.) (discussing  McCulloch v.  Maryland, 17 U.S.  (4 Wheat.) 316, and Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S.  (8  Wall.)  168  (1869));  Severn  v.  The Queen,  [1878] 2 S.C.R. 70,  120-29 (Fournier, J.)  (discussing Brown v.  Maryland, 25 U.S. 419  (1827)). Moreover,  even before  the  adoption  of its  statutory  Bill  of Rights  in 1960, or  its constitutional  Charter  of Rights  and Freedoms  in 1982, the  Canadian  Court  limited  government  through  statutory interpretation  in light  of  unwritten constitutional  principles. See,  e.g., John Willis, Administrative Law and the British North America Act, 53  HARv.  L.  REv. 251, 275  (1939) (noting  the "spurious  interpretation"  of  statutes  to  protect due  process  rights, despite  the lack  of a constitutional  basis); see also Roncarelli v.  Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121,  142 (Rand, J.)  (finding that a duty of good  faith, implicit  in the  rule  of law,  binds  public officials).  And,  like in  the United  States  (and unlike in  Germany),  in Canada, judicial  review of constitutional  issues  is "decentralized"- that is,  it  is  not  limited  to a single  specialized  constitutional  court,  so  that many courts  in the country can  address constitutional  claims.

In 1982, after a long public  process,  Canada  adopted as  part of its constitution the  Charter  of Rights  and  Freedoms,  which  in  Section  One  guaranteed  the rights  set  forth  therein  "subject  only  to  such  reasonable  limits  prescribed  by law  as  can be  demonstrably justified  in a free  and  democratic  society."7 6 This provision  may be  referred  to as a  "limitations"  clause because  it recognizes  that rights  may  be  limited  by  strong  enough  reasons,  or as  a "savings"  clause,  because  statutes  otherwise  infringing  on  rights may  be  preserved  from  invalidation  by  meeting  the  standards  of Section  One.  Canadian  doctrine  has  developed  a  proportionality  test to determine  whether this standard is  met." Limitations  clauses  in  other  countries have  also  been  understood to  invite courts  to  review  the justifications  for government action through proportionality analysis.7 8

In  Canada,  when  government  action  is  challenged  as  violating  a  Charter right,  the  challenger  bears  the burden  of showing  a rights  infringement,  and Canadian judges  first inquire  into  the scope  of the  interests that the right protects.  In  so  doing,  the  court  typically  adopts  a  generous  view  of the  scope  of what  is  protected  by  the  right. 79 The  court  then  considers  whether  the  gov-

77. See supra note 24 and accompanying text.  Similar tests are used in Germany,  Israel,  and other jurisdictions;  the  similarity  of  these approaches  is a testament  to the  global spread of proportionality  analyses  in constitutional  law. See  supra note  73. See generally Stone  Sweet  &amp; Mathews, supra note  37.  On why surface  similarities may contain  important differences,  see BOMHOFF, supra note 2 (comparing  "balancing"  analyses  in  the United  States  and Germany).

("There  shall  be  no  violation  of rights  under this Basic  Law  except  by a  law  befitting  the values  of  the  State  of Israel, enacted  for  a proper purpose,  and to an extent  no greater than is required.");  S. AFR.  CONST.,  1996, 5 36(1)  ("The  rights in the Bill of Rights  may be  limited only in  terms of law of general  application  to the extent  that the limitation is reasonable  and justifiable  in an open and democratic  society  based on human dignity, equality and freedom, taking  into account  all  relevant factors  .... ").  Rights  may also  have  "internal"  limitations embracing  principles  of proportionality,  as  in  Canada's "qualified  rights." See 2 PETER W. HOGG, CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW OF CANADA ch. 38-14 ( 5 th ed. supp. 2007). Such rights  include the  protections  against  "unreasonable"  search  or  seizure,  "arbitrary"  detention,  and  "cruel and unusual  treatment  or  punishment,"  each  of which  is  discussed  below. See  infra notes 189-201,  430-431.
79. See Vicki C. Jackson, Ambivalent Resistance and Comparative  Constitutionalism:  Opening  up the Conversation  on  "Proportionality," Rights and  Federalism, s U. PA. J. CONST. L. 583,  606  (1999) (noting the tendency  in Canada to interpret the  scope of the right broadly and to decide  cases under the justificatory  stage  of  analysis); see also Peter W.  Hogg, Interpreting  the Charter  of Rights:  Generosity and Justification, 28  OSGOODE  HALL L.J. 817, 819-20 (1990) (identifying and critiquing  this approach).  This  difference  between  the  U.S.  and  Canadian  approaches can  be illustrated  by comparing free  speech cases: the Canadian  courts interpret  "freedom of expression"  to include  any activity,  except for physical violence,  that "conveys  or attempts to

Compare, e.g., Reference  re  §§ 193  &amp;  195.1(1)(c) of Criminal Code  (the Prostitution Reference  Case), [1990]  1 S.C.R.  1123,  1125  (Can.)  (holding  that solicitation  of prostitution is within the scope of freedom  of  expression  protected  under Charter §  2(b),  but that the  legislative  infringement on  speech  rights was  justified under § 1), with United  States  v.  Stevens, 559 U.S.  460, 469-70  (2010) (discussing  "historically unprotected  categories"  of  speech), and Pittsburgh Press  Co.  v.  Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human  Relations,  413 U.S.  376, 388  (1973) ("We  have no doubt that a newspaper constitutionally could  be  forbidden to  publish a want  ad proposing  a  sale  of  narcotics  or  soliciting  prostitutes.").  More  recently,  the  Canadian  Supreme Court found that certain restrictions on  prostitution were violations  of Charter § 7's protection of "security of the person" that were not saved  by  §  1,  because  insofar  as they prevented prostitutes from  screening prospective  clients  to  protect their own  safety,  prohibiting communication with respect  to prostitution was "grossly disproportionate" to  the valid objective of the law. Canada v.  Bedford,  2013  SCC  72,  [2013]  3  S.C.R. 1101,  11  22-23,  69-72,  108-09, 120-22,  133-34,  159,  161-63  (Can.).

- So. A  rights  limitation  can  only  be justified  if it is  "prescribed by  law."  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms § 1,  Part I of the Constitution Act,  1982, being Schedule  B  to  the Canada Act,  1982,  c.  11  (U.K.). See Greater Vancouver  Trans. Auth.  v.  Can. Fed'n of  Students, 2009  SCC 31,  [2009]  2 S.C.R.  295, ¶¶ 70-73  (Can.)  (holding that a policy  restricting advertising on the side  of public  buses  was  "prescribed by law" since  it was  binding,  properly enacted, precise,  and publicly accessible); Little Sisters  Book &amp; Art Emporium v.  Canada, 2000 SCC 69,  [2000]  2 S.C.R.  1120, ¶ 85, 141  (Can.)  (finding  that customs  officials'  discriminatory treatment of gay  and lesbian  materials could  not  be justified  since  the discrimination arose from  internal administrative decisions  and was  not  "prescribed  by  law").  Rights  limitations under the  authority of an excessively  vague  law will  not constitute a limit  "prescribed by law":  "where there is  no  intelligible  standard  and where  the legislature  has given  a plenary discretion  to do whatever seems  best  in a wide  set of circumstances,  there is  no 'limit prescribed by law.'" Irwin Toy, [1989]  1  S.C.R.  at 983.
81. R. v.  Oakes, [1986]  1 S.C.R. 103, 138-39  (Can.)  (explaining  that to  justify  rights  infringements under §  i, the law's  objective  must be  "pressing and substantial," or "of  sufficient  importance  to  warrant overriding  a constitutionally  protected  right or freedom").  In  practice, the Court has  rejected the sufficiency  of government objectives  only where the  objective  was found  to  be  either  illegitimate  or  nonexistent. See  infra note  82.  The  distinctive  Canadian formulation is  often  compared to  the German test, which  requires simply  a "legitimate purpose." See, e.g., David  Bilchitz, Socio-Economic  Rights,  Economic Crisis,  and Legal  Doctrine,  14 INT'L J. CONST. L. 710, 735  (2014).
82. See,  e.g., Vriend v.  Alberta,  [1998]  1  S.C.R.  493, ¶i 113-15  (Can.)  (invalidating  the omission of sexual  orientation as a protected ground in a  human rights code,  finding  the government had no  articulated objective  served  by the omission);  R.  v.  Big  M  Drug Mart Ltd.,  [1985]  1 S.C.R.  295  (Can.) (invalidating  a statute requiring most  stores  to  close  on  Sunday because its purpose -to try to  force  religious  observance-was  illegitimate). For a  lower  court decision,  later  overruled,  that  a statute  lacked  the  "pressing and substantial purpose" required under the Oakes test, see Canada (A.G.)  v.  Somerville, [1996]  184 A.R.  241 (Can.  Alb.  C.A.), which  found  that provisions  in  the  Canada Elections  Act  imposing  advertising  blackouts and  limiting  third party election  expenditures  had  an  improper purpose  of enhancing  the

ment action  authorized  by law  and  has  a  "pressing  and  substantial"  purpose, the  Court  then  considers  whether  the  government  has  shown  that  the  challenged action  is "demonstrably  justified." 5 8

At  this justificatory  stage,  the  courts  employ a  three-part inquiry,  focusing on  the means used  to  advance  the government's  purpose and  asking  whether (1) the  means  chosen  are  rationally  related  to  the  legitimate  object; (2) the means  chosen  "minimally  impair"  protected  rights;  and (3) the  benefits towards  achieving  the  government's objective  are sufficient  to warrant  the  harm to  interests  protected  by rights  (a step  called "proportionality  as such").4  The rationality  step  is  similar  to U.S.  rational  basis  review. 5 Although  this element position  of  political  parties  and their candidates  and hence violated the Charter.  The Alberta court's reasoning on this point was, however,  rejected in  Libman v.  Quebec  (A.G.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 569,  ¶¶ 55-56, 79.

83. Canadian jurists  emphasize the connection between  the protection  of rights and the kinds of justifications  that  can  support  their  limitation. See,  e.g.,  Oakes, [1986]  1 S.C.R.  at  135; cf Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Individual  Rights and the Powers  of  Government, 27 GA.  L. REV.  343,  344 (1993) (arguing  that rights  and consequentialist concerns  justifying limiting rights  are  conceptually  interdependent).
84. See, e.g.,  Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R.  at 139 (deciding that there  are "three  important components of a proportionality test"):

First, the  measures adopted  must be carefully designed to  achieve  the  objective in question.  They must not be arbitrary,  unfair or based  on irrational  considerations. ... Second,  the  means ... should  impair  "as  little  as possible"  the right or freedom in question.  Third,  there must be  a proportionality  between  the effects of the measure . . . and  the  objective  which  has  been  identified  as  of  "sufficient  importance."

If the statute is  found  (as  most  are)  to be  a  "rational"  means  of advancing the government's purpose,  the courts  go  on to  consider whether it impairs the right "as little  as  reasonably  possible in  order to  achieve  the  legislative objective.""' This minimal  impairment step  has  sometimes  been  described  as  a cognate test to the U.S.  "least restrictive alternative" requirement in strict scrutiny; this  second  step  is  sometimes  described  in scholarly  literature as  a  "necessity" test. 88 However,  the minimal impairment test does not necessarily  imply that if any less  restrictive  approach can be  imagined,  the law  is  invalid;"  the government "is  not required to  pursue the least  drastic means  of achieving  its  objective,"  so  long  as  it  "adopt[s]  a  measure that falls  within a  range  of reasonable alternatives." 9 The  Canadian courts will  look  to see  whether  there is  an obvious and workable  alternative,  sometimes  drawing on approaches  already in use by governments,  as  in a  recent  case  involving  procedures  for secret  evidence  in immigration proceedings." 1 Chief Justice  McLachlin  has  emphasized  that  the analysis],  the appraisal of government motives  and choice  of means  is more searching").

(citations  omitted),  Chief Justice McLachlin,  writing  for only  herself,  stated that in applying  the minimal  impairment step the  courts recognize  the  government's  "margin of appreciation in  selecting  the means  to achieve  its objective" and  focus on  whether  the  challenged measures  "fall  within  a  range  of  reasonable alternatives," especially  "where the  impugned measures  'attempt  to  strike a balance  between the  claims  of  legitimate  but competing  social values.'"

"important  point"  is whether  proposed  alternative  (and less  rights-impairing) means  would be "less  effective"  in advancing  the government's goal. 92

In cases  involving  more  polycentric  interests,  "minimal  impairment"  scrutiny  can  allow  considerable  latitude  to  legislative  choices.  In Edwards Books, 93 the Canadian Supreme Court upheld an Ontario  statute establishing  Sunday as a common day of recreation in which  most retail  businesses  had to close.  The statute  had  an exception  for  employers  who  closed  for  Sabbath  on  Saturday and had fewer  than seven employees working on Sunday, 94 but several  Ontario retailers,  including some  owned  by  observant  Jews,  challenged the  statute. They argued that the different approach  taken  in New Brunswick  was less  impairing of religious freedom  rights; New Brunswick provided an exemption for any retailer with  a  sincere  religious  belief that it needed  to close  on a  day  other than Sunday. 95 The Court was not persuaded  that  New Brunswick's  approach the  "least  intrusive"  and stating  that  in light  of different  options  and  objectives  "the  government  may legitimately  employ  a more  restrictive  measure . . . if that  measure . . . further[s]  the  objective  in  ways  that  alternative  responses  could not,"  provided it is  otherwise proportionate  to a  valid objective).  Canadian  scholars  are  divided on whether  relaxation  of the minimal impairment rest "is  a good or a bad thing." Jackson, supra note 79, at  608.

92. Quebec (Att'y Gen.) v.  A., [2013]  1 S.C.R.  ¶ 442; see supra note  87. Quebec (Attorney General) v.  A. involved a  Charter challenge to  Quebec's failure to treat de facto  marriages  as  carrying the full  range  of  property  rights  and  support  on termination  as  did formalized  marriages  or civil unions.  Four justices  found no violation  of Charter equality rights;  five justices  found a violation  of Section  15  equality  rights.  However,  Chief Justice  McLachlin  (one  of the  five) concluded  that the statute  could  nonetheless  be salvaged under  Section 1. For Chief Justice McLachlin,  the goal  of  the  Quebec scheme was  "choice  and autonomy  for all Quebec  spouses  ... to  structure their  relationship  outside  ... the mandatory regime applicable  to married and civil  union spouses," [2013] 1 S.C.R.  '  435 (McLachlin,  C.J.),  supported by considerations  of federalism, id. 1q  439-49; see  id.  ¶ 447  (describing  Quebec  as  seeking  to  "maximiz[e]"  autonomy and choice).  Three other justices who found a Section  15  violation would have  upheld all  but the  support  provisions  under Section 1. Justice Abella,  who alone  found none of the  equality violations  to  be justified  under Section 1, disagreed with the Chief Justice  as  to  minimal  impairment  and  proportionality  as  such, see id. ¶5 358-80 (Abella,  J., dissenting) (arguing  that  an  "opt  out"  approach, with  presumptive  application  of the  same rules  to  de  facto  as  to  formal  marriage,  was  less  impairing  because  it  would  better  protect the  economically  vulnerable  partner  and would  equally  advance  the purpose).  Their  disagreement  may illustrate  the significance  of  how the government's purpose  is articulated.  For Justice Abella,  the  goal was  simply "freedom  of choice," id. 9 358, a  goal that  could be served as  well,  with less  harm to  the  economically  weaker partner, by  the  opt-out approach, id. ¶ 377-79. On the  risks of accepting  "maximization"  as part of  a government  goal, see  Alberta v. Hutterian  Brethren of  Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009]  2 S.C.R. 567, 5q 147,  149 (Abella, J.,  dissenting);  and id. 5  195  (LeBel,  J.,  dissenting).  These  disagreements  might  be  understood as  about defining the  government purpose,  or as  about what a "reasonable  alternative" is  for  minimal impairment  purposes.

was less  impairing: New  Brunswick made the exemption  available regardless of the number of employees, but Ontario did not require the employer  to claim  a sincere  religious  belief.  So  a small  shopkeeper employing  observant Jews  could benefit from the exemption  regardless of the employer's beliefs. 6 Likewise,  the Court found,  another proposed  alternative-allowing  an  exemption  to  be  invoked  by individual  employees-was not necessarily  more  minimally  impairing, because  of subtle social  pressures  on employees  not to  assert such  claims. 97 Given  the complexity of  the  rights-holders'  interests -as  owners,  employees, and consumers -the Court could  not conclude  that one  approach was  less  impairing of  rights  than  another;  the  infringement  on  religious  freedoms  was found  not disproportionate to  the legislature's objective;  and so  Ontario's law stood.98

The last stage  of analysis  is sometimes  called "proportionality as such." 99 In this phase,  the court asks whether  the government's reasons  for regulating and the degree  to which  they are likely to be served can justify  the harm to  constitutionally  protected  interests.  By  going  beyond  rationality and minimal  impairment,  the  "proportionality  as  such" test  can  make  the  doctrine  more  rigorous than U.S.  strict scrutiny,  which  ends  after the  "least restrictive means"  test.  In Oakes, Chief Justice Dickson  explained  that:

Some  limits  on  [Charter] rights and freedoms . . . will  be more  serious than others  in terms of the nature of the right or freedom  violated,  the extent  of  the  violation,  and  the  degree  to  which  the  measures  which impose  the limit trench upon the integral principles of a free  and democratic society. Even  if an objective  is  of sufficient  importance,  and  the first two  elements  of the  proportionality test are satisfied,  it is  still possible  that, because  of the severity of the deleterious  effects  of a measure on  individuals or  groups,  the measure will  not be justified  by the purposes  it  is  intended  to  serve. The  more  severe the  deleterious effects  of a

98. Id. at 779.  The  Court added:  "[T]he  courts must be  cautious  to ensure  that  [the  Charter] does  not simply  become  an  instrument  of better situated individuals  to  roll  back legislation which has as  its object  the improvement  of the condition of less  advantaged persons." Id.

99. This  step is  also referred  to  as "proportionality in  the  narrow  sense"  or  proportionality "stricto sensu." See Robert Alexy, Constitutional Rights,  Balancing,  and Rationality, 16  RATIo JURIs.  131,  135  (2003);  Stone  Sweet &amp; Mathews, supra note 37,  at 75; see also supra note 84.

measure, the more important  the objective must be  if  the measure is to  be reasonable and demonstrably  justified in afree  and democratic  society."'

Minimal  impairment analysis  is  defined  by the scope  of the  government's objective;  only  proportionality  as  such  "takes  full  account  of the  'severity of the deleterious  effects  of  a measure on individuals or  groups."*

Canadian  cases  rarely  turn  on this  third  step,  generally  finding  laws  unconstitutional on  minimal impairment grounds.1 2 Other jurisdictions,  however,  sometimes  find that  a  statute  that passes  minimal impairment  nonetheless fails  "proportionality  as  such."  In  Germany,  for  example,  "proportionality  as such"  has been used more  often than in Canada."13

While  "proportionality review"  requires  an initial determination  of  whether the government's purpose is sufficiently  important  to warrant restricting  rights at all,  in the final stage the relative strength  of that  interest  is  evaluated  in relation  to  the  specific  harm  to  rights;' 0 4 the  greater  the  intrusion  on  rights,  the

Chief Justice  McLachlin goes  on to  quote Aharon  Barak's argument:  "'Whereas  the  rational connection test and the least harmful  measure test are  essentially  determined  against  the  background  of the  proper  objective,  and are  derived from  the need  to  realize  it,  the  test  of proportionality (stricto sensu) examines whether  the realization of this proper  objective is commensurate with the deleterious  effect  upon the human right."'

102. See  id. ¶ 75-78 (acknowledging  that proportionality as such has  not had a strong independent role in  Canadian jurisprudence  to that point,  but suggesting that this should change  going forward).  Chief  Justice  McLachlin  explained:

Because  the minimal  impairment and proportionality  of effects  analyses  involve different kinds  of  balancing,  analytical  clarity and transparency  are well  served  by distinguishing between  them.  Where  no alternative means are reasonably capable of satisfying  the  government's  objective,  the  real  issue  is  whether  the  impact  of the  rights infringement  is  disproportionate  to the likely benefits  of the impugned law.  Rather  than  reading  down  the  government's  objective within  the minimal impairment analysis,  the court should acknowledge  that no  less drastic means  are available and proceed  to  the final stage of Oakes.

In response to  German scholar  Bernard  Schlink's argument that there  should not be proportionality  as  such  in  review  of legislation,  but  that  analysis  should  stop  with minimal  impairment,  Grimm has  argued  that one  must be able to  assess the  third stage  in order  to have  a basis for invalidating,  for example, a  statute providing  an authorization for property  owners to kill  another person, if there  is  no other way to protect  their property.

greater must be the need  and justification for the challenged  measure.  Consider an example  from  Israel, whose  case law sometimes  adopts  a particularly  rigorous  form  of analysis  of this  last  prong.  In  the Beit Sourik case,' 5 the  Israeli High  Court of Justice  found  that  the  government had  a  legitimate  purpose  in building  a  fence  to protect  Israelis  from violent  attacks  from  occupied  territory.1*6  The  Court  found  that  the  government's  choice  for  the  fence  location, near the top of a mountain, was a rational step towards  the goals  of  surveillance and  protecting  security  forces  and  travelers  on  a nearby  highway." 0 7 The  line drawn was also minimally impairing of  the  rights of Palestinians fenced off from their  lands  because  no  other  route  could  achieve  an  equivalent  level  of securityio8 The court explained  that a  "less  restrictive  means"  referred  only  to  an alternative that  equally  advances the  law's  purpose  while  intruding  less  on rights. 109 However,  the Court held, the fence  had to be moved  to a less elevated location,  allowing  Palestinians  more access  to their lands, because  the initial  location  failed  the  final,  "proportionality  as  such"  test:  the  marginal  improvement to security -and protection of the life of the Israeli  civilian -from the line that the  military  chose,  as  compared  to  a line  in  a  lower  location,  was,  in the Court's view,  far less  than  the  marginally  greater  intrusions on  Palestinian  humanitarian rights."

Not surprisingly,  the  U.S.  case  law  on  "less  restrictive  means"  sometimes obscures  the  distinction  between  "less  restrictive  means"  that  are  as  effective and those  that are  not, in part because  of the absence  of any separate  analysis of "proportionality  as  such."  Differing  formulations  can  elide whether  a  "less  restrictive  means"  must  be  one  that  achieves  equivalent  progress  towards  the government's legitimate  goal."'

1n. At times,  the Justices discuss  "less  restrictive  means" in  terms focusing on whether  the alternatives are equally effective  (as  the Israeli  Court did in Beit Sourik); at other times, U.S.  Justices  place emphasis  instead on  the lesser degree to which another  alternative would intrude on rights. See  infra note  113;  Alan  O.  Sykes, The Least Restrictive Means, 70 U. CHI.  L.  REv. 403  (2003); see also Noah Marks, Case Comment, "Least  Restrictive Means": Burwell v.

tive  alternatives"  tend  not  to  specify  whether  this  analysis  requires  that  the measures  being compared  "equally advance" the compelling  government  interest.  In United  States  v.  Alvarez (the  Stolen Valor Act  case),  the plurality accepted that an online  database against which false claims  could  be  checked  was  less  restrictive  than  a  criminal  prohibition  on  lying  about  receiving  the  Medal  of Honor." 2 The analysis  left  unclear whether the  plurality had concluded  that a database would be equally effective in carrying out the government's  legitimately relevant  interests,  or instead  that even  if the  database  were  less  effective, the database  would be  a  sufficient alternative given the relatively greater  importance  of  free  speech  concerns." 3 Similarly,  in McCullen  v. Coakley," 4 the U.S.  Court, in concluding  that a thirty-five-foot  buffer zone  was not sufficiently  tailored to  achieve  the  government's  legitimate  goal  of maintaining public safety  and preserving  access  to  abortion clinics,  left  unclear whether there were equally  effective alternatives  or  whether  the  marginal  additional  benefit  towards  the  government's  goal  under  the  statute,  as  compared  to  alternatives, was  unjustified in light of the  degree  of intrusion on rights."' By  contrast,  the relative  importance  of the rights and values  at stake  can be  distinctly evaluated in structured  proportionality analysis  at the "proportionality  as  such" stage.

113. See  id. (rejecting  the  government's  argument that  a  database would  be  "impracticable and insufficiently  comprehensive," as lacking  adequate  explanation).  Laurence Tribe has  recognized  that sometimes  a finding  that there is a less  restrictive alternative  represents  a hidden weighing  of  the  relative  proportionality  of  the  two  approaches. See LAURENCE  H.  TRIBE, AMERICAN  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW  722-23  (1978) ("Implicit  in  any  such  holding .. . is  a judgment  that  the  reduced  effectiveness entailed  by  a  less restrictive  alternative  is  outweighed  by  the increment in ... protection gained  by demanding such  an alternative."); cf Sykes, supra note  111, at 415-16 (arguing  that  in  WTO  adjudication,  the  less restrictive means  test operates as a  crude form of cost-benefit  balancing).  Some  Canadian  cases,  perhaps  reflecting  reluctance  to  rely  on  "proportionality as  such"  as  a  basis  for  invalidating  a statute,  may  similarly  combine  concerns  of proportionality  with  analysis  of  minimal  impairment, see Grimm, supra note 2, at  394-95,  though the Court has  recently  called  for more clarity as between  the two, see supra notes 102 &amp; 103.

A  striking  feature  of Canadian  jurisprudence  has  been  the  stability  of the proportionality  doctrine  and  its utility  as  a  method for  a structured  decisional analysis  in which the Justices  generally focus  on the same questions in the same order.1 6 (As  we shall  see,  Canadian  concerns  for proportionality  are found not only in formal Section  1 analyses  but  also  in  definitions  of the  scope  of certain rights." 7 )  Although  the  three  doctrinal  components  of proportionality  review of means are  similarly framed in most jurisdictions  that use  the  doctrine,  these elements  may be  applied somewhat  differently  by different  courts or judges.*S

116. This  is so  even where the Canadian Court is sharply divided. See, e.g., R. v.  Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R.  697,  734-38,  744-89, 790-96 (Can.)  (Dickson,  C.J.); id. at  844-67  (McLachlin,  J., dissenting); Quebec  (Att'y Gen.)  v.  A., [2013] 1 S.C.R.  61,  11 432-49 (Can.)  (McLachlin, C.J.); id.  ¶¶ 358-80  (Abella, J.,  dissenting in result). To be sure,  there  have been divergences in  the  rigor with which the categories of analysis  are applied,  and the development  of more and less  deferential approaches  to application  of the elements  of  the  proportionality  test. See Sujit  Choudhry, So  What Is the Real Legacy of Oakes? Two Decades of  Proportionality Analysis Under  the  Canadian Charter's Section 1, 34 SUP.  CT.  L.  REv.  (2d) 501  (2006). Choudhry  argues  that Oakes "created an enormous  institutional dilemma  for the Court,  by  setting up a conflict  between the  demand for definitive proof to  support each  stage of  the section i analysis,  and  the  reality  of policy making under conditions  of factual uncertainty,"  leading to  the development  of different  standards  of deference  in  areas  of factual  uncertainty,  applied  inconsistently. Id. at 503. Even if  Choudhry's analysis is correct,  the Oakes test has still considerably narrowed and structured the Canadian Court's analysis  of  Charter problems.

There  are, however,  a few  cases  where  the Canadian  Court has  split on the  question  of whether Oakes should apply at all; in  these cases, different  frameworks  are applied  by different  justices  in  the  same case. Compare,  e.g., Multani  v. Comm'n  Scolaire  MargueriteBourgeoys, [2006]  1 S.C.R. 256 (applying  Section  1  analysis,  rather than administrative  review principles), with Dord v. Barreau du Quebec, 2012 SCC 12,  [2012]  1 S.C.R. 395 (rejecting  Section 1  Oakes analysis  for review  of  challenged  administrative action). Under Dori, reviewing  courts are  to ask whether  the  administrative  "decision  reflects a  proportionate balancing of the Charter protections at  play." Id.  ¶ 57.  The inquiry in  reviewing  specific  administrative action is thus  itself designed  to  reflect  the  Charter  values  of Section 1: the administrative decision maker is to  "ask how the Charter value at issue will  best be protected  in view of the statutory  objectives . . . , [an inquiry]  at the core  of  the  proportionality  exercise, [which]  requires  the decision-maker to balance the  severity of  the  interference  of the Charter protection  with the  statutory  objectives." Id. q  56.  More  flexible  "Charter  values"  analyses, rather  than  the formal Oakes inquiry,  occur in  other areas  as well. See,  e.g., Hill v.  Church of Scientology  of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 (holding  that  the Charter  does not  apply  directly  to  the common law governing  private disputes,  but that Charter values  should inform the  balancing process  inherent  in the  development  of private  common  law); cf R.  v.  Clayton, 2007 SCC 32,  [2007]  2 S.C.R. 725 (adopting a  common law approach  to  defining Charter  Section 9  limits  on non-statutory  detention  powers,  implying  that this  approach  sufficiently  takes account  of Charter  values,  over  a concurrence  arguing  for  full  Section  1 Oakes analysis).

Nonetheless,  proportionality  doctrine  has  shown  itself capable  of providing  a stable framework  across  many controversial  issues,  in jurisdictions  widely  recognized as free  and democratic constitutional  states.

## II.  OF  OLDER  TEXTS,  CLAUSE-BOUND  INTERPRETATION,  AND NEGATIVE  PRECEDENTS

Despite  proportionality's appeal  in  other  countries  and  its partial  presence in  some  areas  of U.S.  constitutional  law,'" 9 the  Supreme  Court  treats  proportionality in different constitutional arenas  as unconnected.  Multiple accounts of the  relative  absence  of proportionality from  U.S.  constitutional  law  have  been offered."' As  later Parts will argue,  this relative absence  does  not mean  that the current  situation must remain  as it is,  nor are  the historic reasons  for its relative absence  reasons  against expanding its  use today.' 2 '  In this  Part,  I try to account for why  proportionality  as  a  general  principle  or  doctrine  has  not  emerged  in the United States.

There are  many factors  contributing  to the relative dearth  of  proportionality  analysis  in  U.S.  jurisprudence,  among  them  a general  propensity  for  what John Hart Ely  critically  referred  to  as  "clause-bound"  interpretation.'  Unlike

Likewise,  there  is  considerable  debate  even  among scholars  from jurisdictions  that invoke proportionality  as  to  its  merits. See  infra Part IV.A; Jackson, supra note  79, at  608-09  (noting  an early  debate  among  Canadian  scholars  about  the  Court's development  of the Oakes test).

Fallon, supra note 6,  at 1285  (arguing  that "strict scrutiny"  doctrine "is  not a timeless feature of constitutional  law, but rather a judicially developed  device  of  relatively  recent origin that even now could be abandoned by the Supreme  Court at any time");  Mark Tushnet, The Possibilities  of  Comparative Constitutional  Law, 1o8 YALE  L.J. 1225, 1227-28,  1280 (1999) (discussing  the  possibility  of comparison  in  illuminating  falsely  felt senses  of necessity,  while noting the difficulty of distinguishing true from false necessities).

some European  courts,  U.S.  constitutional  case  law  has  for the  most part  not aspired  to  general  theoretical  connections linking  constitutional  doctrines  in one  area  to  those  in  another. 12 ' Moreover,  from  a  comparative perspective, scholars  have observed  that balancing  or proportionality  in  Germany  is  associated with  rights protection  in a frame  of constitutional  perfectionism,  while  in the United  States balancing  is  associated  with pragmatic  ad hocery  and  limitations on rights.'``

Several  additional  reasons  relating to  the  age  of the  U.S.  Constitution  also help  account for why proportionality  has not emerged  as  an articulated  general constitutional  principle  or  doctrine. The  Constitution's  age  affects  both  the timing of case  law development and  the contents of constitutional  text.  Unlike the Canadian Charter of Rights (1982) or the  German Basic  Law (1949), many of the  Constitution's  rights  provisions  date  to  the  late  eighteenth  and  midnineteenth  centuries.  They  regularly  became  the  subject  of the  Court's interpretation in  the late nineteenth  and early twentieth centuries.  An evolving body of  U.S.  case law had  already developed  well before  the  atrocities of World War II  and  the  subsequent  explosion  of international  human  rights  law.  By  contrast, in Germany  (after 1949) and Canada (after  1982),  the highest courts were faced  with  new  rights-protecting  instruments,  framed  by  international  commitments  to human rights,  which provided an occasion for affording some  degree  of coherent  interpretation  to  new  constitutional  instruments. 1 2 The  U.S. Constitution, moreover,  has  no general  limitations clause,  unlike  many modern constitutions.' 6 Such  limitations  clauses  can provide  a  textual  basis  for  a gen-

eral  doctrine  of how  to justify  the  infringement  of rights, though  they are  not necessarily the foundation for courts doing so.127

As an older constitution,  moreover,  the U.S.  Constitution  (as  conventionally understood)  contains  fewer  rights  and thus  gives  rise  to fewer  occasions  for conflicts  between  constitutional principles than many  newer  constitutions. This  is  especially  true  for  modern  constitutions  that enforce  both  older  liberal rights  and  newer  positive  rights.12 8 Where  constitutional  rights  are  many  and are  viewed  as  "principles"  requiring  optimization,  as  in  Germany,  approaches that seek to  give  each principle  its proportional  due are  likely  to be  of  great appeal. 2 9 In  the United States,  conflicts  between  constitutional  values -like free press  versus  fair  trial-exist but  are  perceived  to  arise  less  often.  This  in  part reflects  the  relative  terseness  of the Constitution  and its failure  to  include positive  rights  as  such.  But  it  also  reflects  the  predominantly  negative  contemporary view of those rights  that do exist."'  The  Court has  resisted arguments that would  impose positive  obligations  on  the  government  to enable  the realization of rights,  except  in  limited  categories,  such  as  the  rights  to  counsel  and  to  appeal  in criminal  cases.  There  are  accordingly  fewer  perceived  conflicts  in rights and thus less felt  need to  find ways  of reconciling  such conflicts."' The  absence of positive  obligations  also  affects  other  aspects  of U.S.  doctrine,  in ways  that

130. This "negative-only"  view of the  rights protected has  not always  been clearly  dominant. See, e.g., Archibald Cox, The Supreme Court, 1965 Term -Foreword:  Constitutional Adjudication and the Promotion  of Human Rights, 80 HARv.  L.  REv. 91 (1966) (arguing  that a theme  of recent cases has  been the need  for affirmative action,  in contrast with  prior practice,  to  advance  the goal of equality); Frank I. Michelman, The Supreme Court, 1968 Term-Foreword:  On Protecting the  Poor through the Fourteenth  Amendment, 83  HARv. L. REv.  7 (1969) (arguing  that  recent  decisions  should be  understood  as  reflecting  a  duty to  secure  minimum  levels  of welfare).

131. It is perhaps  not a  coincidence  that Justice  Breyer,  in some cases  in which  he  has argued  for some  form of proportionality  review  of statutes,  has  also seen  in  those  cases  First Amendment interests  on both  sides. See,  e g., Nixon  v.  Shrink  Mo.  Gov't PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 400 (2000) (Breyer,  J.,  concurring)  ("[C]onstitutionally  protected  interests  lie  on  both sides  of the  legal  equation..  . .").

call  for  caution  in  considering  methodological  shifts  that are  more  than  incremental  in character. 3 2

There  are  other contributing factors  apart from the  text and  age of the U.S. Constitution.  Unlike  countries  in Europe,  the  United  States  is  not  nested  in  a tightly woven  supranational  structure  of economic  union,  nor  deeply  embedded  in an  effective  regional  human  rights  convention,  enforced  by  a  transnational  court.  Courts  in  Europe  have  incentives  to  draw  on,  and  to  anticipate, rulings  of the  two  European  courts,  each  of which  relies  on  forms  of proportionality review.  Unlike  Canada, the United  States is  not part of the Commonwealth,  which  has  arguably  promoted  more  sharing  of jurisprudences  across national  lines.  U.S.  courts  thus  have  not  experienced  to  the  same  degree  the flow of cases  from national  to  supranational  courts  that  is  common  in Europe, nor  the  regular  interchange  that occurs  among judges  of the Commonwealth nations. 133 Its  relative  isolation  from  these  influences,  or those  of international tribunals,  is  reflected  both  in  the  hesitation  of the  political  branches  to  ratify human rights conventions, 3 4 and in the Supreme  Court's recent  case law. 3 1

Over  time,  moreover,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  developed  distinctive discourses  around  rights.  U.S.  law does  not generally  discuss  rights  as  being subject  to  external  limitation;  when  U.S.  jurists, lawyers,  or  scholars  say  a "right"  has been  "infringed,"  this  is  typically  the end of analysis.13 6 In  Canada,

132. In the  United  States,  even "compelling  interests" sufficient  to  overcome  presumptive  rights protections  are  optional,  in  the  sense  that  governments  may  choose  whether  or  not  to  advance them;  in Germany,  by contrast,  the  Basic Law  is understood  to  impose some  affirmative duties  on government. See JACKSON, supra note 118,  at 222-23.

133. See  id. at 40-41, 55-57, 91-94, 95-97, 99-102,  154,  261 (discussing  European  integration and the Commonwealth).

135. See,  e.g., cases  cited supra note 38.

136. This approach  is often associated with  the idea that rights act  like "trumps" over other interests  against  government  action. See DwORKIN, supra note 34,  at  xi  (calling  rights  "political trumps  held by individuals");  Ronald  Dworkin, Rights as Trumps, in THEORIES OF  RIGHTS 153, 166  (Jeremy Waldron ed., 1984) (describing  rights  as  "trumps  over  some background justification for  political  decisions  that  states  a goal  for  the  community  as  a whole"  and  arguing  that rights  are needed  "only when  some  decision  that injures  some people  nevertheless finds prima-facie  support  in the claim that it will  make the community  as a whole better off');  see also Gregoire  Webber, On the Loss of  Rights, in PROPORTIONALITY AND  THE RuLE OF LAw:  RIGHTS, JUSTIFICATION, REASONING  123 (Grant  Huscroft et al.  eds., 2014). But cf Fallon, supra note  6,  at 1316-17 (distinguishing  "triggering  rights," which  prompt  strict scrutiny,  from  "ultimate" rights);  Gardbaum, supra note  5,  at 423-25 (noting  instances  where  the U.S.  Supreme  Court has identified a "two-step  analysis" of rights' infringement  and of  justifications  for limits).  Gardbaum  suggests  that without a  textual  limitations  clause,  "[w]here all  limits  are  judicially  implied,  it is  far  easier  to  justify  such  implication  if all  limits  are thought of as part of  the first step, part  of  the  undoubtedly  legitimate judicial function  of  in-

the  scope of interests  that  the right protects  is  determined  first from  the  perspective  of the  rights-holder;  if the  "right"  is  infringed,  analysis  does  not end, but instead the government's reasons  for limitation  are then separately  considered.  Likewise,  in  Germany,  according  to  a leading  scholar  of proportionality review, rights  that  are  "principles"  are  understood  to  be  "optimization"  requirements  which  must  be  protected  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  but which may be limited if there are  strong enough  reasons  for the government to do so.1 37 In the United States,  courts often  blend the two ideas -which personal  interests  a  right protects,  and  how  the  government  may  legitimately  act  to limit freedom-- and articulate  a "right"  only after internally accounting  for  limitations  deemed warranted by the government interests., 8

At the same  time,  there  are  distinctively  American  fears  about judging  and the role  of  judges,  in part  an inheritance  of legal  realism and critical  legal  studies  (CLS).  This  kind  of  skepticism  about  law,  judging,  and  judges  contrasts with German (and European)  forms of  optimism about the possibility of  law as a practice  distinct from  politics. 1 39 If legal realism  and  CLS  contribute to  a gen- terpreting  the meaning and scope  of  a constitutional  right,  rather than ... part of the  second step of specifying when the  right as defined may be overridden." Id. at 426.

137. Robert Alexy famously characterized  most rights  as principles,  to be  understood  as "optimization  requirements,"  whose  mandate -to optimally protect those  rights -must be evaluated against the  government's efforts or obligation to  advance  and protect against other rights and interests.

In Canada,  by contrast,  the Court first asks  whether  the  interests  advanced by the challenger are protected  by the substantive Charter provision relied  on before  analyzing  the  government's justifications  for  its  action  (although  there  is  debate  over  the  role  of particular  considerations  in  the  Section  15  equality  analysis  as  compared  with the  Section  1 justification  analysis).

eral  skepticism  about  the  capacity  of law  to  constrain,  then  fears  of judging were  also  reinforced  by what  we  might  call  the  ghosts  of Lochner14 0 and Dennis, 4 ' two cases  that  have come  to  be viewed  as  "negative  precedents,"  or cautionary  notes of what not to repeat.w2

As  Richard Fallon has  argued, Carolene  Products laid  the  foundation  for the Court  to  develop  bifurcated  categories  of review,  including  more  deferential review of economic  regulation  and heightened  review of laws adversely  affecting  discrete  and  insular  minorities,  the  representative  process,  or  the  protections of the  first eight  amendments. 3 The vices  of Lochner are debated,''4  but Carolene  Products, and  the ensuing  bifurcation  of standards  of review  into  rational basis  and  strict scrutiny,  responded  to  two  major  critiques of  Lochner by creating  a  clear hierarchy  of rights:  it  rejected  liberty of contract  as  an object  of heightened attention and  seemed to limit judicial  intrusion on political choices, confining judicial  discretion  by "committing"  the  Court to  two discrete  standards  of review,4 5 each  of which  was  close  to  outcome  determinative -strict scrutiny almost always fatal;  rational basis  rarely  so.46

Yet over  time,  the persuasive,  predictive,  and  constraining  force  of this  bifurcation  diminished.  The  concept  of a  rigid  division  in  standards  of review was implicitly  challenged  in Justice  Thurgood Marshall's 1970 dissent  in Dan-

(2004) (contrasting  the  U.S.  commitment  to  popular  will with  the  European  commitment to reason).

If  a  reaction  to  Lochnerism  helps  explain  the  initial  development  of  the two-tiered  structure of review  signaled  in Carolene Products, the perceived  failure of balancing  to  provide  appropriate protection  to  First Amendment  interests  in Dennis"' may have  contributed to  the development  of more  categorical approaches  to  restrictions  on  speech  inciting  violence, as in Brandenburg v. Ohio.15 6 Such  developments in turn have  contributed to  the  notion  that U.S. constitutional  law  more  generally  rests  or  should  rest  on  categorical  rules. 157 Concerns  for  proportionate government  action  may,  however, have  informed the development  of Brandenburg's categorical  rule.i5 8 Exceptions  to free  speech rules  in recent  years,  including Holder v.

As even  our more  categorical  constitutional  rules have become  increasingly uncertain  and  complex,1 6 2  is  this  a  time  for  some  reorientation  of U.S.  law  towards  proportionality?

Ohio, 367  U.S.  643,  655 (1961), applying  the  Fourth Amendment  exclusionary  rule  to  the  states  to  hold  that "all  evidence  obtained  by  searches and seizures  in violation  of the Constitution  is . . . inadmissible," and Miranda v.  Arizona, 384 U.S. 436  (1966),  providing bright-line rules  for the treatment of in-custody  suspects  before  they  could be  interrogated. See generally David A.  Strauss, The Ubiquity of Prophylactic Rules,  55  U. CHI.  L.  REv. 190 (1988) (describing  the Miranda Court's  prophylactic  approach).  Similarly categorical  rules  to  protect criminal  defendants' constitutional  rights  developed in other areas. See Jeffrey  L.  Fisher, Categorical  Requirements in Constitutional  Criminal  Procedure, 94 GEO.  L.J. 1493,  1500-01  (2006). These  rules,  however, became  complicated by numerous  exceptions  (and an increased  rhetoric  of  balancing), see id. at 1502-03, notably in  exceptions  to  the  Fourth  Amendment  exclusionary  rule, see Carol  S. Steiker, CounterRevolution in  Constitutional Criminal  Procedure? Two  Audiences,  Two  Answers, 94 MICH.  L. REv.  2466, 2504-20 (1996).  If the Warren  Court's criminal  procedure decisions  migrated from  standards  to  rules  that  sought  to  ease  administrability  and  deter  police  misconduct, more recent cases  have  developed other  bright lines  to protect  police  misconduct  from judicial  review. See,  e.g., Atwater  v.  City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S.  318 (2001) (holding that  other circumstances  are  irrelevant  to  the  validity  of an  arrest  once  an  officer  has  probable  cause based  on what  he  saw  to  believe  an  offense  was  committed);  Whren v.  United  States, 517 U.S.  8o6  (1996)  (holding  that a police  officer's  subjective intentions  are  irrelevant to  evaluating the constitutionality  of a traffic  stop, as is a violation of  local  regulations).

## III.  BENEFITS  OF  PROPORTIONALITY  REVIEW  FOR  U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW

In this  Part, I  argue  that  in at least two  areas  of constitutional  law,  greater reliance  on proportionality  would beneficially  enhance  the protection  of individual  rights.  Working from  the facts  to  the  law  in the common law  tradition, Part A considers  recent Fourth Amendment case law in which the Court rejected  arguments  that  arrests,  or  searches  related  to pretrial  detention,  should  be limited  by  proportionality principles,  and  it  contrasts  such  decisions with  Canadian case  law.  Part B explores  how the  absence  of a "proportionality  as such" inquiry diminishes  the force  of U.S.  rules  against content-based regulation  under strict scrutiny,  using Humanitarian  Law Project as  an example.  Finally,  Part C  advances some  more  general, theoretical arguments  for  increased  use  of structured proportionality review and proportionality as  a principle  in constitutional adjudication.

## A.  Regulating  Police  Behavior Under  Constitutional  Norms

## 1. Atwater v.  City of Lago Vista and Fourth  Amendment Case Law

In Atwater v.  City of  Lago  Vista,1 6 1 the  Court  found  no  Fourth Amendment violation  in the  arrest  of a  motorist for a non-jailable  traffic  offense. 6 4  Atwater was  driving  her  two  young  children  in  their  neighborhood  when  she  was stopped by a police officer  for not wearing her seatbelt and not having her children  in  seatbelts. 6 5  Arresting  Atwater,  the officer  denied  her  request  to ask a neighbor  to  care  for the  children,  indicating  that he  would bring  them  to the police  station. 6 6 Atwater's hands were  cuffed behind  her back;  she  was  placed in the  back  of the  police  car-without a  seatbelt-and  driven  to the  station. 6 7

165. Id. at 323-24. The  officer  shouted at Ms.  Atwater  "We've met before,"  and "You're going to jail!";  he  had previously  stopped  her  in  the  same  neighborhood,  mistakenly  thinking  she had  commited  a  seat  belt offense. Id. at 324 &amp;  n.1;  Atwater  v.  City  of Lago  Vista, 195 F. 3 d 242,  252 (5th  Cir. 1999) (Dennis, J.,  dissenting); see  also id. at  248  (Wiener,  J.,  dissenting) (stating  that the  facts  would  have supported  a jury verdict  that  the  officer  had  "a personal crusade  or  possibly even  a vendetta"); id. at 246  (Garza,  J.,  dissenting)  (asserting  that  as  a Texas lawyer for sixty years  and an Article III judge in  Texas  for thirty-eight  years,  he knew that ordinarily  a traffic  stop  like  this would  result in a citation  and concluding  that  the officer acted unreasonably and in violation of the  Fourth Amendment).

She  was  released  about  an hour later,  paid  a $50 fine  for the  seat  belt offense, and discovered her car had been towed. 68 She sued for damages,  including  distress-related  medical  costs for herself and one child. 69

The Court described the police officer's conduct  in arresting the motorist as involving  "merely  gratuitous  humiliations"  and  inflicting  "pointless  indignity and confinement."' 70 Indeed,  the  Court wrote, her claim "clearly  outweighs anything the City  can raise  against it  specific  to her case."' 7 '  Acknowledging  that "[ilf  we  were to  derive a rule exclusively  to address the uncontested  facts of this case, Atwater might well prevail," the  Court noted  that Atwater  was  an "established resident  of  Lago Vista with no place  to  hide and  no incentive  to flee,  and common  sense  says  she would  almost  certainly have  buckled  up  as a  condition  of driving off  with a citation."' 72

Yet  the  Court  rejected  Atwater's  Fourth  Amendment  challenge:  history suggested  and  functional  concerns  required  that  police  officers  be  treated  as having  lawful  discretion  to  arrest  for any offense  with  probable  cause. 73  To hold  otherwise,  according  to  the  Court,  would  impose  unwarranted  burdens on  police  officers  of knowing  details  of criminal  codes  and  anticipating  likely charging  decisions,  thereby  creating  incentives  to  under-enforce  criminal  law by officers  making  split-second  decisions.' 74 (A similar  structure  of analysis  is found  in Florence  v.  Board  of Chosen  Freeholders,' 5 involving visual strip and cavity searches  at pretrial  detention facilities. 176)

176. The Florence Court described  how,  after passing  through a metal  detector,  all  arriving detainees

were  instructed  to remove  their  clothing  while  an officer  looked  for body  markings, wounds, and contraband. Apparently without touching the detainees,  an officer  looked  at  their ears,  nose,  mouth,  hair,  scalp, fingers,  hands,  arms, armpits, and other body openings.  This policy  applied  regardless  of the circumstances  of the  arrest,  the  suspected  offense,  or the  detainee's  behavior,  demeanor,  or criminal history.  Petitioner alleges  he was  required  to lift his genitals,  turn around, and cough in a squatting position as part of the process.

Id. at 1514 (citations  omitted).  Petitioner  argued  that  the  detention  facility  should sort  pretrial  detainees  accused  of more serious  offenses  from  those  accused of less  serious offenses and graduate  the intrusiveness of the searches  accordingly,  unless there was  some particular basis for suspicion  that an arrestee  might be concealing  dangerous  substances.  In Florence, as

If  a case  like Atwater had  arisen  in Canada,  the first  question the Canadian Court would  likely  have  addressed  is  whether  the  plaintiff had  interests  protected  by  the  provisions  analogous  to  the  Fourth  Amendment."  The  first question  in fact  addressed by  the Atwater Court was the  scope of common  law authority  to  make  an arrest.7" Had  the  U.S.  Court  followed  the  structured proportionality  review  approach,  it would  have  considered  whether Atwater's interests  were  within  the  scope  of interests  protected  by  the  Fourth  Amendment before  going  on  to consider whether  the  search  or  seizure was  justified, that is,  reasonable.  The  amendment's text plainly  suggests  that  searches  and seizures  must be  reasonable.  It provides:  "The  right of the people  to be  secure in their persons  ... against unreasonable searches  and  seizures,  shall  not be violated,  and no Warrants  shall  issue,  but upon  probable  cause . ... "179 The  U.S. Supreme  Court did not conduct  its analysis  in this order.  Moreover,  it did not address  potential  harm to Atwater's children. "'o

Whether  "the people"  can  feel  "secure  in  their persons"  knowing  that any traffic  infraction can  result in their being jailed  deserves  more attention.  Justifications  that sound only in authority, based on common  law practice,  are not so in Atwater, the Court  rejected  arguments  that a  more  individualized  approach was  constitutionally  required  to  avoid  disproportionately  humiliating  or  intrusive  treatment. See  id. at 1517-18 (citing Atwater, 532 U.S. at  347, for  the  proposition  that  "a  responsible  Fourth Amendment  balance is not well served  by standards  requiring sensitive,  case-by-case  determinations of government need").

177. In resolving  the threshold  question of Charter Section  8,  whether a "search"  or "seizure" has occurred,  the Canadian  Court  considers  whether  the  challenger  had  a "reasonable  expectation of privacy,"  R.  v.  Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128,  ¶130-39 (Can.);  for Section  9,  in  resolving the threshold  question whether a challenger was "detained,"  the Court  asks whether a  reasonable  person in  the position  of the  accused  would feel  she  was  free  to  go  or had  to comply with police  requests,  considering  both physical and psychological coercion. See R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32,  [2009]  2 S.C.R.  353,  ¶¶ 20-21,  24-29 (Can.).
178. 532 U.S. at 326-40.
179. U.S. CONST. amend.  v (emphasis added).
180.  Although  harm to  third  parties might  seem  obviously  relevant to  determining  the  reasonableness  of a search  or  seizure,  in Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S.  Ct. 2012,  2022 (2014), the Court held  that  the  presence  of a  passenger  in  a  car  driven  by  a  fleeing  felon  was  irrelevant  to whether  the  felon's Fourth Amendment  rights  had  been violated  when  police  fired  fifteen shots into the vehicle.  The  Court's reasoning  was  that Fourth  Amendment  rights  are  personal, not vicarious. Id. Under proportionality  analysis,  or  any  substantive  analysis  of reasonableness,  it  is  hard  not to  think that  the  possibility  of "collateral"  injury  bears  on  the "reasonableness"  of the  police  officers'  actions. See, e.g.,  R. v.  Thompson, [1990] S.C.R. 1111,  1143-45 (Can.)  (noting  that failure  to take  steps to prevent  wiretapping of many members  of the public's conversation  is  a basis  for finding "unreasonableness"  of  a  search  under Section 8).  Subsequent  Canadian case  law holds that  third-party interests  are not relevant to whether  the claimant  was  subject  to a  "search  or seizure"  but  may  well  be  "relevant  in the second stage  of [Section  8]  analysis,  namely whether  the search was conducted  in a  reasonable manner." Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 1q  34-38.

persuasive  to  the  modern  ear;  and  proportionality  tests  do  not  stop with  the question  of authorization.' The  Court's  methodology, which  defined  the rights  at  stake  only  in  relation  to  an  ambiguous  common  law  history and  its analysis  of the  government's interests,  left  an  essential  aspect  of the question under-explored.

The Atwater Court  did engage  in  some  balancing  or  weighing  of govern 7 ment needs  in deciding  between  a case-by-case  or  rule-based  approach,  and  it chose a categorical  rule.  The Court treated police officers as  needing prophylactic protection,  reasoning  that "a  responsible  Fourth Amendment  balance  is  not well  served  by  standards  requiring  sensitive,  case-by-case  determinations  of government  need,  lest  every  discretionary  judgment  in  the field  be  converted into  an  occasion for constitutional review.",,S2 The  Court made  empirical  judgments-concerning  the  supposed  dearth  of  abusive  arrests  and  the  need  to avoid "a  systematic disincentive  to arrest" -in order to strike "a responsible  ... balance"  through its categorical  rule.'""

As  the dissenters  argued,  qualified  immunity doctrine already protects  officials  from  monetary  liability  under  unclear  legal  standards.' 8 4  Some  focus  on the proportionality  of the officer's conduct,  examining the reasons  for this conduct,  would  have  little  potential  for  interference  with  law  enforcement  and would  better  protect  citizens'  rights  to  be  secure  in  their  persons.'1 5 Yet  the Court offered little discussion  of the scope  of the  interests protected  by Fourth Amendment rights or of why the police officer did not use less  restrictive  alternatives  reasonably  available  to  him; its  suggestion  that  the  political  process could  control  abuses,' 5 6 and  its  reference  to  a  possibly  different  approach  in "extraordinary"  circumstances,i87 left  the  decision  only  partially  justified  and partially  transparent.

181. See BARAK, supra note 22, at 107-24 (discussing  the  requirement  of authority  for  limiting rights, as an inquiry  that precedes  proportionality  analysis  of the means  used); id. at 243-454 (discussing  the elements of proper purpose,  rational  connection,  minimal impairment,  and proportionality  as  such); cf BEATTY, supra note i, at 45-46 (discussing  how  the German Constitutional  Court  seeks  to "evaluate  and reconcile  the competing  interests"  rather than to rely on textual  exegesis  or case  law).

## 2. A Canadian  Comparison

For comparison,  let's turn  briefly to  a recent  Canadian  decision 88 concerning the Canadian  Charter's constitutional  protections of the "right to be  secure against unreasonable  search  or seizure"89  and  "the  right  not  to  be  arbitrarily detained or  imprisoned." 1 90 In Aucoin, a  Canadian  police  officer  made  a  traffic stop because  of a license  plate  irregularity;  on  questioning  the  nineteen-yearold driver,  the officer  found that he had consumed alcohol in violation of traffic laws  prohibiting new  drivers  from  drinking.' 9 '  Having  decided  to  give  the driver a ticket,  the officer  also  decided to  place the driver in the back of  the police  car  while  he wrote  up  the  citation.1 92 For  safety  reasons,  the  officer  conducted  a pat-down  search before putting the driver in the back of the patrol  car and  during  that  search  discovered  illegal  drugs.' The parties  and  the  Court agreed  that the initial detention  of the  driver in the traffic stop was lawful.  The question  was whether  the decision  to put  the driver in the  back seat  of the patrol car was  a reasonable  exercise  of  the authority  to detain.1 94

In  the  Canadian  Court's words,  the  issue  was  not whether  there  was  authority to detain,  but whether  the  officer  was justified in exercising the authority as he did.' 9 5 It was the "shift in  the nature  and extent of... detention"  for "two relatively  minor motor vehicle  infractions" that created  the constitutional  viola-

194. See  id.  ¶ 30. Aucoin challenged  the lawfulness  of the pat-down  search,  which  in this factual context,  turned  on whether  under Section  9  of the  Canadian  Charter,  "securing  the appellant in the cruiser . . . was reasonably  necessary";  the Court  found that it was  not,  and thus there was no authority  for the pat-down search. Id.  ¶¶ 30,  44; see infra note 201. The issue  in the  case  was  the  reasonableness  of the  officer's  actions, not  whether  a  statute found  to infringe  a  Charter right  could  be "salvaged"  by  a Section 1  proportionality analysis; the Court's application  of the reasonable  necessity  requirement  for detentions  under Section  9 incorporates  concern for the proportionality  of police  actions. See Aucoin, [2012]  3 S.C.R.  ¶ 44;  R.  v. Clayton, 2007 SCC 32,  [2007]  2 S.C.R. 725, ¶ 21 (Can.).

Rather,  the  question  is whether he was justified in exercising  it as he did in the circumstances  of this case."); cf R.  v.  Collins, [1987] S.C.R. 265, 278 (Can.)

[and]  altered  the nature and  extent of the  appellant's detention in a fairly  dramatic  way-especially  when  one  considers that  the  infractions  for which  he  was  being  detained  consisted  of two  relatively  minor  motor  vehicle infractions."' 97 Given  the minor character  of the  offense,  the decision  to detain in  the car  did not  meet  the  test of being  "reasonably  necessary"  under  all  the circumstances, and  so  the  detention  and  accompanying  pat-down  were  not constitutional.ig8  The  Canadian Court was unanimous  in this holding. 199

198. See id. 15 36-42 (evaluating  reasonable  necessity  "in the totality of the circumstances"  of the particular  case).  The  Court  also  noted  that  there were  less  intrusive  alternatives  available, including waiting for  back-up  (which  was  "close  at  hand")  before  writing  the  ticket. Id.  ¶ 42. It added that "a different  factual  matrix may  well have supported a finding of reasonable necessity," id. ¶43,  consistent with  Canadian  case  law's emphasis  that the question whether a detention  is  "reasonably  necessary"  is a highly contextual  one. See Clayton, [2007]  2 S.C.R. 5 31 (explaining  the  need  to consider "the  nature  of the situation,  including  the seriousness of the  offence, . . . information  known to the  police about the  suspect or  the crime,  and the extent  to which  the detention  was reasonably  responsive or tailored to  these  circumstances," in order to "balanc[e]  the seriousness  of the risk to public or individual  safety with the liberty interests  of  members  of the public to  determine whether,  given the extent  of the risk, the nature  of the  stop  is  no  more intrusive  of liberty  interests  than  is  reasonably  necessary  to address  the risk").

Scholarly  commentary to  date  on Aucoin has  mostly focused on the exclusion from evidence question  and criticized  the majority for  allowing the  evidence in.

2. zoo.  Although  concern  for effective  crime  control  lies behind  the U.S.  Supreme  Court's analysis in  many cases, including  Atwater, it is  difficult to  determine  the  relationship of particular legal  approaches  to  effective  crime  control or levels  of  criminal  activity.  For comparative  analysis  of  the  U.S.  and  Canadian  criminal  justice  systems,  see,  for  example,  Marc  Ouimet, Crime in Canada  and the  United States:  A  Comparative  Analysis, 36  CAN. REV. Soc.  389, 405 (2008) (describing  the  role  of gun  ownership  and  residential  patterns  as  determinants  of criminal  activity).  While  property  crime  rates  may  be  higher  in Canada,  Ouimet, supra, at

suggests  that  some  form  of more  individualized  proportionality  analysis  may produce  decisions  that  are both  better  reasoned  and  more  protective  of rights than the  "categorical  approach" employed  by the U.S. Court." 1

## B. "Strict  Scrutiny" and the First  Amendment

The First Amendment  is an area  in which U.S.  law  is  typically described  as being  based  on  presumptive  or  definitional  categories. 2 " 2 Would  U.S.  First Amendment  law be improved  by more attention  to proportionality?  If,  for example,  in applying  the  categorical  presumption  against  content-based  regulation, courts used as an  additional  test the question of "proportionality as  such" from  structured  proportionality  doctrine?  Or  if,  in  defining  exemptions  from the  categorical  presumption  against content-based  regulation,  more  attention were given  to the principle  of proportionality?  To begin  to  answer  these  questions,  consider  first the  Court's recent  decision  in Holder  v.  Humanitarian  Law Project.20s

The  case  involved  a  challenge to  a  criminal  statute  prohibiting  material support  to  designated  terrorist  groups.  The  challenge  was  brought  by  U.S.-

405, Canadians  are less  likely  to  be the  victims  of homicide,  aggravated  assault,  or  robbery than  are residents  of the  United  States, see Maire  Gannon, Juristat, Crime Comparisons  Between  Canada  and the  United States, JURISTAT  (Can.  Centre  for  Just.  Stat.,  Can.),  Dec.  18, 2001, at 2, 4; Ouimet, supra, at 405, and have greater  trust and confidence in  the police than do Americans, see Sanja  Kutnjak Invkovic, A  Comparative  Study of Public  Support  for the Police, 18 INT'L CRIM. JUST.  REv. 406, 422,  425  (2008); Julian  V.  Roberts, Public Confidence in Criminal  Justice in Canada:  A  Comparative  and Contextual  Analysis, 49  CAN. J.  CRIMINOLOGY &amp; CRIM.  JUST. 153, 167-68 (2007). By contrast,  U.S.  governments  were  reported to expend more per capita  on policing  and criminal justice than  did Canada. See Frans van Dijk &amp; Jaap de Waard, Key Findings  from  the  Study Legal  Infrastructure  of the  Netherlands  in  International Perspective:  Crime Control,  8 EUR. J. ON CRIM. POL'Y &amp; RES. 517, 523  (2000).

201. Aucoin found infringements  of Charter Sections  8 and 9,  but it did not  go on to ask whether the actions  were  nonetheless  justified under  Section I. The  infringement  of Section  9  arose because the detention  in the car and accompanying patdown  were  not reasonably necessary; Section  8  was  therefore  violated  because  the  search  was  not authorized  by law,  which  also precluded  justification  under  Section 1. The  leading  Canadian  constitutional  law  treatise states that although the  author  believes  Section  1  may apply  to salvage  a Section  8  infringement,  "there is  no  illustrative  case."  PETER  HOGG,  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW  OF  CANADA  48-2 (5th  ed. 2007). To  uphold  such an  infringement  of Section  8  under  Section 1, one  would have to find  that it was "demonstrably justified" to  act in  a manner determined  to have been unreasonable -a logical conundrum.

based  NGOs  that  sought,  inter  alia,  to  provide  training  to  certain designated terrorist  groups  (such as  the  Kurdistan  Workers'  Party  (PKK)  in  Turkey) about  how to invoke  international  law processes to  advance  their claims.  Concluding  that  the  statute  involved  a  content-based  regulation  of  speech,  the Court  nonetheless  upheld  the  statute  in  light  of the  government's interest  in combatting terrorism.4

The protective  power  of the categorical  approach  is  called  into  question  by this decision.  The Court in Humanitarian  Law failed even to mention an arguably controlling decision from 1969, Brandenburg  v.  Ohio,"os which had held that speech  believed  to  incite  violence  could  be  banned  only  when  the  speech's character  was  an  incitement  to  imminent  action  and  likely  to  cause  imminent lawlessness. Under  Brandenburg, it would have been difficult to uphold the material  support  statute  as  applied to speech  designed  only to promote  lawful  invocations  of international  procedures,  as  the  speech  had neither  the purpose  of inciting  nor a  likelihood of causing imminent lawlessness.20 6

As noted,  the Humanitarian  Law Court concluded that the statute  regulated speech based on its content;  it therefore  subjected the statute to strict scrutiny, rejecting  the  government's  argument  for  intermediate scrutiny.217  The  Court indicated  that  the  correct  standard  to apply  was  "the  more  rigorous  scrutiny" found  in such cases  as Cohen v.  California,20s Texas v.  Johnson, 2 ' 9 and R.A.V.  v.

205. 395 U.S.  444 (1969). Brandenburg had seemingly  brought to  a  stable  end the  Court's halfcentury  struggle  to  reconcile  government  efforts  to  suppress  speech  believed  to  be  dangerous to  the government  with  the First  Amendment's protections  of freedom  of expression. For an account of that struggle,  see GEOFFREY R. STONE ET AL.,  CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  107076 ( 7 th ed. 2013) and sources  cited therein.

See Humanitarian  Law Project, 561 U.S.  at 44 (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting)  ("No one  contends that the plaintiffs' speech  to these  organizations  can  be prohibited  as  incitement  under Brandenburg."); Field, supra note  16o,  at 438.  Another  line  of cases,  arising  out  of anti-Communist laws  of  the  195os,  suggested  that under First Amendment freedom of association,  the  constitutionality of punishing membership  in an organization with some unlawful  goals depended on  whether  the  membership  was  "active,"  in  the  sense  of intending  to  aid  in  the accomplishment of those unlawful  goals.  Scales  v.  United  States,  367  U.S. 203,  229-30  (1961); see also Field, supra note  16o, at 437. Under  this line  of  cases,  it was argued in Humanitarian  Law Project that plaintiffs could  not  be  sanctioned  for  providing  assistance  toward  the  lawful goals  of designated  terrorist  organizations; the Court,  however,  did  not apply  this  line of cases either,  suggesting that the statute  did not bar "membership"  or discussion but only the provision of "training"  or other  "services," 561 U.S. at  18.

City of  St.  Paul.` Although the Court was less  than clear  on precisely what that standard was,  it appeared  to  be  "strict scrutiny." 2 1 The  parties  all  agreed  that combatting  terrorism  was  a  compelling  government  interest.  The Court  emphasized  that  the prohibition  was  narrow,  insofar  as  it  did not prohibit  "independent"  advocacy,  and  applied  only  to  "knowing"  support. 1 2 As  applied  to teaching  terrorist groups how  to petition  international  agencies,  the Court concluded,  the  ban  was  sufficiently  connected  to  combatting  terrorism  for  three reasons:  to prevent the freeing up of  "fungible"  resources  that could be directed to  unlawful  acts;  to  obstruct  terrorist  groups  from  acquiring  "legitimacy"; 3 and  to  avoid  difficulties  in relationships  with  allies  in  the fight  against  terrorism. 214 In  responding  to plaintiffs' argument that there was no  need to prohibit

213. Id. at 30. Moreover, the Court reasoned, teaching international  law to terrorist  groups could be  prohibited because  "[a]  foreign terrorist organization  introduced  to the  structures of the international  legal system  might use the information  to threaten,  manipulate,  and disrupt." Id. at 37. The potential  for disruptive,  manipulative use  of  legal knowledge  is,  however, pervasively present.
214. Id. at 32-33. As  the  dissent notes, preventing  "legitimacy"  is  a doubtfully  legitimate  goal  of statutes prohibiting  speech;  and the other two goals  had little empirical  support with respect to  activities  like  those  of the  plaintiffs. Id. at 47-52 (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting).  It is,  moreover, unclear  whether  Congress  intended the  statute to  apply  to  the plaintiffs' activities:  the statute  itself,  18  U.S.C.  § 2339B(i) (2012), states  that  "[n]othing  in this  section  shall  be construed or applied  so as  to abridge  the exercise  of rights  guaranteed  under the  First Amendment."  The government  had  argued  aggressively  that  the statute  was not a  content-based regulation  of  speech,  but only a regulation  of  conduct with incidental  effects,  reviewable under  intermediate  scrutiny. See  Humanitarian  Law Project, 561 U.S.  at 26. The  Court  disagreed,  concluding  that the statute  was  a content-based  regulation  of speech. Id. at 27. Given the government's  argument, however,  Congress  may not have realized  that the  statute could be applied as  a content-based  regulation  of  speech.  It is  therefore  uncertain whether  its provisions  were  intended  to  apply  to  these  activities. Cf Weinrib, Supreme Court of Canada  in the Age of  Rights, supra note 138, at 740 (arguing that Canadian  law's requirement  that a challenged  act be authorized  or "prescribed  by law"  in a statute or regulation  ensures that democratic deliberation  has been brought to bear on laws limiting the  exercise of  rights).

their  nonviolent  education  and  training  activities,  the  Court further  accepted Congress's finding that  "any contribution" to a  terrorist organization  facilitates its  terrorist  conduct-a  finding  the  Court  found  was  "justified"  in  an  area where concrete information was often unavailable  but serious risks were  real."' This  deference  to  the  government  raises  echoes  of Dennis and  casts  further doubt  on  the constraining character of  the "categorical" approach  to free speech.

There  is  much to debate  about  the Court's analysis  in Humanitarian  Law; I focus  here  only  on  two  methodological  points  relating  to  structured  proportionality analysis.

First,  it is  possible  to  understand  the  Court  as  saying  that  the  statute  was sufficiently  narrowly  tailored  to  the government's compelling  interest in  combatting  terrorism.21 6 It is  not clear,  however,  how seriously  the  Court  took the idea of  narrow  tailoring  (which is  analogous  to  the minimal impairment  step); it did not,  for  example,  explain  how  the  "contribution"  of training  in international  law  could be  "fungible"  with support  for  terrorist activities,  in  the  way other  forms  of contribution  (such  as  money)  could  be.  It  arguably  applied  a less  stringent  means-ends  test of  whether  the prohibition  could  be  said rationally to  serve  the government's asserted  interests  at all."'  What  the  Court  may really  have  been  conveying  was  the overriding  importance  of the  government interest  relative  to  the  free  speech  interests  affected  by  the  specific  statutory prohibition.  Had  the Court followed  a  more  structured  analysis"' it would be

215. Humanitarian  Law Project, 561 U.S.  at 28-30. But  cf  supra note 214 (questioning whether Congress  intended such a reading of the statute).

216. Id. at 26 ("[T]he statute  is  carefully  drawn  to cover  only  a narrow category  of speech to, under the direction  of, or in coordination with foreign  groups that the speaker  knows to be terrorist organizations.").

217. See  id. at 28-32 (explaining  various  reasons  why  Congress  was  "justified"  in  thinking  that cutting  off all  material  support  would  help weaken  or delegitimize  terrorist  groups); id. at 33-35 (explaining  why the Court accepted the Executive  Department's affidavits that it is not "possible  in  practice  to  distinguish  material  support  for  a  foreign  terrorist  group's violent activities and  its  nonviolent activities,"  without  requiring  the  government  to  show  that speech  to provide training  in international  law has  the same  potential  for supporting violent activities  as  other  forms  of material  support  aimed  at nonviolent  activity,  for  example,  contribution of  funds for food).
218. Under Oakes, even  if a  restriction  on expression  is rationally  related  to  a  pressing  and important  government  interest,  and  even  if the  restriction  minimally  impairs  the  plaintiffs speech  rights, the courts  must,  in order  to  sustain it, find that the statute  is  proportionate  as such -meaning that the objective advanced  was more significant than  the harm  to the plaintiffs expressive  rights.  Under  U.S.  "strict  scrutiny,"  a statute  that passed  the  first  two  queries  would be  upheld,  regardless  of  whether  the harm  to rights  were  greater or  less  than the benefit  towards  compelling  interests. Humanitarian  Law Project might  be  understood  as relaxing  the  narrow  tailoring/least  restrictive  alternative  test in light  of its  implicit evaluation of "proportionality as  such"  in matters  involving  terrorism. See infra note 223. Alternatively,

easier  to understand  whether  the  Court  was  modifying  (or  abandoning)  narrow tailoring  as  a requirement  in some class  of national security  cases.  Second, addressing  all  of these  elements  might  not  only  clarify  the  doctrine  but  also better protect  free speech,  which is  always  under particular  stress during  times of war or perceived security  threats.  Governments  that will be held  accountable for  failures  of security  may  in  good  faith  believe  that  broad  prohibitions  on "support"  are  needed  to  provide  the  greatest  assurance  against  future  terrorism,  without necessarily  considering  whether  any marginal gain  in  security  by prohibiting  peaceful  speech,  in the  form  of teaching  foreign  groups  about  international  law, justifies  the  harm to  free  speech  values.  "Least restrictive  alternative"  analysis might be understood to accept the government's goals  (assuming  they  are  "compelling")  without  evaluating  their  relative force  vis-a-vis intrusion  on rights.  The added  question  of "proportionality  as  such"  enables  a court,  even as  it defers  to  government expertise  on  the  nature of security risks, to  exercise  independent  judgment  on  whether  the  risk  reductions  justify  the harm  to  free  speech  rights."  Because  U.S.  courts  do  not use  structured  proportionality  doctrine  in their  constitutional  jurisprudence,  they  may  not even consider  the appropriate  relationship  of  government  goals to free  speech rights, captured  by  "proportionality  as  such,"  or  may  do  so sub silentio, to  the  detriment of both rights protection  and the transparent  and consistent development of constitutional law.

Consider, again, United States v. Alvarez," the Stolen Valor Act case.  A separate  evaluation  of the  "less  restrictive  means"  and  "proportionality  as  such" tests  might have  clarified  the  decision.  Although  both the  plurality  and Justice Breyer  asserted that the  criminal  statute  could  not be upheld  because  the  government's interest  in  protecting  the  integrity  of military  medals  could  be  advanced  by  other  means, the  plurality  opinion, at  least,  was  unclear  about

Humanitarian  Law Project might be understood as  accepting  that there  was no other way to advance  the government's  interests  in  preventing  terrorist  groups  from  gaining legitimacy or persuading  allies  of the seriousness  of U.S.  anti-terrorism  commitments.  But under  the Oakes test,  even  if there  were  no  less  restrictive  and  equally  effective  alternative  to  these ends,  courts would in theory  still  ask whether  the relative advancement  of the government's goals  would justify so severe a limitation on  speech and associational  activities.

219. Cf BARAK, supra note 22, at 414 (arguing  that while  the  government has  expertise  and competence  on  security  risks,  the  court  has  expertise  in  the  protection  of rights); see also HCJ 2056/04 Beit Sourik Vill. Council  v.  Gov't  of  Israel,  58(5) PD 807, 845 [2004] (Isr.), translated  in 2004 IsR. L.

whether other mechanisms were  or needed to be viewed  as  equally  effective.' Arguably,  both  the  plurality  opinion  and Justice  Breyer's combined  the  "less restrictive  means" test  with a  sub  silentio evaluation  of  "proportionality as such." m Important as  the integrity of military honors  may be,  it may not have warranted  an ex ante  effort to suppress even false speech through a broad  criminal  sanction,  if the  goal  of protecting  military  honors  could  have been  served through  less  restrictive  measures -even if those  alternative  measures  were  not quite as  effective  as  a criminal sanction in deterring  false claims. If this captures what the Justices  in the majority  were thinking,  then  "proportionality  as  such" might  have  better  explained  what  motivated  the  decision."  Even  if the  outcome  were  not  changed  through  the adoption  of a  structured  proportionality approach,  the Justices' reasoning would have been clarified.

221. Id. at 2551 (plurality opinion)  (stating  that when the Government  seeks  to regulate  protected speech, the restriction  must be the "least  restrictive  means  among available,  effective alternatives,"  but not  indicating whether the other  means  must be equally effective)  (citation  omitted); see also id. at 2555 (Breyer,  J.,  concurring  in  the judgment)  (asking  "whether  it is  possible  substantially to achieve the  Government's objective  in less burdensome ways").
222. Justice  Breyer's opinion  is  explicit  in applying  an  "intermediate"  form  of scrutiny,  because government prohibitions  on  intentional  lies  are  not  as  harmful  as  other  kinds  of contentbased  distinctions. Id. at 2551-52. He concludes  that "the  statute risks harming  protected  interests but only in  order to achieve  a substantial  countervailing  objective,"  and thus turns  to the  question whether  less  burdensome  means  are  available,  and concludes  that the  government had not met its burden of showing that such alternatives  were  not available.  Whether his  standard  of "substantially"  achieving  the  government's objective  is  intended  to  convey that  the  alternative  is  "equally"  effective  remains  unclear. See  id. at 2556 (stating  that  "it is likely  that  [alternatives]  will  effectively  serve  Congress'  end").  Justice  Breyer's  opinion  can perhaps  be  best  understood  through  the  lens  of the  burden  of persuasion, a  burden  he found the  government  did not meet.
223. Cf Alberta  v.  Hutterian  Brethren  of Wilson  Colony, [2009] 2 S.C.R.  567,  5 149 (Can.) (Abella, J.,  dissenting)  ("It  is  possible ... to  have a law,  which  is  not  minimally  impairing but may,  on balance,  given  the  importance of the  government  objective,  be  proportional."). Justice  Abella's comment,  which  I  do not read  to  suggest a  departure  from Canada's  structured  sequence  of  questions,  is  intriguing.  Although  under  conventional  applications  of structured  proportionality  doctrine use of a means  that is  broader than  necessary would end analysis,  to invalidate  a statute  on  this ground,  where  the statute  is  otherwise  proportional, might even  be  considered  excessive  in  light  of the problems  of legislative  inertia.  That  is, even if a legislature  would favor enactment of a more narrowly drawn law to replace  one too broadly drawn, this may not occur -especially in a separated  powers system -because  other matters  crowd  the legislative  agenda,  or  because  of conflicts  between  legislature  and  government.  A more  relaxed approach  to "minimal  impairment" where  the  intrusion  on rights is  relatively small  and the  benefit  to a very  important government  goal  is  significant  might be,  in a  sense,  more proportionate  than invalidating  the law,  once the risks of legislative  inertia  are considered.

## C. Theoretical  Benefits of  Proportionality Review in Deciding  Rights Claims

This Part will  now identify at a more general  level several benefits  to be derived from judges  applying proportionality doctrine  or principles  in evaluating rights  claims.  First,  experience  elsewhere  suggests  that structured  proportionality  review  provides  a  stable  framework  for persuasive  reason-giving,  thereby enhancing  the transparency  of decisions,  unlike more  opaque  forms  of balancing.'  Second,  proportionality  analysis  helps  to  bridge  the  roles  of courts  and legislatures.  It  requires  legal  authorization  for  infringement  of rights;  it also identifies  criteria-to  which  legislatures  are  competent  to  speak-that  form part  of the justificatory  process.  Third,  reliance  on  proportionality  principles can help bring law closer  to  the community's sense  of  justice,  in part  by cultivating the  art of  judgment by judges  and lawyers.  Fourth,  attention to proportionality can help identify,  and respond  to, process deficiencies  in governance.

## 1. Structured  and Transparent  Reason-Giving  with Broad  Justificatory Appeal

Proportionality  analysis  in  Canada  and  some  other jurisdictions  provides  a structured  and transparent  mode of reason-giving  that produces  justifications likely  to be  meaningful,  or at least understandable,  to the parties  and other  audiences  for constitutional  courts' decisions.  The  sequencing  and  defined order of proportionality  review  of  constitutional  rights  claims  in Canada has provided  a  more  or  less  stable  doctrinal  framework  within  which  disagreements  are conducted.'  It also contributes  to the relative  accessibility  and  transparency of the Court's reasoning.  The stability  of the  methodology,  and its widespread acceptance,  enables the Canadian justices' disagreements  to focus on matters that are understandable  by the parties  as  substantively  relevant  to  the  contested  issue;  such  opinions  also  make  accessible  to  readers  the  nature  of the  justices' disagreement,  and  the  divergent  evaluations  they  may  give  to  the  same  factors.2 6 The  sequencing  of analysis  may  be contrasted  with  more  "free  form"

224. See Aleinikoff, supra note 15, at 976  (discussing the  "black box"  of  balancing).

225. See, e.g., Vicki  C.  Jackson, Being Proportional  About Proportionality, 21 CONST.  COMMENT. 803,  830-32 (2004) (book review);  Stone  Sweet &amp; Mathews, supra note 37,  at 90 ("[Proportionality  analysis]  clearly  indicates  to litigating parties  the  type  and sequence  of arguments that can  and must be made,  and the path  through which the judges will  reason to  their decision.").

226. See Jackson, supra note 225, at 831;  Stone  Sweet  &amp; Mathews, supra note  37,  at  96-97.  This structured analysis  may also have  the beneficial effect of  encouraging  judges to articulate  the actual  reasons for their opinions. See Frank M.  Coffin, Judicial  Balancing: The Protean  Scales ofJustice, 63  N.Y.U.  L. REv.  16, 22-23 (1988)  (emphasizing the  importance  of "real  reasons" that  "reflect  the  thought processes  of the writer and of those  colleagues  joining in the opin-

evaluations  in well-known  U.S.  balancing cases. 7 In  the  United  States,  however,  different  Justices  may  well  continue  to  deploy  different  methodologies, and so  some of the structured  transparency  and consistency  gains  of a Canadian-style approach  might not be realized.

In  addition  to  its  benefits  in structuring  and  making more  transparent  the reasoning  of  the  different  justices,  proportionality  review-by  embracing  a wider  range  of reasons  than  those  that  resort  to  text,  precedent,  and  history alone -may increase  the persuasive  value  of the  decisions  to both the parties,8 and the broader public. As Cass  Sunstein has written, "[i]n  American constitutional  law,  government  must  always  have  a reason  for what  it does."u 9 Frank Michelman's  work  emphasizes  the  connection  between  government  reasongiving and equality  of  persons."' Authority to act is  not the same as  a reason to act;  authority  alone  does  not  meet demands  for reasons.  Furthermore, varying ion"). More  speculatively,  the sequence  of questions  in structured proportionality  may have a  "de-biasing"  effect:  judges  whose  instinct  is that  a challenged  law  is  unconstitutional  still have  to  address  its  "suitability" -that is,  whether it advances  the  government's  objective  at all,  a question  that will  typically  be answered  in the affirmative. Judges whose instinct  is that a  regulation  is justified  even  if it infringes  on an  area of rights have  to pause  to  consider,  at the minimal  impairment  step,  whether there  are  less intrusive  means that serve  government goals equally  well. By  unpacking  the analytical  elements more  than U.S.  strict  scrutiny,  this approach  in theory  yields more complete  consideration  of  competing  points of  view.

227. See,  e.g., Mathews  v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319  (1976); Dennis v.  United  States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951); see also Coffin, supra note 226, at 29-30 (criticizing  cases  in which  there  is  no  "illuminating responsive discussion"  in the majority  and dissenting opinions).
228.  On the  role of  judicial judgments  in persuading losers that  their loss  was legitimate,  see,  for example, Flannery  v.  Halifax  Estate Agencies Ltd., [1999]  1 W.L.R.  377  (Eng.)  (linking  "duty to give  reasons"  to "fairness ... to the  parties -especially the losing  party," who  "should be left  in no  doubt why they have won or  lost"); R.  v.  Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26,  [2002]  1 S.C.R. 869, 5 60  (Can.)  (explaining  that "where hard choices  have to be made,  [reasons]  may provide  a  modicum of comfort,  especially  to  the  losing  party,  that the  process  operated  fairly" (citation  omitted)); cf Vlad Perju, Proportionality  and Freedom-An Essay on Method in Constitutional Law, 1 GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM 334 (2012) (arguing  that the multiple,  careful steps  of proportionality  analysis  help promote  a  sense  of procedural  justice  in  losers,  who can  see that  their  arguments  were  taken  seriously).  Indeed, it might  even be  argued,  caseby-case  proportionality  analysis  offers  hope  to  "losers" that,  in  a  different  context,  their claim might "win."

reasons  may  appeal  to  different  audiences. 23 '  Even  in  the formulation  of categorical  rules,  as  in Atwater, the  Court  typically  invokes  at  least  some  consequentialist  understanding-there, of  the  need  to  allow  unimpeded  law  enforcement. Notwithstanding the sometimes-expressed view that proportionality  involves  only  arbitrary  evaluations, 23 2 there  is  nothing  "nonlegal"  about  efforts  to  promote  the  proportionality  of government  action  by considering its  effects on relevant constitutional  values. 33

## 2. Bridge  Between Courts  and Legislatures

A second benefit  of structured proportionality  analysis  is that it can provide a bridge between decision  making in courts and decision making by the people, legislatures,  and public  officials. Proportionality doctrine  arguably  invites  more participatory  deliberation  over  constitutional  rights,  and  it  may  achieve  more compliance  by  legislatures  and  other officers  with  constitutional  values  by offering  a  rubric  for  decision  making  that  is  accessible  to  those  other  decision makers. 234

Preliminary  inquiries  into  whether  challenged  action  has  been  authorized by  law and  has  a proper  purpose  can  be  seen  not simply as  judicial checks  on government action but as opportunities  for the legislature  to  reflect on and improve  its  own  legislative  product.  Insisting  on  proper  purpose  and  legal  authority  focuses  attention  on  the central  role  of legislatures  in authorizing,  and

231. Cf. Michelman, supra note 230, at 30-34 (describing certain  balancing  tests as  a commitment to "a communicative  practice of open and intelligble reason-giving").

233. See also  infra notes 251-258 and  accompanying  text (discussing  "constitutional judgment"). As  leading constitutional  scholars  recognize,  legitimate  sources  in constitutional law include multiple  forms  of argumentation-including  "ethos"  and "prudential"  forms  of argument, concerned  with  values  and  consequences. See PHILLIP BOBBITT,  CONSTITUTIONAL  FATETHEORY OF THE CONSTITUTION  (1982);  PHILLIP BOBBITT,  CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION (1991) (describing  and  exploring  several  forms  of interpreting  the  Constitution); see  also Robert Post, Theories of  Constitutional  Interpretation,  in LAW AND  THE  ORDER OF CULTURE  1341 (Robert  Post  ed., 1991) (describing  doctrinal,  historical,  and  responsive  interpretation); Richard  H.  Fallon,  Jr., A  Constructivist Coherence Theory of Constitutional  Interpretation, 100 HARV. L.  REv. 1189 (1987) (describing  how  different  modes of interpretation  work together).

Heller,  554  U.S. 570,  628  n.27  (2008) ("'[R]ational basis' is not just the standard of scrutiny, but  the  very  substance of the  constitutional  guarantee."); H. Jefferson Powell, Reasoning  About the Irrational:  The Roberts Court  and the Future  of Constitutional  Law, 86 WASH. L. REv. 217  (2011) (criticizing  the  Court's equating "rational  basis" as a standard  of review with the  substance of the  constitutional guarantee).

limiting,  government  conduct  that  affects  rights. 35 Assuming  authority  and proper  purpose,  legislative  decision  making  may  also  take  into  account  and thereby  influence  courts' determinations  of whether  the proportionate  means tests have  been  met. Proportionality doctrine  can  thus be seen  as a reflection of the  dual  commitments  of  constitutional  democracies-to the  protection  of rights  and  to democratic  self-governance,  which  itself can be conceived  of as  a right.23 6

Moreover,  in  situations  of epistemic  or  normative  uncertainty,  legislatures may be  more  empirically  competent  and democratically  legitimate  than courts in  making  prognostic  factual  determinations  and  in  making  accommodations among  competing  values. 2 37 As  Robert  Alexy  put  it,  when  judgments  about "suitability" (rationality) or  "necessity" (analogous  to  minimal  impairment) are  in a  zone  of "epistemic  uncertainty,"  the fact  that  the  legislature  is  democratically elected is  a reason to  accept  its determination of these issues.3' When there  is  epistemic  uncertainty-for  example,  whether  decriminalizing  marijuana  would  be  as  effective  as  criminalization  in  preventing  dangers  associated with  that drug's trade  and use-legislative judgments about the necessity of  the criminal prohibition prevail. 39 When  there  is a  "normative" stalemate-

235. See  also Weinrib, Constitutional Comparativism, supra note  138,  at 17 (arguing  that  the  requirement that limitations  be "prescribed  by law"  means  that encroachment on  rights  must be "authorized  ... through the  regular channels  of law-making,  so that it is the product of a representative, accountable, deliberative public process" while  acknowledging that the "principled elaboration  of the common law  also satisfies"  the formal standard); cf Stephen Gardbaum, Proportionality  and Democratic Constitutionalism, in PROPORTIONALITY AND THE RULE  OF LAW:  RIGHTS,  JUSTIFICATION,  REASONING 259, 260-61  (Grant  Huscroft  et  al.  eds., 2014) (advancing  a  "broadly-gauged  conception  and  defense  of a  proportionality-like  test for limiting rights"  that  "seeks  to accommodate  and temper enduring  and legitimate  democratic  concerns.").  For  an argument  that  legislatures  constitute  rights  by  deciding on  their limitations, see GREGOIRE  C. N. WEBBER,  THE NEGOTIABLE  CONSTITUTION (2012).

236. Stephen Gardbaum  has  argued  that proportionality  review  can  be  understood  to  enhance, rather  than  to  constrain,  democracy. See generally Gardbaum, supra note  235.  Gardbaum's suggestion  is  that  proportionality  review  is democracy  enhancing  insofar  as  it is  understood to allow democratic  legislatures  to  limit  rights.  My  argument is  slightly different:  that  proportionality  review may  be democracy  enhancing  and rights  enhancing  at once,  insofar  as  it engages legislatures  in understanding  and protecting  rights in the legislative process.
237. Some  courts  have,  for  example,  indicated  that legislatures  have  considerable  discretion  on the  rationality  of means,  contemplating  judicial non-accceptance  of the  legislature's presumed  finding  of rationality  only  rarely,  as  in  cases  of corruption. See,  e.g., BARAK, supra note 22, at 311 (discussing the Gaza  Coast Regional council  case); see also id. at 312 ("[T]he legislator's  discretion in  determining  its  legislative  prognosis  is wide.")  For Barak,  legislators  make  choices  within  a  "zone  of proportionality,"  while  courts police  that  legislative choices remain within that zone. Id. at 397-411.

239. Id. at 399-400. But cf R. v.  Oakes,  [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, 136-37  (placing  the "onus"  of  justification on the party seeking to  uphold the limitation).

involving,  for example,  competing  principles worthy  of optimization  as  in the protection  of workers'  rights  and  those  of small  employers  in  lay-off  situations -legislatures have  normative discretion  to make different  choices."  And, in  theory,  the  sequenced  structure  of proportionality  doctrine  allows  for judicial  deference  to  legislative  resolution  of some  questions,  such  as  minimal  impairment,  even if not on all questions.

One  of  Laurence Tribe's  critiques of  John  Hart  Ely's  representationreinforcement  theory  of  judicial  review  was  that Ely's theory  offered  no  guidance  on  constitutional  meaning  to  legislators  or  executive  branch  actors.' By contrast,  the  questions  of proportionality  analysis  resonate  with  the  competences  of  legislatures,  especially  in its inquiries  about rational  relation  and minimal  impairment,  both  of which  have  "predictive"  factual  components  about the  connection  between  the  means  chosen  and  the  legislative  goal.14 Legislators  who  understand  that  statutes will  be  evaluated  under  proportionality standards  if challenged  as  infringing  on  individual  constitutional  rights  will have  reason  to  give  attention  to  the  rationality  of the means,  to whether  there are  other  means less  likely  to  intrude  on  rights,  and to whether  the gains  to  be achieved  are  weightier and  of such  a character  as to warrant intrusions  on protected  freedoms."  As  Mattias  Kumm  has  written,  focusing  public  actors  on the elements of  proportionality  review  can have a disciplining effect  on public  authorities  and help[]  foster  an attitude  of civilian  confidence  among  citizens.  The legal  institutionalization  of Socratic  contestation  helps  keep alive  the idea  that  acts  by public  authorities  that  impose burdens  on individuals must be understandable  as rea-

243. In a rights-valuing legal  culture,  legislators  may have political  incentives  to be careful  of  protecting  rights,  particularly  on legislation  that  is of high  public salience.  For  related  discussion,  see JEREMY WALDRON,  THE DIGNITY  OF LEGISLATION 86  (1999) (discussing the legislator's role  as  "judging"  what  is just, or  in  accord with  society's conception  of natural law); WEBBER, supra note 235, at 149-59 (arguing that "[f)or  a legislator,  the ground for a political decision  should  always  be  its  justification  in a  free  and democratic  society"  and  that legislators must be  guided  by standards  of  public reason).

sonable  collective  judgments  about  what  justice  and  good  policy  requires to  be legitimate."

Proportionality  considered  in courts  and  in legislatures  may differ:  legislatures can  focus  on  finding  the  best  achievable  solutions;  "proportionality  analysis" by courts can  serve  as  a check against serious  disproportionalities. 5 For courts, the sequenced structure of proportionality doctrine  offers benefits  of  consistency and transparency  in methodology;  but for both legislatures  and courts,  there are benefits from considering proportionality,  even in less  structured ways,  as a principle of  justice.

## 3. Justice,  Law, and  Judgment

Proportionality  as  principle  or  doctrine  is  a  way to  bring  the  demands  of justice  into  greater  harmony with  the law  of constitutional  rights.4 6 Justice  is not synonymous  with law;  it provides  a critical  platform  from which  to  evaluate  law.  There  is  value  in a  legal  system's aspiring  to do justice,  as  understood in its  society.  Attention to different  factual  contexts,  as well  as  the need to confront the impact of  general  rules on particular  cases  in terms of  proportionality, can help hone a juridical  and political community's sense of  justice.2 7

Legal  systems  whose  decisions  do  not  resonate  with  widely  held  conceptions of justice  may not be  able  over  the long run  to perform  their basic  functions.  Such  decisions  undermine  respect  for  law  and  for  the  legitimacy  of courts.  In  the  context  of Fourth Amendment  law,  scholars  have  observed  that

245. See SULIVAN &amp; FRASE, supra note 52, at  8  (suggesting that  the "balancing"  metaphor implies an  optimum point,  whereas proportionality  review  focuses  on whether  action  is  disproportionate,  recognizing  legislatures  and  executive  officials  as  the  "primary  decisionmakers"). But cf Julian  Rivers, Proportionality  and Variable Intensity of  Review,  65 CAMBRIDGE L.J. 174, 195-206  (2006) (distinguishing  "optimizing"  from  "state-limiting"  uses  of proportionality and  arguing  that  "optimizing"  facilitates  "orderly"  approaches  to  deference,  which  either approach  entails).
246. For  a defense  of proportionality  review's ability  to  bring  constitutional  rights  in  line  with justice,  see Mattias  Kumm, Constitutional  Rights as Principles:  On the Structure and  Domain  of Constitutional Justice, 2 INT'L J.  CONST. L.  574 (2004) (reviewing  ROBERT ALExY,  A THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS (Julian Rivers  trans., 2002)). On  the relationship  of rights  to justice, see also Webber, supra note 136, at 126-29.
247. Kumm, supra note 244, at 147 (proportionality  review  is  "the means  by which values  are  related  to  possibilities  of the normative  and  factual world").  One  of the  intended  benefits  of the  independent  Article  III  courts  was  to  "mitigate[e]" and  "moderate"  legislation  that  is "unjust"  or  "partial." See THE FEDERALIST No. 78 (Alexander  Hamilton)  (arguing that independent  courts  would  serve  these  functions  both  in  applying  laws  that are  enacted  and  in providing a check on future  inequitable legislation).

the Court has tended to reject categorical  rules  and apply totality of the circumstances  tests  where  the  proposed  categorical  rule  would benefit  those who  are the subjects  of police  searches,  and to embrace  categorical  rules where  they are permissive  of police  behavior.24 8 This  pattern,  together with  the  exclusion  of officers' intent (or pretext)  and of state  or local  law  in defining what is  reasonable, 4 9 cannot  but tend  to  contribute  to  the lack  of trust in police  now prevalent in  many minority communities.  In this area,  moving towards  doctrine that permits  a  fuller  range  of the  factors  that  people  in  ordinary  life  consider  reasonable  would  help  re-establish  the  law's connection  to justice.  To  be  sure, constitutional justice will  often  be contested.  Even  so, proportionality doctrine helps  clarify  the  grounds  for  decision  and  the  relative  importance  of different components of justice,  thereby  providing a framework  of analysis  for resolving what is  most importantly at stake. 5

248. See Albert W. Alschuler, Bright  Line Fever and the Fourth  Amendment, 45 U. PIrr. L.  REV. 227, 242 (1984) ("[M]ost  of the  Supreme  Court's current  bright  line  rules  tell  police  officers, 'Yes, you  may search,' rather  than 'No,  you may  not."'); David A.  Sklansky, Traffic Stops, Minority Motorists, and the Future of the Fourth  Amendment, 1997 SUP.  CT.  REV. 271, 295-98, 308  (contrasting  the Court's rejection of a  bright-line  "first-tell-then-ask"  rule,  designed  to moderate police  pressure  on suspects  to consent to  searches,  with "a pronounced  pattern  of ruling in favor of  the  government"  in Fourth Amendment  cases).
249. See,  e.g., Virginia v.  Moore,  553  U.S.  164,  168-73 (2008) (treating police  officers' violation  of a  state  law authorizing  only  a citation,  and not an arrest,  as  irrelevant  to petitioner's Fourth Amendment challenge  to  the reasonableness  of a search  incident to that arrest,  and concluding more  generally  that  the  Fourth Amendment  was  not  understood  to  include  constraints of subsequently  enacted  statutes); Whren v.  United  States, 517 U.S. 8o6,  815-16  (1996)  (rejecting the  argument that "insistence  upon police adherence  to standard practices  [is]  an objective  means  of rooting out pretext"  and  seemingly  treating  as  irrelevant  whether officers complied with local practices  (there, embodied in a regulation)  that vary from place  to  place, because  Fourth Amendment  law cannot "be made to turn upon such  trivialities").
250. See Jackson, supra note  79,  at 613-19. Because  justice,  and  the  relative  weight  of different constitutional  values  is  contestable,  application  of proportionality  analysis  will  sometimes yield  different conclusions  even  in the  same  system,  in ways  that  structured  proportionality analysis  can  help  make  more  transparent. See  infra notes 449-451 and  accompanying  text (discussing  the majority and dissenting  opinions  in  the  Canadian Keegstra case  concerning hate  speech). Compare Roe  v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113  (1973) (applying  "strict scrutiny"  to establish a trimester  approach to  abortion regulation), with Planned Parenthood of Se.  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833 (1992) (rejecting  the  trimester  approach  and establishing  an  "undue burden" test for  the  constitutionality of  regulations designed  to protect  fetal life  before viability).  Looking  transnationally  at  abortion  regulation,  a  range  of approaches  arguably meets  the  requirements  of proportionality in  different national  settings.  Where  a  court comes  down depends  in  important part  on the substantive  constitutional  values  of its jurisdiction,  including  whether  the jurisdiction  recognizes  a  fetal  right  to  life  protected  by  the constitution,  as  neither  Canada, see R.  v.  Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30 (Can.), nor the United  States  does.  But  in any  system  respecting  women's  equality,  application  of proportionality  analysis will impose constraints  on whether and how  aggressively abortions  can  be prohibited. See generally VIcKI  C. JACKSON &amp; MARK  TUSHNET,  COMPARATIVE  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW  1-158, 210,  219-21 (3d  ed. 2014) (describing decisions  in United  States,  Germa-

A related  advantage  of proportionality  is  the  opportunities  it  provides  for the  development  of what  we  might  call  constitutional  judgment  or  "situation sense." 2 " Mark  Tushnet  has  argued  that  Justice Breyer's  dissent  in Heller should  not  be  understood  as  primarily  about  proportionality or  balancing, notwithstanding its  use of "proportionality"  language;  rather,  it  should be understood  as  about  the  application  of legal  judgment  to  complex  settings. 52 Tushnet  has  also argued  that the  Court's First Amendment  decisions  in  such cases  as Snyder v.  Phelps, 5 3 United States v.  Stevens," and Sorrell v.  IMS Health Inc., 2 " represent  a  form  of "judicial  pathology,"  consisting  of overestimating the  harms  that prohibitions  on speech  would cause  and an insensitivity  to the distribution  of those  harms.25 6 This pathology, Tushnet  suggests, is  connected to the  "rule-ification"  of the  area  and  a related  "fear"  of making  obvious judgment calls  on issues of degree. 2 57 Once a "rule"  is announced,  its  function  is  to focus judicial  attention only  on the "rule"  (that  is, for example,  asking whether a regulation  is  "content-based"), rather  than on  the  purposes  of the  constitutional  provision  the  rule  is  intended  to  implement.  The  arguments  for  "ruleification" are  stronger  with  respect  to  multiple  decision  makers,  like  lower court judges  and executive  officials,  than with  respect  to  the  Supreme  Court, which can  always consider  introducing  an  "exception"  to  a rule.  In  recent  free speech cases,  however,  the Court has  arguably deprived itself of the opportunity  to  engage  with  the purposes  behind  the  presumptive  rule  against  content-

ny,  Canada,  Colombia, and the European  Court of Human Rights,  and noting that permissible  restrictions under European case law  may  depend  in part  on  the  available  social  resources  for medical  and  other services, as well  as  the  ease  of travel). Proportionality's  emphasis  on a clear understanding  of what  rights  are  at  stake  and on  the justification for  rerestrictions enables  both  proponents  and  opponents  of abortion regulation to  make  their claims to legislatures in understandable  terms  and allows  courts to consider  arguments challenging legislation  in terms that connect both to constitutional values  and lived experiences.

The Court in Stevens, for example,  rejected the government's argument for a  '"categorical balancing  of the  value  of the  speech  against  its  societal  cost,'" denying  that the Court has  "a freewheeling  authority to declare  new  categories of speech  outside the scope  of the First Amendment." 2 5 9 Consider instead if the question  had been  whether the statute met a multi-part proportionality standard like  that used  in Canada.  Presumably  the  Court would  have  found  that it did not,  because  the  statute was  so  "overbroad" it would  have  failed  "minimal impairment." But  the Court would  also  have  had to  address  such  questions  as whether  the  government's purpose  in  reducing animal  cruelty  was  legitimate and of sufficient  importance  to warrant some  limitation of expressive activity, and whether prohibiting the commercial  development  and distribution of videos  featuring animal cruelty was  a rational means  of achieving  that purpose.26o The guidance  provided  by analysis  of these  questions  might have assisted subsequent  legislative  efforts  to  address  the  problem  through more  narrowly tailored  legislation.2 6 1  Proportionality analysis,  in short, could  help  promote judi-

Concluding  that the  law  did not fall within  the "historic and traditional  categories"  of permissible  speech  restrictions, see id. at 468  (citation omitted),  and after rejecting  the government's argument for a blunt balancing test to identify  new  areas  of permissible  regulation,  the Court applied  its  "existing doctrine," id. at 472, and found the statute unconstitutional for  overbreadth. It went  immediately to overbreadth analysis  without  considering,  for  example, the  statute's purposes,  or the  rationality of  its means. See  infra note 260.

## 4. Process  Failures  Warranting  Heightened Scrutiny

A different  kind  of argument  arises  from considering  whether  disproportionalities  in the effects  of government  action may  be a signal  of failures  in  the legislative  process  that  warrant  increased  scrutiny  by  the  courts. 6 '  On  John Hart Ely's theory,  process  failures  resulting  from  conscious  prejudice  and  intentional  discrimination  against minority groups  warrant higher levels of  justification and judicial  scrutiny. 6 A wider  range of process failures  might be signaled  by  disproportionalities  in  the  application  of law.  Disproportionalities such as  those  that occur when  a law is  more  intrusive  than necessary  to  serve the  stated purposes-may  signal  an  underlying  problem,  relating  not only  to conscious  prejudice  but also  to  failures  of equal  regard.  Some  may  arise  from lawmakers' insufficient  concern  with  disproportionate  effects  on  the  relatively powerless; some  may  reflect  unconscious or  unarticulated  prejudices;  some may arise  from  the  simple  inability  to  anticipate  legislation's  effects.  Each  of these  might  be  understood  as  a process  failure:  a  failure,  in Justice  John  Paul Stevens's  terms,  to  fulfill  the  government's  duty  of  impartiality  to  the  peo-

of hunting and  the  slaughter of animals  for  food. See Pub.  L.  No. 111-294, S  3(a), 124 Star. 3178  (2010). The  reference  to "obscenity"  was  an  evident  effort  to  come  within  an  established  "categorical"  exception  for obscenity. See Miller  v.  California, 413 U.S. 15  (1973). At least one  constitutional challenge  to the new  statute, accepted  by  the  District Court,  was  rejected by  the  Fifth  Circuit.  See  United  States  v.  Richards, 940 F.  Supp.  2d 548 (S.D.  Tex. 2013), rev'd, 755 F.3d 269 (5th  Cir. 2014), cert.  denied, 83  U.S.L.W. 3742,  2015 WL 1280267 (Mar. 23  2015).

262. See Jackson, supra note 225, at 830 n.82 ("[Proportionality]  can be  used to  help screen legislation for purposes  that are  deemed  impermissible on other  grounds.").

263. See ELY, supra note 122, at 102-04. For critique  of  political  process  theory  as the basis  for judicial  review  as  "radically  indeterminate  and fundamentally  incomplete,"  see Tribe, supra note 241,  at 1064. Such  objections do not,  in my view,  apply to  considering  the disproportionate effects  of laws  as  a  signal  of the kind of possible  process  failure  that  may  conflict with  more substantive  constitutional  commitments.

ple.2 6 4  Some  such process  failures  may warrant heightened judicial attention or intervention.2 6 S

In  the  United  States,  the  tiered  structure  of  review  applicable to  rights claims  under  equal  protection  and  due  process  already  embodies  to a  certain extent  the  idea of proportionality,  because  more  is  required  to justify  laws  in categories  deemed  likely  to  be  of greater  constitutional  concern;  so,  too,  does the role of less intrusive  alternatives  in areas of U.S.  doctrine.2 6 6 There can be  a large  gap  between  "strict  scrutiny"  and  "rational  basis"  review,  however,  seen in the contrasting  treatment of overt  racial classifications  and neutral laws with a disparate  impact based  on  race.  The principle of proportionality supports Justice Thurgood Marshall's suggestion that whether a classification  violates equal protection  should depend  not  on  rigid ex  ante  categories  but on  a  more  flexible,  more proportionate  approach,2 6 7  as  will be  discussed  further  in  Part V below.

264. Justice  Stevens  has  articulated  a "duty  to  govern  impartially"  in  several  opinions. See,  e.g., Vieth v.  Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267,  341  (2004) (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting);  Harris  v.  McRae,  448 U.S. 297, 357 (1980) (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting); see also Jeremy Waldron, Principles  of  Legislation,  in THE LEAST  EXAMINED  BRANCH, supra note 30, at 21 (discussing  the  importance  of impartiality and justice  in legislation).

265. As  discussed  further  in  Part V, disproportionate applications  are  a necessary  feature  of prophylactic  rules; but if there is  a good  enough reason  for  having such a rule,  some disproportionalities  must be accepted  or its prophylactic  goals  would be undermined.  Interests  arguably  within the  scope of rights  may  be underprotected by  prophylactic  rules  designed,  for example,  to  prevent  mistaken judicial  interference  with legislation  in  arenas  in which  past judicial  interventions were  regarded as  erroneous  intrusions  on democratic  decision  making based  on  a mistaken  understanding of rights. See United States  v.  Carolene  Prods.  Co., 304 U.S.  144, 152 (1938)  (signaling  that the Court  would henceforth  uphold  "regulatory legislation  affecting ordinary commercial  transactions"  unless the  facts  are such "as to preclude  the assumption  that it rests  upon  some  rational  basis within  the  knowledge  and  experience  of the  legislators"). Other  interests only  arguably  within  the  scope  of  rights  may  be overprotected to  avoid errors of underprotection;  freedom  of speech is  an area  in  which prophylactic  categorical  presumptions  may be  warranted. See,  e.g., Vincent  Blasi, The Pathological Perspective  and the  First  Amendment, 85 COLUM. L.  REv.  449,  474 (1985) (emphasizing  the importance  of "confining the  range  of discretion  left to  future  decisionmakers  who  will  be called  upon to  make judgments  when  pathological  pressures are  most  intense"); cf Seth  F. Kreimer, Good Enough  for Government Work:  Two  Cheers  for Content Neutrality, 16 U. PA. J. CONST. L. 1261,  1264,  1279-87  (2014) (arguing  that the doctrine of content-neutrality  is most important in preventing petty village  tyrants from acting against idiosyncratic  voices).
266. See,  e.g., SULuvAN  &amp; FRASE, supra note 52, at  53-66  (describing  "implicit  proportionality principles"  in  the  standards  of review  used  in  equal  protection,  substantive  due  process, First Amendment,  and dormant commerce clause cases).
267. Dandridge v. Williams,  397 U.S. 471,  521  (1970) (Marshall,  J., dissenting)  (emphasizing "the character  of  the  classification  in question,  the  relative  importance  to individuals  in the  class discriminated against  of  the  governmental  benefits  that they do  not receive,  and the  asserted state interests  in support of the classification").

Some of these  benefits  relate primarily to use  of the  structured proportionality  doctrine  of Canada  and  similar  systems.  But  others -bringing  law closer to justice-derive  from  greater use  of proportionality principles  even  in differently or less  structured  contexts.268

## IV.  OBJECTIONS  AND  RESPONSES

Some objections  to proportionality  as  a  standard  for  review  would  apply, generally,  in any  constitutional  democracy.  These  objections -including to  its indeterminacy,  its asserted  intrusiveness,  its  potential  for inconsistent  applications,  its asserted irrationality,  and its claimed  incompatibility with  strong conceptions of rights -are discussed in Part A.  Other concerns  about proportionality  relate  to  particular  aspects  of U.S.  constitutional  law  and  culture;  these  are addressed in Part B.

## A. General  Objections to Proportionality  as a Standard  of  Review

Although  structured  proportionality  review's  responsiveness  to  legitimate government justification  could  help  to  protect  rights while  maintaining  effective  self-government, some  argue  that  this  very  flexibility  detracts from  its quality  as  law,  creating  an unacceptable  level  of indeterminacy.2 6 9  The weight to  give  the  indeterminacy  critique  depends  to  an  important  degree  on  what proportionality  review would  replace.  It is  one  thing if it replaces  a seemingly determinate  categorical test; 2 7 " but  if proportionality  doctrine  replaces  a  less structured "all  things  considered"  approach,  or an exception-riddled  set of cat-

ter Justice  Marshall and  served  as  his law  clerk  in October  Term 1977, my  appreciation  for his views came most fully into focus after I had studied comparative constitutional  law.

268. Cf. SULLIvAN  &amp; FRASE, supra note 52, at  6-7 (suggesting  that there  are  three  distinct tests  of proportionality"limiting  retributive"  proportionality that  constrains  liability  and  sanctions,  "alternative-means"  proportionality  testing  whether  less  intrusive  means  exist,  and "ends-benefits"  proportionality,  which  "compar[es]  a  single  measure  to  its  expected  benefits"). They argue that "every  government  intrusion into individual  autonomy  [should]  undergo  some form of proportionality  review unless  strict scrutiny or another more  restrictive standard applies." Id. at u.
269. See,  e.g., WEBBER, supra note 235, at 89-115; Stavros Tsakyrakis, Proportionality: An Assault on Human Rights?, 7 INT'L  J.  CONST.  L. 468,  470-72 (2009).
270. Such  a change  might still  improve the  overall  quality  of decisions;  whether  a  more flexible proportionality  standard  would  be  better  than  a  particular  categorical  rule  depends  on the quality of decisions  produced under each.

egorical  rules,  it  might  produce  a  more  disciplined  jurisprudence.  And  structured proportionality can co-exist with understandings  of rights as  "principles" requiring  optimization,2" or  as  "shields,"  requiring  legitimate  and  strong  reasons to interfere. 2 72

Another argument is  that proportionality  review  is  too intrusive  on legislatures,  establishing  a  standard  that  cannot  realistically  be  met. 73 A  version  of this argument, which Alexy refers  to as  the "highest point thesis,"  contemplating single right answers, 2 74 is  inconsistent  with  the recognition  by leading  proponents  of proportionality  of the existence  of significant  "zones"  of legislative "discretion," 2 75 in which  the  legislature's judgment  will  control.  It  is moreover inconsistent  with widespread  recognition  that proportionality  review,  with  its sequenced  steps,  is  capable  of being  applied  with  "variable  intensity."27 6  The related  claim that  "proportionality,"  like  balancing,  is  more  a legislative  than  a judicial  competence 2 ' ignores  the  degree  to  which  while  legislatures  and  executives  may  have  particular  knowledge  and  competence  about,  for  example, the scope  of national  security risks  and the best  means  to minimize those risks, courts  have more capacity  fairly to decide  questions of individual rights.27 8

See,  e.g., Choudhry, supra note  116, at 504 (arguing that the pitfall of  proportionality  analysis is  that  it does  not respond  to  the  "general  problem of how  to fashion  judicial  review  in  a rights-protecting democracy where governments often legislate with imperfect information").

SAGER, JUSTICE  IN  PLAINCLOTHES  72-76, 199-201  (2004). It bears  noting that  the task of a reviewing court may be conceptualized  not

There  are, to  be  sure,  institutional  concerns  with  using  "standards" like proportionality,  rather than "rules."  Non-judicial  actors,  like police,  may find it easier  to  implement  a  rule  than  a  standard. 79 Rules,  however,  can  lose  their ease  and  clarity  as  their  exceptions  proliferate. * Even  if  "categorical"  rules would  result  in  fewer  errors,  moreover,  a  standard  may  result  in  fewer  "serious"  errors,  or departures  from a  common sense  of constitutional justice,  than its "categorical"  counterpart.'

To  the  extent  proportionality  analysis  allows  courts  to  consider  more  factors, however,  the range  of reasonable applications  may be broader,  which may result in more consistency problems  in lower courts in the decentralized system of U.S. judicial review.12  Recent  experience with  categorical  rules  in the  United States suggests that neither  determinacy  nor respect for legislative  outcomes is  necessarily  protected  through  such  rules.2 8 Moreover,  the  U.S.  Supreme as  making  the  primary  determination  of the  proportionality  questions,  but  as  reviewing whether  a  reasonable  government  could  have reached  the  conclusion  it did,  possibly  with varying degrees  of deference  depending  on the  issue. See,  e.g., Gardbaum, supra note  34,  at 102 ("[R]eviewing  courts  should  ask  whether  a  legislature's  assessment  that  the  chosen means  [meet the suitability,  necessity  and proportionality  as  such  tests]  is  a reasonable  one. ... [T]he issues involved  tend to  be relatively  indeterminate  in the  sense that there  is  usually no one right answer but (a) a  range of reasonable ones and (b)  one or  more wrong or  unreasonable  ones.  Particularly  in this context,  the  task of  judicial  review  should  be limited  to weeding out the  latter."); id. at 89 (arguing  for  more deference  to  legislatures  than to executive  decision  makers); see also AILEEN  KAVANAGH,  CONSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  UNDER THE UK HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 240  (2009) (arguing  that courts  should not  assess proportionality  as  if they were the primary decision maker  but as  a "secondary" decision  maker,  owing some deference  to  Parliament);  de  Bdrca, supra note 1, 147-48  (summarizing  approaches  to  deference);  Rivers, supra note 245, at  205-06  (suggesting that the  intensity of proportionality  review should depend on the severity of the rights  infringement).

See Scalia, supra note  16,  at  1178-83  (favoring  "clear,  general  principle[s] of decision"  to promote "predictability");  Sullivan, supra note 16,  at 62-66  (discussing why rules  may  help promote consistency and predictability). While  there  is an important  interest in consistency, whether the results of such uniformity  are positive  overall  depends  in part  on the  quality of the rule articulated and how the results under that rule differ from the results under a differently worded standard.  Not every rule  is superior.
283. For cases  that created  new  exceptions  or  produced  unexpected  results  under  "categorical" rules,  see, for  example, Holder v. Humanitarian  Law Project, 561  U.S 1  (2010), which arguably abandons  truly  strict scrutiny  in  evaluating  limitations  on  speech  in  the  national  security context;  and R.A.V.  v.  City of  St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), which creates  an exception  to  the exception  from  the  ban  on  content-regulation  for  "fighting  words."  For  a  critique  of the claim  that categorical  rules  in the Fourth Amendment  context  are  helpful and  constraining guides  to the  police,  see Alschuler, supra note 248, at 231, which argues that  courts produce

Court's "'shrunken docket'"214  suggests  that it  has  substantial unused  capacity to  control  errors  and  promote  consistency  in  the  lower  courts: the  Court's docket  remains  roughly  half of  what  it  was decades  ago.28s  The Court  may be able  to  expand  its docket  and  use some of that  capacity  to minimize  inconsistencies in the lower courts' application of proportionality.

The  "proportionality  as  such"  element  of proportionality  review  has  been most widely  subject  to  critique,  as  unconstrained  "balancing"  of often  incommensurable values  and  based  only on  the preferences  of the judges.2 6 Indeed, some,  including  Jurgen  Habermas,  view  the  "proportionality  as  such"  test as essentially  irrational  because  it  requires  the  weighing  of  incommensurables lacking  a  common  metric. 8 Even  absent  a  common  metric,  however,  judg-

"an  unmanageable  multiplicity  of  rules"  that cannot be  humanly  remembered,  that present numerous  choices  regarding  which  rule  is  applicable,  and  whose  artificiality  begets  more rules  that "muddy  more than  they clarify"  and depart from both justice and predictability.

284. Arthur  D.  Hellman, The  Shrunken Docket  of the Rehnquist Court, 1996  SUP.  CT. REv. 403 (1996).  Hellman  suggested that  the declining  docket  of granted  cases resulted  in  part  from the  views  of recent  Justices  that  error  correction  is  not a  significant  task,  reflecting  a vision of an "Olympian Court" concerned  only with deciding large questions. Id. at 432-38. He also noted  possible  disadvantages  from  the smaller  docket,  including  the Court's failing to "engage in  the  process  of  developing  the law  through a  succession of cases  in the  common-law tradition,"  "creating  gaps  in  the  law,"  "impair[ing] the  quality  of the  Court's work  in  the cases  that it does  take"  by depriving  itself  of the knowedge of how a particular  issue "fits  into  its larger  setting,"  and fostering  "detachment from  the  work of lower  courts,"  noting,  as an  example, the  decision in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 8o6 (1996). Id. at 433-36. Whren is  discussed supra notes  161, 249, and infra note 325.

ments about the  relative priority  of two values  can be rational.2s 8 An example  is "large-small  trade-offs"  involving  a small  sacrifice  of one value for a  large  gain in  another.2 It  is  a  mistake  to understand  balancing  in mathematical  terms: rather,  "proportionality  as  such"  balancing  should  entail  a  reasoning  process about the priority of one constitutional value  as it relates  to another in a particular setting. 2 90 It is  also  worth  noting  that "proportionality  as  such"  is the last in a  sequence  of inquiries  and  therefore  is  part of a more  structured  decisional process  than "all  things  considered" balancing. 2 91

might  undermine the distinctively principled  character  of rights. 2 9 , Carol Steiker,  for  example,  has  suggested  that understanding proportionality to be  a necessary condition for government  action intruding on rights might lead to the idea  that proportionality  is sufficient, thereby  "[o]ccupying the  justificatory field." 2 " But  on some  accounts,  even  in jurisdictions  applying proportionality analysis,  one  can  recognize  "core" aspects  of rights  that are viewed  as  entirely non-abrogable  and not subject to  limitation by arguments from proportionality. 295 Judicial elaborations  of human dignity in Germany,  for example,  striking down  a  law  authorizing  the  shooting  down  of hijacked  civilian  aircraft, or  in Israel,  prohibiting  privatization of  prisons,  show  that deontological analysis can coexist  with extensive  use  of proportionality doctrine.29 6 Moreover,  structured proportionality analysis  itself leaves  room  for the conclusion  that a statute has  an impermissible  goal,  one  ruled out by the commitments  to maintain-

ing rights  in  a  free  and  democratic  society. 2 97 Beginning  the  analysis  with  an inquiry into purpose  and  then focusing  on  the  nature  of the  right and  the severity of its infringement  can help mitigate important concerns  with narrowing of the  "justificatory field. 298

## B.  Arguments  from Lack of  Fit  with U.S.  Constitutionalism

It  is  sometimes  argued  that  Canadian  or  European  approaches  to  rights analysis do  not fit well  with  already  developed  U.S.  constitutional  law.  To  be sure,  a  highly  contextualized  analysis  is  necessary  in  evaluating  whether  approaches  in one  legal  system  can  usefully  be  adapted  in another.  At  the  same time,  it  is important  to  recognize the  multiple  strands  of  possibilities  for change  within  particular  legal  cultures. 2 99 U.S.  constitutional  case  law  already includes  several  lines  informed  by the  basic  idea,  and  several  of the  doctrinal components,  of proportionality  review. Although  the United  States is  unlikely to  adopt  proportionality  as  a  general  principle  applicable  to  all  challenges  to government  action,  there  is good  reason  to  think that,  in  some discrete  areas, U.S.  constitutional  law could benefit from greater  use of both the principle and the structured doctrine of proportionality.

While  the United States does  not have the kind of limitations  clause found in  post-World War  II  constitutions,  U.S.  jurisprudence  recognizes  that limits

297. See,  e.g., R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [19851 S.C.R. 295 (Can.)  (invalidating  a statute found to  have  an  illegitimate  purpose  (coercing religious observance),  with  no  further  Section  1 analysis); see  also cases cited supra note 82.

298. See Perju, supra note 228, at 352 (arguing that inquiry  into government purpose  at the  outset of  proportionality analysis offers a theoretical possibility  of  deontological constraint). Deontological inquiry may also be required to determine the nature  of the right and severity of its  infringement. See BARAK, supra note 22, at 45-51 (describing  how  the  right's scope  is determined by  interpreting  constitutional  text,  and noting  distinction  between  "core"  and "penumbra"  of  right); see  also  supra notes 295-296; cf Perju, supra note 228, at  354 (discussing  the  "core"  and "periphery"  of rights). Perju  argues that  in practice  the potential of purpose  inquiries to  impose  constraints  has  not been  realized. Id. at 352-53. But see supra notes 82,  297 (discussing  Canadian cases finding insufficient  purpose). Determining what is a sufficient purpose  to warrant  an infringement  on rights  is itself connected  to  a conceptual understanding  of the right  and its  purpose.  Cf BARAK, supra note 22, at  248  (arguing  that purposes  sufficient to justify intrusion on rights  "may vary  ... from  one  right to another"). Some  critics argue that proportionality review, coupled with limitations clauses that expressly  acknowledge  that rights  may  be limited with  sufficient justification,  will  diminish rights protection as a  whole. See, e.g., Rao, supra note 126, at 227-37. Whether proportionality  review would have  this  effect is likely to be  highly context dependent.  In the context  of categorical  rules  that,  as  in Atwater, or Florence, arguably  under-protect  rights, proportionality  review would likely advance rights protection.

299. See Vicki C.  Jackson &amp; Jamal Greene, Constitutional  Interpretation  in Comparative Perspective: Comparing  Judges or Courts?, in COMPARATIVE  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW 599 (Tom Ginsburg &amp; Rosalind Dixon eds., 2011).

on  matters  ordinarily understood  as protected by rights can sometimes  be constitutionally  justified.  Indeed,  U.S.  constitutional  law  in  many  areas  contemplates  "triggering  rights"  that  generate  strict  review  but  that in  the  end,  may not  be  "final  rights"  because  the  "triggering  right"  may  be  subject  to  limitation. 3 0 0 Influences on contemporary  "limitations"  clauses  are many, but among them  is  the  provision  of Article  29  of the  Universal  Declaration  of Human Rights (UDHR), 3 "'  whose  language  was  influenced  by  a  proposal  from  an American Law  Institute (ALI) committee. 3 " 2 The German  Constitutional Court's influential  proportionality  doctrine  did not  derive  primarily  from  the express  limitations  clauses  of the Basic Law but rather from judicial elaboration of  constraints  on  government  regulation  in  the  course  of interpreting  police law in  the  nineteenth  century. 3 0 3 And,  as  Stephen  Gardbaum  has  argued,  notwithstanding  the  absence  of an explicit  limitations  clause,  basic approaches  to rights  interpretation  in the United  States  have much  in common with  those  in countries  explicitly using proportionality  review. 3 4

Nonetheless,  some scholars have  suggested that U.S.  legal culture  is  hostile to  proportionality  review.  They  argue  that balancing  in  the United  States  developed  as  an effort  to  limit the power  of courts  (acting  on behalf of rights)  to

In the exercise  of his  rights  and freedoms,  everyone  shall  be subject  only  to  such limitations as  are determined  by law solely for the  purpose of securing due recognition and  respect  for  the rights  and  freedoms  of others  and  of meeting  the just requirements of morality, public order and the  general welfare in a democratic  society.

interfere  with  legislative  outcomes, rather  than,  as  in  Germany,  as  a  way  of formalizing  and  protecting  rights. 305 Dennis is  sometimes  described  as  "symboliz[ing]  to  this  day  the most troubling risk of balancing:  the danger of judicial  capitulation  to  the  legislature's  determination  of the  balance  of interest in times  of national security crisis," a case  whose  "stigma" led the Court thereafter to  "dissociate[]"  itself  from  balancing.3o 6 This  adverse  reaction  to  balancing was,  in  important part, historically contingent,"' and may  now  be weakening, at least in national-security  inflected First  Amendment  case  law.

Even  if we  assume  that the predominantly categorical  conceptual  structure of free  speech  law  will  survive,  there  are  a  number  of  areas  of  contemporary constitutional rights law  in which  the U.S.  does  use  balancing, or even  proportionality.38  Richard Fallon,  in describing strict scrutiny, notes  that in addition to  sometimes functioning  as  a  close-to categorical rule,  at  other  times  strict scrutiny is  applied  as if it were  "a weighted  balancing  test,  similar to European proportionality  inquiries." 0 9 Moreover, outside  of  cases governed  by  strict scrutiny, balancing tests  are alive  and well,  and not necessarily  hostile  to  rights

American constitutional law,  as  a pragmatic exception  to  the construction of rights as categorical  limitations on state power"); cf BOMHOFF, supra note  2,  at 143-89  (noting  balancing's development  in the  U.S.  as an alternative  in contest  with more "absolutist" approaches,  still  viewed  through the lens  of debates  in the  1950s  and 1960s  about balancing).

307.  Aleinikoffs  attack on  balancing,  and Justice Scalia's argument for rule-like  approaches,  published within two  years  of each  other,  may  have  been  important influences  on  the historical trajectory. See Aleinikoff, supra note  15;  Scalia, supra note  16. Justice  Scalia's argument- that the  rule  of law  is  best understood as  a law  of rules -ignores the  important role  of equitable traditions in shaping law  to apply justly to  concrete  facts.  Compare Aristotle's  discussion  of the need  for rectification of inequitable applications of general rules:

[A]ll  law  is  universal  and yet  there are  some  things  about which it is  not  possible to make  correct universal pronouncements. . . . [W]henever  the law makes  a universal  pronouncement,  but things  turn out  in a  particular case contrary  to  the 'universal' rule,  on  these  occasions  it is  correct,  where  there is  an omission  by the lawgiver,  and he  has  gone wrong by  having made an unqualified pronouncement, to  rectify the deficiency  by reference  to what the lawgiver  himself would have  said if he  had been  there .. ..  And this is the nature of the  reasonable:  a rectification of law,  in so  far as law  is deficient  because  of its universal  aspect.

Indeed, Fallon  has noted more generally  the  resonances  between  strict scrutiny and proportionality analysis. See  id. at  1295  (discussing  the  narrow  tailoring  requirement); cf,  e.g., Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S. 113 (1973)  (balancing  the liberty  interests of pregnant women  against  state  interests  in health and fetal  life  to identify  permitted regulation at different stages  of pregnancy).

protection.  In Hamdi v.  Rumsfeld,"'° the plurality  drew  on  the 1976 decision  in Mathews v.  Eldridge" for "[t]he  ordinary  mechanism  that we  use for balancing such serious  competing interests"  to  decide what process was due  an American citizen  detained  as  an  enemy  combatant. 3 12 The  invocation  of balancing  was rights-protecting  insofar  as  the  government  had  argued  that "'[r]espect for separation  of powers  and the  limited  institutional capabilities  of courts  in matters of military decision-making  in  connection with  an ongoing  conflict' ought to  eliminate  entirely any individual process,  restricting  the courts  to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme." 3 1 "  The  Court  rejected  this  and  other  arguments. 3 1 4 A  more  accurate way  to  describe U.S.  constitutional  law  is  thus  that  in  important  areas  the Court relies  on balancing tests  but does  so in  a less  systematic way  than its  Canadian  or German counterparts.

Some scholars argue further that U.S.  constitutional  law focuses  on the "intent" of government  actors, not the "effects"  of  their actions,  in defining constitutional  rights,  an  approach  claimed  to  be  incompatible  with  proportionality's concern  both with a challenged  act's purpose  and its effects. 3 "  But in some areas,  narrowly focused  intent tests have only recently- and contestedly -replaced more  effects-oriented  aproaches.31 6 One  should  not  mistake  a  phenomenon that  is  no  doubt  present  in  some  areas  for  a  more  general  state  of affairs. 17 There  are  other significant  swathes of U.S.  constitutional  law  that are  or have been effects-oriented.

It  could  be  argued,  however,  that the  "balancing" approach  adopted by the Court was also rights-undermining,  insofar as it facilitated rejecting  the  position,  argued  by Justice  Scalia,  that  for a  citizen,  detention  and trial  had to be  by ordinary  criminal  process,  with  speedy  trial  rights  and  the  full  panoply  of criminal procedure  rights, see  id. at 572 (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting),  a position  the  plurality rejected, id. at 522-24 (plurality opinion).

Since 1997, Casey's "undue  burden"  test has  asked whether  a  regulation has  the  "purpose  or  effect"  of  creating  a  substantial  obstacle  to  a  woman's choosing  to  abort  a  pre-viable  fetus."  And  in  Fourth  Amendment  law,  the Court  has  determinedly  turned  away  from  intent.  The Court  has  insisted  that

Washington,  466  U.S.  668,  687 (1984) (articulating  two standards to  guide ineffective assistance of  counsel  claims:  factual  deficiency in counsel's performance and prejudicial  effect).

the actual  intent of police  officers  in making a stop  or arrest is  irrelevant;  what matters  is  whether  there  was  an  objective  basis  for a "reasonable  suspicion"  or for probable  cause;  the fact that the  police may actually have been motivated  to make  a stop  because  of the  suspect's race,  or preexisting  bias  against  the suspect,  is  not relevant  under the Fourth Amendment. 2 5 In this light,  it is  not accurate  to describe  U.S. law  as having  a general  propensity only  to  be concerned with intent and not with effects.

Recent  scholarship  has  also  suggested  that the  United  States is  more  skeptical  about  the possibilities  of law  in the  hands  of  judges  (and thus  of proportionality  review)  than  are  Canada  or  Germany.32 6 The  United  States  is,  to  be sure,  more  willing  to  leave  to  democratic  processes  decisions  that,  elsewhere, would  be  made  by  more  expert,  elite  decision  makers  (as  in the  popular election  of judges  in  many  states  within  the  United  States).  The  U.S.  Supreme Court  is an  empowered,  activist Court,  however,  even  without proportionality review;  it  has  invalidated  a  significant  number  of federal  statutory  provisions since the  early 198os,  in cases  that include INS v.  Chadha,"  NFIB v.  Sebelius,32 8

Bomhoff as well  as Cohen-Eliya  and Porat assume,  in  talking  about  constitutional  law,  that  the  object  of discussion  is  judicial  decisions;  suspicion of law, in  this  context,  is  suspicion  of  judge-made  law.

335. Canada's constitution includes another  device  that could theoretically  be  viewed as promoting such dialogues:  the provisions of Charter  Section 33 permitting  a provincial or national parliament to "override"  certain  Charter  freedoms  for up to five  years. See Canadian  Charter of Rights  and Freedoms,  Part I of the  Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the  Canada Act, 1982, c. 11, § 33  (U.K.). In  practice,  Section 33 (also  known as  the  "Notwithstanding Clause")  has been  seldom used outside  Quebec and its use has been criticized  for not achieving  dialogical  goals. See,  e.g., Mark  Tushnet, Policy Distortion  and Democratic Debilitation: Comparative Illumination of the  Countermajoritarian Difficulty, 94 MICH. L.  REV. 245,  275-95 (1995); see also Stephen  Gardbaum, Separation  of  Powers and the  Growth of  Judicial Review in Established Democracies (or  Why  Has the Model  of  Legislative Supremacy  Mostly Been  Withdrawn  from Sale?), 62  AM.

Other  kinds of objections  to  proportionality  review  flow from  general  interpretive  approaches  in  the  United  States.  Originalist  claims  are  a distinctive feature  of contemporary  U.S.  constitutional  law;  their force  owes  much  to  a historically  specific reaction  to the  Warren  Court's legacy.33 6  Those  committed to  resolving  constitutional  controversies  only  by resort  to  the  "specific  meaning" of  constitutional  provisions  at the time of the founding would presumably make  less  use  of proportionality-like  analyses. For  most  Justices,  however, original  understandings  are  only the  beginning  and  not  the  end  of analysis, 337 and some  questions  simply cannot be  resolved by resort to  specific  original understandings.

Some academic proponents  of proportionality  go too far in suggesting  that text  and precedents  do not matter.1 8 In so  doing  they ignore  important  foundations  of law's legitimacy.  Texts  and  their  history  and  purpose  matter:  proportionality  alone  cannot  provide  a  substantive  theory  of what  interests  are within  the  scope  of rights. Specificity  matters: a  constitution  requiring  payment  of "just compensation" for  the  taking  of property  imposes  constraints that  may  not be  enforced  in  its  absence.  Stare  decisis  emphasizes  the  role  of precedent  in  constitutional  adjudication (except  where  departures  are  sufficiently justified),  thereby linking past,  present,  and future  in a stable but flexible  continuity.  The  long  lines  of precedent in  many  areas  of individual  rights, the different  character  of different  rights,  and  other  factors  discussed  below, caution  against  any massive  reconstruction  of U.S.  constitutional  law through the lens  of proportionality.

## V. DEFINING  THE  BOUNDARIES  FOR  PROPORTIONALITY  REVIEW

I  do not argue  that the  United States should embrace proportionality  across the board.  For one  thing,  the U.S. Constitution does not provide  as clear  a textual  basis as  exists  in  Canada  for  the adoption of proportionality  as a pervasive

336. See Jamal  Greene, Selling Originalism, 97 GEo. L.J.  657,  659-60, 674-82 (2009).

337. On  the range  of sources  regarded  as legitimate  in  the  "eclectic"  U.S.  approach  to  constitutional  interpretation, see  JACKSON, supra note  118,  at  134-38;  Fallon, A Constructivist Coherence  Theory, supra note  233; and Mark  Tushnet, The  United States: Eclecticism in the Service of Pragmatism, in INTERPRETING CONSTITUTIONS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 7 (Jeffrey Goldsworthy  ed., 2006). See also supra note 233.

338. See, e.g., BEATTY, supra note 1, at 47,  87-89  (praising  reliance  on  "facts"  rather  than  "text" and  critiquing  reliance  on  precedent); cf M6LLER, supra note 29, at 57-90, 88  (describing the  "comprehensive," "protected  interests"  conception  of autonomy,  and  concluding  that "nothing would  be lost  in  theory  by simply acknowledging  one  comprehensive  prima facie right  to  personal  autonomy"  instead  of listing  specific  rights,  such  as  freedom  of expression).

test. 339 The U.S.  Supreme  Court  is  not  in  the position  of the  Canadian  courts interpreting  the 1982 Charter,  nor  the  German  Court  interpreting  the 1949 Basic Law;  the United States  has no new charter of rights  subject to interpretation for the  first time. And the United States is  a large country,  with highly decentralized opportunities  for judicial review  in multiple court systems;  a  greater need may  exist for categorical rules to achieve acceptable levels of consistency  in the  law  (even  if the Supreme  Court were  to  expand  its docket). Moreover,  where reasonably well-functioning  lines of law exist, developed over time,  there  may be  insufficient  reason  to  unsettle  the  law.  Not all  rights  protected by  the  Constitution  involve  the kinds  of principles  that can best  be applied  through  ideas of proportionality.  Some rights  may  be better  understood as  concrete  rules,  requiring  particular  procedures  to legalize  the  government's use  of  coercive  power." Other  rights  can  be  better  viewed  as  normatively nonderogable guarantees.4'

Finally,  even  when  rights  have  components  concerned  with  promoting proportionate  government conduct,  case-by-case  application  of  proportionality standards  may not be the best approach;  formal application  of a categorical  rule over the course of  cases  may  result in  a better group of  decisions overall. 4 2 Given  the draw  of  consistency  in adjudication,  moreover,  rules are  likely to emerge even  from case-by-case  applications  of a proportionality  standard; 3 and  what some  call  "definitional  balancing"  or  "categorical  balancing"  might be  reconceptualized  to reflect  conceptions  of proportionality  in  light of the purposes  of the  right and its  implementation  in a decentralized  system of justice.  The  goal of proportionality  in  government action,  in  the sense of justice  and  good  governance  by  actual  institutions,  may  sometimes  be  better  served by  more  categorical  rules."  How  then should judges  determine  whether an  area calls  for a more categorical, or case-by-case  application of proportionality standards?

44. To  the extent  that proportionality  tests  are  concerned,  in  part,  with  the effects  of government  actions,  this  possibility  corresponds  with  the concept  of "rule-consequentialism," as compared  with  "act-consequentialism." See Brad  Hooker, Rule Consequentialism, STAN.

## A. Different  Rights, Different  Roles, Diferent Texts

Not all  rights  have  the same  conceptual  structure. 45 Nor  do all  rights  play the  same  role  within the  constitutional  system.  Some  rights,  like  those  associated with  the  Establishment  Clause,  have  been  viewed  by  some  as  concerned primarily  with  "excluded  reasons"  for  government  action.4 6 Doctrine  implementing  rights,  like  those  secured  by  the  Fifth  Amendment  Takings  Clause, may on occasion draw  on proportionality  principles  to analyze nonphysical  actions  of government  that  are  claimed  to  constitute  takings,4 7 but at  the  same time treat even  minor permanent  physical  invasions  as per  se  takings  for conceptual  or historical  reasons.4 Further,  the  text of that right specifically  provides the remedy for when a taking of property occurs -that is, payment of  just compensation. 349

The  First Amendment's protections  of freedom  of speech  and association function  as broad  guarantors  of  democracy,  securing  freedom  of  political  competition;  they prohibit  government  conduct  motivated  by a  desire  to  suppress dissent;  and  they  secure  a  host  of individual  expressive  freedoms.  The  First Amendment is  also  arguably  emblematic  of a  particular  form of constitutional identity  for  the  United  States. 3 Application  of proportionality  analysis  in  an individual case-by-case  way might be considered  inconsistent with  the symbolic importance of treating the First Amendment as providing strong protections. But  there  is  no  conceptual obstacle to  providing strong  rights protection through proportionality  analysis by treating a government purpose to suppress

ideas as  per se illegitimate  and by treating the value of freedom of expression as presumptively  stronger than reasons  for suppression  in the "proportionality  as such"  stage.  Still, categorical  statements of presumptive  rules  might be thought to accomplish  this  in ways more  consistent with  symbolic or expressive  aspects of  this  amendment  (and  its  "shall  make  no  law"  text).  But  such  categorical rules -including categorical exclusions for regulation for obscenity3s' or fighting  words 35 2 -can  themselves  be  informed  by  considerations  of proportionality. The  possibility of  identity-reinforcing benefits in framing First Amendment jurisprudence  in  the  form  of presumptive  categorical  rules  does not answer what those rules  should be or what  exceptions  to a categorical  presumption against content-based  regulation  should be recognized.

Use of proportionality doctrine  to review the reasonableness  of  a  search is  a different matter  than its  use to  review  free  speech  claims.  The Fourth Amendment's text  protects  "[t]he  right  of the  people  to  be  secure  in  their  persons, houses,  papers,  and effects,  against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures  .. . .33 Strong considerations  of the rule  of law  and of popular  conceptions  of justice would  support  a  proportionality  approach  to some  Fourth Amendment  issues now  governed  by categorical  rules.  Some years  ago  a scholar wrote:  "When an officer  acts  reasonably,  it  would  torture  the English  language  to  condemn  his action  as  an  unreasonable  search.""  Likewise, when  an officer acts  "unreasonably,"  as  the  officer  did  in Atwater, it  tortures  any popular  sense  of what  the Fourth Amendment  means  to  find no  violation.  To  treat  the Fourth  Amendment as favoring categorical  rules  to the same degree  as the seemingly more  absolute  language  of the  First Amendment  is  to  suggest  that  the  text  does  not matter. 35 And  to  assume  that  the  proliferation  of categorical  rules  will  help constrain  rather  than liberate  official  discretion  of police officers  may be  more heroic than realistic.3'

## B.  Remedial Constraints

Adjudications  of liability  are  always  nested  in particular remedial  systems. The  remedies  available  or  required,  and  their  consequences,  may  have  constraining  effects on how courts are willing to define the underlying right."'

## 1. The Exclusionary  Rule

In  the  United  States,  Fourth  Amendment  remedial  rules  requiring  exclusion  of evidence  have been applied,  at  least for a  time,  in a  seemingly  categorical  manner."' By contrast,  in Canada  the consequence  of finding a  violation of Charter  rights  is  not  necessarily exclusion  of the  evidence:  under  Charter Section 24, courts  decide,  case  by  case,  whether  admitting  the  evidence  would "bring the administration  of  justice  into disrepute." 3 59 The  apparent  rigidity  of the U.S.  exclusionary rule  may thus militate against more generous  interpretation of the right because  of the consequences  to criminal justice administration. Yet  proportionality  approaches  might  also  support  modifications  in  the  U.S. approach  to the  exclusionary rule.3 6 0

More  recently,  the extent to which  the exclusionary  rule  applies  categorically  to  evidence  obtained  in violation  of the Fourth Amendment  has  been  under serious  debate. See Herring  v.  United  States,  555  U.S. 135,  140-46  (2009); id. at 148-57  (Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting); id. at 157-59 (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting); see  also Adam  Liptak, Supreme  Court Eases  Limits  on  Evidence, N.Y.

William  Stuntz suggested  that the absence  of attention to proportionalityincluding  the  "blindness  to  differences  among  crimes"-is  one of the deepest problems  in Fourth Amendment  law.361  The  trans-substantive  doctrine  of the Fourth Amendment,  he  argued,  created a  "reasonableness"  gap in the application of the Fourth Amendment's substantive  standard.3 6 2  Stuntz  also suggested that while the U.S.  version  of the exclusionary  rule serves many useful purposes, the remedy  has  adversely affected the crafting of  substantive Fourth Amendment  doctrine  and  misdirected resources  away  from more  fundamental questions  of guilt  or innocence.3 6 3 Given  the  number of existing  exceptions  to the  exclusionary  rule,  it  is  possible  that  more  might  be  gained  than  lost  by adopting  a  more proportionate  approach both  to the  substantive  standards  of the amendment and, possibly,  even to the consequences  of  illegality.3 6 4

See  id. at 871 n.94  (noting that the extension of the exclusionary  rule  to  states  "not only defined the Fourth Amendment's primary remedy  but shaped its  content  as  well, by ensuring that most  Fourth Amendment  law would be made  in the context of motions  to suppress  incriminating  evidence");  Stuntz, supra note 232, at  38-39, 50 (arguing  that the  suppression remedy attracts  resources  to suppression  hearings  rather than substantive  defenses,  and that "[t]he  manner in  which suspects  are arrested-how much force  the police use, and whether they tend  to use  more force on some kinds of suspects than  others -is  regulated  only slightly,  because  police  violence  tends  not  to be  tied  to  police  evidence  gathering,  and only  evidence gathering is likely to give rise to exclusionary  rule claims").
364. Some Justices  argued  for  modification  of the  exclusionary  rule  in the 1970s, invoking  foreign experience in  doing so. See California v.  Minjares, 443  U.S. 916,  919 (1979)  (Rehnquist, J., dissenting  from denial of  a stay);  Stone v.

## 2. Equal  Protection

Distinct remedial challenges are posed  by successful equal protection claims,  as their  redress may  require  changes  adversely  affecting  nonparties. For example,  if a  benefit  is  made  available  on  terms  found  discriminatory,  there may be options  to  equalize  down, as well as up.36s Remedial  complications may help explain  why  courts  that  apply proportionality  principles  in equality  cases do  so  more  deferentially  in  evaluating  challenges  to  economic  or  commercial regulations.3 66

,

Given  respect  for democratic  decision  making,  interests  in  the  stablity  of law,  and  concern  for the  reasonable  expectations  of third parties,  there are  reasons  for  caution  in  the  application  of equal  protection  standards  to the  great mass of  legislation.367  Indeed,  in Washington v.  Davis, 68 the  Court rejected disparate  impact based  on  race  as  a trigger for strict  scrutiny,  expressing  concern that  many  statutes  could  not  meet  the  standards  of justification  required  by strict-then usually  fatal-scrutiny. Experience with  proportionality review elsewhere  suggests  that  equal  protection  review  could  be  implemented in  a more proportionate  way,  one  that does  not automatically  invalidate  laws with such disparate impacts  and  that can  recognize  differences  in the severity of impacts,  especially on historically disadvantaged  groups.3 6

rule  "is  unique  to American  jurisprudence"  and  not followed  in  either England  or Canada). Reconsidering  U.S.  law  in  light  of proportionality  tees  up  this  issue;  resolving  it requires more analysis than space here  permits.

365. See Paul  Brest, The Supreme Court, 1975 Term-Foreword:  In Defense of the Antidiscrimination Principle, 90  HARV. L.  REv. 1,  36-43  (1976) (discussing  remedial  problems  that  may  arise from disparate  impact liability  under the Equal Protection Clause).  Severability analysis  may be  important, as  courts work to determine whether the  legislature would prefer to see a benefit extended  or withdrawn.  Extended  times for  legislative compliance  might  also  be called for  were  equal  protection  doctrine  to  become  more  robust.  In Germany,  when  the  Federal Constitutional  Court  finds  a  statute  incompatible  with  the  equality  guarantees  of the German Basic Law,  the Court may  decide not to  invalidate  the statute  but declare  only that it is "incompatible"  with  the Basic Law and allow  a set period of time for the legislature  to enact new  legislation.

Proportionality  in equal protection  review resonates  with Justice Thurgood Marshall's "sliding scale"  view of equal  protection law. 37 0 In Dandridge  v.  Williams, the Court  used  relaxed  "rational  basis"  review  to  uphold  a state  welfare law  imposing  a cap  on  benefits  for  families  with  dependent  children  that  had the effect  of giving less  per child  for children  in families  above  a  certain  size. 3 71 For  Justice  Marshall,  who  dissented, there  were  differences  of constitutional magnitude  between  classifications  affecting  businesses  and  classifications  affecting  poor  children.  These  differences  could  be  explained  by  reference  to proportionality  and a  form  of "process"  theory  that Justice  Marshall  explicitly invoked.

A case  involving  "'the most basic economic  needs  of impoverished  human beings,"' Justice  Marshall wrote, should not be reviewed under a mere  rationality  standard. 3 7 2 Such  a rationality  standard  accepted  "extremes ... in  dreaming up  rational  bases for  state regulation"  because of "a  healthy  revulsion from  the Court's earlier  excesses  in  using the Constitution  to  protect interests  that have more than enough power to protect  themselves  in the legislative halls." 373 Here, Justice  Marshall  drew  an  implicit  contrast  between  the interests  of businesses, which  can  "protect  themselves in  the  legislative  halls,"  and  the  interests  of much  less  powerful,  poor  human  beings,  including  children. 37 4 He  explained that  where "the  literally vital  interests  of a powerless  minority[,]  poor families without breadwinners,"  are  involved,  "the relative importance  to individuals  in the  class  discriminated  against  of the  governmental  benefits  that they  do  not receive"  required more  careful  analysis of the government's asserted  reasons for the  law. 7 5  Justice  Marshall's emphasis  on the relative importance  of the rights is  a  plea  for  more  proportionality  in reviewing  standards  and  in  the justifications governments must proffer for the distinctions  that their laws  create.376

376. For  similar  reasons,  Justice  Marshall  famously dissented  in San Antonio  Independent School District  v.  Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1,  109  (1973), arguing that because "discrimination  against important  individual  interests  with  constitutional implications  and  against particularly  disadvantaged or powerless  classes  is involved,"  the Court should have more carefully scrutinized Texas's scheme  relying  on  local  property  taxes  to  fund  the free  public  education  the  State guaranteed  its citizens.

Justice  Marshall's  rejection  of  "a  priori  definition[s]" 3 7 in  defining  the standard  of  review  reverberates with  Justice  Stevens's  later  argument that "[t]here is  only  one  Equal  Protection  Clause, "37 with  a  common  standard: whether a legislature acting  in good faith rationally could believe that the harm it was  imposing was justified  in  support  of a greater  good.  A  single  standard can be implemented with varying degrees  of seriousness  depending  on the impact of the  classification.  An example of this  kind of approach  may be found in Plyler v.  Doe. 379 Striking  down  a  Texas statute  denying  public  education  to children  who reside illegally in  the country, the Court wrote:

In  determining  the  rationality  of  [the  statute],  we  may  appropriately take  into  account  its  costs  to  the  Nation  and  to  the  innocent  children who  are  its  victims.  In  light of these  countervailing  costs,  the discrimination contained  in  [the statute]  can  hardly be considered rational  unless  it furthers  some  substantial goal of the  State.3 8 o

The idea in this  passage  from Plyler is  that where the  harm is  great,  a  rational legislator  would  need  much  more  convincing  evidence  of likely  effectiveness towards  a  "substantial  goal"  before  she  could  conclude  that  it  was  rational  to impose the harm.3 8 ' This idea  is consistent with both Justice  Stevens's and Justice Marshall's approaches,  as  well as with the central  idea of  proportionality.

J.,  dissenting); see  also Rodriguez, 411  U.S. at 109 (Marshall,  J., dissenting)  (rejecting  the  majority's  suggestion that "a  variable  standard  of review  would give  this  Court the  appearance  of a 'super-legislature,"'  because  such  an approach is  a  necessary  "part of the  guarantees  of  our Constitution and of the historic experiences  with oppression  of  and  discrimination  against  discrete,  powerless  minorities  which  underlie that document").

L.  REv.  130,  134  (1982) (rejecting  the  dissenting position  but criticizing the  majority for a  lack of clarity  on whether  it was  status as undocumented  children  or the fact that education  was involved that led to  heightened  scrutiny). See also Michael J.  Perry, Equal Protection, Judicial  Activism,  and the Intellectual Agenda of Constitutional Theory: Reflections on, and Beyond, Plyler  v.  Doe,  44 U.  Prr. L. REv.  329  (1983) (describing  the  case  as  providing  the correct  answer to a politcal-moral problem but questioning  its theoretical basis  in the  equal protection clause).

As  noted earlier,  disproportionality  in  the  effects  of laws,  especially  where laws  have  particularly  adverse impact  on  traditionally  discriminated  against groups,  may be  a signal  of process  failures  tainted  by prejudices.3 8 2  It  may  reflect  a  "deliberate  indifference"  that  is  a  close  cousin  to  more  active  forms  of prejudice.38,  Rather than relying  on tiers  of review as  on-off switches  indicating when reasons  must be more substantial,  courts  might view disparate  impact on historically  disadvantaged  groups (especially  if less harmful  alternatives towards  the  asserted  goals  exist),  as  signalling  a potential  process  failure  requiring higher levels  of  justification.384

Indeed,  the  rigidly  separated  "tiered"  standards  of review  may  have  led  to the  narrowed  understanding  of the  substantive  scope  of the Equal  Protection Clause in Washington v.  Davis.38s Although  some have suggested  that U.S.  con-

"Deliberate  indifference"  is  the standard  used to  evaluate  claims  that refusals  or  failures  to protect  prisoners  against substantial  risks of serious  harm,  or to provide  prisoners  with appropriate  medical  treatment  for  serious  illness  or  injury,  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment's ban  on  "cruel and  unusual" punishments.

Ely  was  concerned primarily  with  identifying  invidious motives.  He  rejected  arguments  for judicial  review  of legislation  distributing  benefits  not  constitutionally  required  in  the  absence  of invidious purpose;  indeed, he  rejected  arguments  that disparate  impact alone  could  violate  the Equal Protection  Clause. ELY, supra note 122, at 136-45.  If one believes  that government  has  an obligation  to deal  impartially with  its  citizens,  however,  a  substantially  disparate  impact on a traditionally  disadvantaged group,  if insufficiently justified,  might itself evince an  invidious denial  of the impartiality  to which  the Equal  Protection Clause  aspires. See Barbara  J.  Flagg, "Was Blind But Now I See":  White Race Consciousness and the Requirement of Discriminatory Intent, 91 MICH.  L.

stitutional  law is  generally  oriented towards  the prohibition  only of intentionally violative  acts,38 6 this is  not a  sufficient explanation  for Washington v.  Davis. At that time, as  the Court noted,  "there [were]  some  indications"  in the Court's own case  law  that  intent was  not  the critical  factor  in making  out  Fourteenth Amendment violations.387As  the Court also indicated,  various courts of appeals had  treated  disparate  impact  alone  as  triggering  heightened  scrutiny3 88 :  such court of appeals  decisions,  the  Court  fair-mindedly  said,  "impressively  demonstrate that there  is another  side  to the  issue"38' within the existing  interpretive resources  of  U.S. constitutional  law.

An important  element in the Court's  interpretation of equal  protection law was its  concern  that allowing  equal  protection  claims  "based solely  on  [a]  statistically disproportionate  racial  impact" would have sweeping effects  on a wide range  of important  laws. 390 For example,  the Court wrote,  such jurisprudence might  eliminate  "various  provisions  of the  Social  Security  Act"  and  "a  whole range  of tax,  welfare, public  service,  regulatory,  and licensing  statutes that may be  more burdensome  to the poor and to the average  black  than to the more affluent white." 3 ' For the  Court, "'acceptance of appellants' constitutional theory would  render  suspect  each  difference  in  treatment  among  the  grant  classes, however lacking  in racial motivation  and  however otherwise  rational the treat-

It seems clear that the Court did not reach its  conclusion  because it thought racially  disproportionate  effect  was  of no  concern;  disparate  impact  was  "not irrelevant." 94 Motivating  the decision  in Washington v.  Davis in important part were  the remedial  consequences  for  a broad  range  of statutes  under  the  thenusually  fatal  "strict  scrutiny" tier. 395 Given  the  categorical  structure  of  twotiered  review  that existed  when Washington v.

Davis, 426 U.S.  at 246 ("Even agreeing  with the District Court that the differential  racial effect of Test 21 called  for  further inquiry, we  think the  District  Court correctly held  that the affirmative  efforts  of  the  Metropolitan Police  Department  to  recruit  black officers, the changing racial  composition of  the recruit classes  and of the force in general . . . and the  relationship of the test  to the training program negated  any  inference  that the Department  discriminated on the basis of  race  or that 'a police  officer qualifies  on the color of  his  skin rather than ability."'

395. But cf COHEN-ELIYA &amp; PORAT, PROPORTIONALITY, supra note 3,  at  66  (viewing  U.S.  constitutional  law  as  a whole  as  "an intent-based  [system] ... [that]  construes  the  Constitution and judiciary  as  the mechanisms  for  striking  down  wrongly motivated  actions").  As  noted earlier, supra note 317, Cohen-Eliya  and Porat acknowledge  some exceptions,  not only  for a "'consequentialist constraint'  in an otherwise  deontologically oriented  system," id. at 72, but also  where  there  is  state  "indifference"  to effects,  as  in  the  dormant  commerce clause  case law,  id.  at 74-75.  The willingness  to consider  "indifference"  in dormant commerce clause  but not in race-  or gender-based equality  claims suggests that more is going on than  a supposed aversion  to  effects-based  tests can  account for. See Pers.  Adm'r of Mass. v.  Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979) (holding that  indifference  to  adverse  impacts on  historically disadvantaged groups  ordinarily  does  not trigger  heightened  review  for equal  protection  violations).  U.S. constitutional  law  does  not  so  generally  focus  on  "intent,"  see  text  accompanying supra notes 316-325, as  to  make  implausible  the idea  that  something  more was  at  the root  of the Washington v.  Davis rule.
396. See Note, supra note 378,  at 1147 (describing  how,  until 1976, there  was only  two-tiered review). The Court did  not adopt intermediate  scrutiny for gender classifications until Craig  v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190  (1976), decided  in December, 1976, six  months  after Washington v.  Davis. Many statutes  at  the  time  would  presumably  have  had  some adverse  impact based  on race-because  of links  between  race  and  poverty and,  possibly,  because  of the  exclusion  of African  Americans  for most of  the  prior  century  from  full participation  in  the elections  of lawmaking bodies.

Feeney, 39 7 the gap  between strict  scrutiny for facial uses  of race  (or intermediate scrutiny for gender classifications)  and rational basis  review  for facially  neutral laws with known disparate  impacts widened.39 8

Some  of the  Court's recent  cases  have  moved  away  from  reliance  on  rigid tiers,  without clearly  indicating what  is  in its  place. 399 A standard  focused  not only  on  the  nature  of the classification  but  also  on  the  relative  nature  of the harm complained of and its  relationship  to the particular government  interests at stake would allow courts  the  flexibility to hold legislatures  accountable  without  invalidating  most  legislation.  Such  a change  in  approach  would  help  answer critiques  of the Court's position  on disparate  impact.  Failing to  recognize disparate  impact  obscures  some  invidiously  motivated  conduct  that  does  take place, and does not recognize the constitutional harm  to equal protection of the law that can  result from  unconscious  bias or from deliberate  indifference  to  the situation of minority groups by members of more privileged  groups. 4 0  A more flexible  standard  for  reviewing  equal  protection  claims  could  treat  disparate impacts  differently  from  overt  or  intentional  uses  of race,  without  suggesting that disparate  impact  on a  racial  minority group,  or other historically  discriminated-against group,  creates  no greater  constitutional  concern than distinctions between businesses for tax purposes.

More  specifically,  the  use  of neutral  criteria,  claimed  to  have  a  disparate impact  on already  disadvantaged  groups,  need  not be  treated  as presumptively unconstitutional  in  order  to  require  some  real  scrutiny  of the  reasons  for the practice  under  a  single  standard  of review.  Rather,  a  substantial  "disparate" impact on a  minority  group long  subject  to  discrimination  might be  viewed as a signal  of  a possible process  failure,  reflecting the operation of  unconscious  bias  or deliberate  indifference.  Such a finding  might be viewed as  requiring -not the  kind of scrutiny  that  overt  uses  of race  require -but some  degree  higher than that  applied  to  challenges  to  economic  legislation  that is  not  claimed  to impair  fundamental  rights  or  rely on suspect  classifications. 40 '  Indeed,  similar

397. 442 U.S. 256  (1979) (holding that a knowing use  of a preference for veterans,  despite its very substantial  adverse  effect  on women, did not  require  more than rational basis review;  only if such  a neutral  criteria  is  used "because of' the  adverse  effects  on  gender is  heightened  scrutiny  appropriate).

401. Where a disparate  impact falls on  a group whose long history of  persecution  gave  rise to the decision  to treat the classification  as  suspect  or quasi-suspect,  courts  might  ask whether the challenged law  or practice was adopted  because  of deliberate  indifference  to the effects  on  a racial  minority  group,  or on women.  If so,  some  appropriately  deferential  form  of proportionality  review  (analogous  to  some  form of intermediate  scrutiny,  sensitive  to the  magni-

elements  were  proposed in  the  scholarly  literature  in  the  decades  after Washington  v.  Davis was decided. 40 2

Experience  elsewhere  has  demonstrated  that  the  burdens  of justification, when significant disparate effects  on a group historically the subject  of  discrimination trigger  heightened  scrutiny,  are not necessarily  fatal  or even  that  difficult to meet.  In the European Court  of  Justice  (now the  Court of  Justice  of the European Union),  violations  of an anti-discrimination  rule may  arise  from facially  neutral  policies  which  have the  "effect"  of treating  women  and  men differently. 40 3 Under  this  quasi-constitutional  standard  for  "indirect  discrimination," 4 * 4 the  European  Court  entertains  challenges to  neutral  employment practices  with disproportionate  adverse impacts on women,  including in evaluating  wage  scales  providing  lower hourly  wages  to part-time  workers  than to full-time  workers, 4 0 5  or in requiring minimum periods  of full-time  work to establish  eligibility for pensions.40 6 In such cases  the European  case law took into tudes  of harmful  as  well  as  beneficial  effects  of the  challenged  law)  could  evauate  whether the practice was justified  notwithstanding its disparate effects. See infra notes 417-418.

402. See, e.g., Karlan, supra note 384,  at 124-30 (arguing  for a broader understanding  of intent, to include  action with knowledge  or reckless  disregard of the  disparate impacts of a law, with a slightly  less  demanding  justification  requirement);  Perry, supra note  382, at 56o (arguing that  disparate impact  should require  analysis  of the degree  of disproportionate  impact,  the public and private interests  at stake,  and the fit of the  statute to its  legitimate  goals, without requiring  either a  "compelling"  government  interest or  the precision of fit contemplated  by the  Court's narrow  tailoring  requirements); see  also Flagg, supra note  384,  at 391-96 (proposing a form of  disparate  impact  review  that would permit the government  to justify polices  with disparate  impact  on  showing less  than "compelling"  interest).  A  common  thread  is an effort  to afford  a  level  of  judicial  scrutiny  greater than  rational basis  and less  than  strict scrutiny to  laws that have disparate impacts based on race. See also Strauss, supra note 382,  at 935 (arguing  that the  discriminatory  intent standard  is  useful  but that Washington v.  Davis erred in making it the exclusive  standard for establishing Equal  Protection violations).

Although  it is true  that Title VII  allows disparate  impact  litigation,  this  statutory  cause  of  action  is  arguably  more  limited  (for example,  by  requirements  that challengers  show  not only  a  disparate impact,  but also linkages  between  the specific  practice  and the alleged  disparate  effect)  than that of the comparable  line  of cases brought under the quasi-constitutional  European Union provisions.

406. Case 170/84, Bilka-Kaufhaus  GmbH v.  Karin Weber  von  Hartz,  1986 E.C.R. 1607.  In Bilka, a  challenge  was  brought  by a  female  part-time  employee  who  argued  that  the  re-

account  that  women  are  disproportionately  part-time  workers  and  required employers to provide specific justifications  for  the exclusion  of part-time workers  from  higher  wages  or  other  benefits;  this  justification  ensured  that  there was  no purpose  of discriminating  against women  and that  the discriminatory effects  were  justified  as  needed  for  legitimate  economic  purposes. 4 7 Once  a disparate impact  on women (over-represented  as part-time workers)  is  proven, the employer  has the burden of showing that the difference  in treatment satisfies the principle  of  proportionality.4 5

In the Danfoss case, 4 0 9 the European  Court held that a criterion of "mobility . . . to reward  the  employee's adaptability  to variable  hours and  varying places of work,"  could "work to  the disadvantage  of female  employees,  who,  because of household  and family  duties  for which  they  are  frequently  responsible,  are not as  able  as  men  to  organize  their  working  time  flexibly." 1 0 The mobility- quirement  amounted  to pay discrimination  based on gender,  since women were  more likely to be part-time  workers.

407. See  Bilka, at 1627-28  (finding  infringement  of EEC Treaty Article 119 by  a "company which excludes  part-time  employees  from  its  occupational  pension  scheme,  where  that exclusion affects  a  far  greater  number of women  than  men, unless  the  [company]  shows that the exclusion  is  based  on objectively justified  factors  unrelated  to  any  discrimination  on  grounds of sex . .. [and]  that  the  measures chosen  by  [the  company]  correspond  to  a  real need  on the  part of the  [business],  are  appropriate  with  a view  to  achieving  the  objectives  pursued and are  necessary  to  that  end";  if such  a  showing is  made,  then  "the fact  that the  measures affect a far greater number  of  women than men is not sufficient to show that they constitute an infringement  of  Article 119").
408. On the  burden  of justification  lying  with  the  employer  once  a  prima  facie  case  of indirect discrimination  is  shown, see Case  C-127/92,  Enderby v.  Frenchay Health Auth., 1993 E.C.R. 1-5535,  which,  like  several other  rulings, has  since been codified in  various Directives. See ELLIS &amp; WATSON, supra note 404, at  158-63.  For reference  to the EU approach as  one of  proportionality,  see A.C.L. DAvIs, PERSPECTIVES  ON LABOUR LAW 134 (2004); FREDMAN, supra note 403, at  180; Evelyn  Ellis, The  Concept of Proportionality  in the European Community Sex  Discrimination  Law, in THE  PRINCIPLE  OF  PROPORTIONALITY  IN  THE  LAWS  OF EUROPE  165,  167 (Evelyn Ellis ed., 1999). The  tests articulated for  implementing  this principle  of  proportionality differ  from those  of the  Canadian Oakes test,  requiring  a legitimate  aim,  and focusing primarily  on the  first two prongs  of "means"  analysis -rationality  (or  "appropriate  with a view to achieving the  objectives pursued")  and necessity  ("necessary  to that end"). See supra note 407 (quoting Bilka). (Some  scholars  argue  that proportionality stricto  sensu comes  into play implicitly in how the two prongs are applied. IAN SMITH &amp; AARON BAKER,  EMPLOYMENT LAW 326 (11th  ed. 2013).) My argument here is not that the Oakes doctrine should be applied to disparate  impact claims  in  the United States,  but rather  that some form of  review, beyond the most  relaxed  forms  of "rational  basis"  review  (and perhaps  drawing in  part from existing U.S.  doctrine or  from proposals  made  by Justices Marshall  and Stevens),  should be  applied to  test the  constitutionality  of laws  with severe disproportionate  impacts  on historically discriminated against groups.

"

related compensation  criterion thus arguably violated the "principle"  of EU law "that men  and women should  receive  equal  pay  for equal  work." 4 1 "  Employers could seek to  "justify the remuneration  of such adaptability  by showing  it is  of importance  for the performance  of specific  tasks  entrusted to  the employee." 4 1 By  contrast,  in  the Cadman case  the  Court  accepted  that  pay  scales  based  on experience  would  ordinarily  be  regarded  as  justified,  rejecting  the  argument that  their disproportionate  effect  on women  would require  further justification (absent  a  showing  that  duration  of experience  was  not  in  fact  job-related  in particular settings). 43 This EU case law suggests  that a disparate  impact  standard,  sensitive  to  the  different  social  and  life  experiences  of women  and  men, can be  applied to existing  laws without undue economic  disruption. 414

To the extent  that equal protection violations  in the United  States were  defined  narrowly to focus on intent because  of  concerns  about the risks of  judicial intrusion  on  the  existing  legal  structure, 4'S experience  elsewhere  with  a  more proportionate,  flexible  set  of inquiries  in equality  cases  suggests  that  the  risk may have been overstated.1 6 Washington v.  Davis led  to a large  gap between  the

414. Cf Linos, supra note 404, at  144  (arguing  that  U.S. fears  that employers  would be forced  to adopt quotas  without  a  "specific  practice"  requirement  under Title VII  "have  not  materialized"  from  EU  requirements  to  justify practices  that disproportonately  affect  women).  Recent  case  law  in  the  European  Court  of Human  Rights  has embraced  "indirect  [effectsbased]  discrimination"  as an appropriate  analytic for claims of discrimination  against Roma children,  under the  European  Convention  on  Human Rights. See D.H.  v.  Czech  Republic, D.H. and Others,  Case 57325/00, 2007-IV Eur.  Ct. H.R.;  Martha Minow, Brown v. Board in the  World:  How  the  Global  Turn  Matters for  School  Reform, Human Rights,  and  Legal Knowledge, 50  SAN  DIEGO L. REv. 1  (2013).
415. The  fear  of  large-scale  invalidation  of  laws  under  strict  scrutiny  plainly  was a  factorthough not the only  one-in Washington v.  Davis. But Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), cannot be so  easily  explained. It  was  decided  after  "intermediate  scrutiny"  for  gender  classifications had been  introduced.  Under  some form  of  proportionality  review compatible  with intermediate  scrutiny,  it should  have been  possible  to say  that the  Massachusetts  scheme  gave  too large a  benefit to the overwhelmingly  male  group of "veterans," who  were  the  object of the statutory  preference,  and imposed  too  high costs  on women,  even in  light  of its  important purpose.  The "proportionality as  such" test enables  a court to  evaluate  the impact of neutral laws with disparate  impacts  and conclude that  the degree  of  preference  is too great,  in light of its  adverse  impact  on a  historically  disadvantaged  group,  even  though  a  lesser degree  of preference  would be justified by the goal of recognizing the special  sacrifices of vetetrans.
416. In addition to  the EU case law discussed  earlier, it bears noting that the equality  provision of Canada's Charter  has  been  interpreted  to prohibit both purposeful  discrimination  and discrimination  in  effect, see,  e.g., Withler v.  Canada  (Att'y  Gen.), 2011 SCC 12,  [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396, 9 35 (Can.),  against  groups  defined  by  specific  characteristics, including age,  gender,

stringent standard of review of facial  or intentional  uses of race and  the lax "rational  basis"  standard  of review  for  laws  having  disparate  impacts  on minorities-a  puzzling  feature  of U.S.  equality  law.  Many  aspects  of contemporary equality law might be thought to be implicated  by this distinction. 41 7

Is  it too late  for U.S. constitutional  equality  law to  reconsider Washington v. Davis, in light  of experience  elsewhere? Perhaps not.41 8 A substantial  disparate impact  on historically discriminated-against  groups could  be  treated  as  raising an inference  of a prohibited motive (including  "deliberate indifference"),  which race,  national  origin,  religion,  physical  or  mental  disability,  and  analogous  characteristics like  marital  status. See,  e.g., Quebec (Att'y Gen.)  v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013]  1 S.C.R. 61  (Can.). Despite  this  extensive  catalogue of constitutionally  protected  classifications,  the  case  law does  not  seem to  have  resulted in unbounded  judicial interference  with legislative decisions. See,  e.g.,  Withler, [2011] 1 S.C.R.  396  (Can.)  (upholding  age-related  reductions  in  certain pension  benefits); Gosselin  v.  Quebec  (Att'y Gen.), 2002 SCC  84, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429 (Can.)  (upholding  an age-based  distinction  in  access  to  welfare  benefits,  accepting  that it was  easier  for younger  people  to find  employment  than  for older  people); cf  Quebec (Att'y Gen.)  v.  A, [2013] 1 S.C.R.  61  (upholding  the  constitutionality  of Quebec  statutes  distinguishing between  those who  are married or  in a  civil  union,  on one  hand, and those  in long term  relationships,  or "de facto"  marriages, with  respect to  statutory obligations  for division of property and support  after dissolution of the  marital relationship,  notwithstanding  claims that  the  scheme  disadvantaged the  financially  weaker  (typically  female) partner);  Newfoundland  (Treasury Bd.) v.  N.A.P.E.  [Nfld. Ass'n of Pub. &amp; Private  Emps.], 2004 SCC 66, [2004] 3  S.C.R. 381 (Can.)  (finding that a violation of Section  15  equality rights, from a  decision  to delay  implementing a pay equity agreement for female workers,  was "demonstrably justified"  under Section i by a severe financial  crisis).

417. The  origin  of the  idea  of "suspect"  classes  was  in  the  historic  misuse  of race  as  a  tool  for prejudice against and  subordination  of  racial minorities; that it  was minorities being harmed lent support to  "representation  reinforcement"  arguments  for strict scrutiny.  It was not until  close  to twenty  years  after Washington v.  Davis that the  original  idea of "suspect" classes  was  fully  and  clearly  converted  into  a  principle  against  "suspect  classifications," Adarand  Constructors,  Inc.  v.  Pena, 515 U.S. 200  (1995), shifting  the  principal  concern  of equality  law from harm  to  members of subordinated  racial  groups  to harm  to anyone based on  a  racial  classification.  A  possible  reconciliation  of Adarand with a change  in doctrine allowing  consideration  of disparate  impacts  on  traditionally  disadvantaged  groups is  discussed infra note 418 and text accompanying  notes 419-422, but space  does not  permit discussion  of the  full  range  of implications  for U.S.  equality  law of making  review  standards more proportionate.
418. Disparate  effects,  identified by  attention  to serious  disproportionalities,  may be sufficient to show  a bad purpose,  but only under a  broader  version  of what counts  as  an  invidious purpose than  required by Feeney, see supra notes  395, 397, 415. Since deciding Washington v.  Davis and Feeney, the U.S. Court has also declared  that "consistency"  requires  that overt uses  of race  claimed  to  burden non-minorities  be  reviewed  under the  same  "strict scrutiny"  standard  applied  to  minorities. See,  e.g.,  Adarand, 515 U.S.  at 224; City  of Richmond  v.  J.A. Croson  Co., 488  U.S.  469,  493-94 (1989) (plurality opinion); id. at 520 (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in the  judgment). Were  the  constitutional  significance  of serious  disparate  impacts  reconsidered,  the  existence  of historic discrimination  against  racial  minorities  provides  some basis  to  think that disparate  impacts  on those  groups  are more  likely to  reflect  bad purpose (if not fully  intended,  then deliberately  indifferent)  than  similar impacts on other groups.

could  be  rebutted  on  a showing  less  stringent  than  "strict  scrutiny"  but  more rigorous  than "rational  basis." 4 ' 9 Although  the Court  now  treats  any overt  use of race  as  subject  to the  same  standard  of review  (whether  challenged  by  majority or minority group  members), there  are arguably constitutionally  relevant differences  between  the intentional use of race to classify persons and the use of neutral  laws that are  "race-consciously" designed toward  some  legitimate end." Disparate  impacts  that  adversely burden  minority  groups  might  be  regarded  as  of greater  constitutional  concern  than  "disparate  impact"  harms  to members of a majority-if not on a substantive theory  of racial nonsubordination then  on  an evidentiary  theory  that such disparate  impacts  are likely  to result from bias,  whether  conscious or  not.**  A more proportionate  approach  to equal  protection  could  allow  courts  to  probe  laws  with  substantial  disparate impacts on racial  minorities  or women  under  the more  flexible  standards  proposed by Justices Marshall and Stevens."

419. See sources  cited supra note 402. A  more  proportionate  approach to  reviewing  equality claims  might also uphold a wider range  of affirmative  action programs,  designed to respond to disadvantages  previously  imposed by  law  on discrete  minority groups  identified by  race. Cf Regents  of  Univ.  of Cal.  v.  Bakke,  438  U.S. 265, 359  (1978)  (Brennan,  White, Marshall, Blackmun, JJ., concurring  in the judgment  in part and dissenting  in part)  (arguing that "racial  classifications  designed to further remedial purposes  'must serve important  governmental  objectives and must be substantially related  to achievement of those objectives,"' a standard between  rational basis  and strict  scrutiny  (quoting  Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313,  317 (1977))). It  is,  however,  possible  that some  members  of the  Court would  place  so  much weight on color-blindness  as a constitutional  value and on potential adverse consequences  of affirmative  programs  that the  standard  of review  would  not  affect  their  view  on the  outcome.
420. See Parents  Involved  in  Cmty.  Sch.  v. Seattle  Sch.  Dist.  No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 748 (2007) (opinion  of Roberts,  C.J.)  ("The  way  to  stop discrimination  on the  basis  of race is  to  stop discriminating  on the  basis of race.").  For at least  one Justice  in the narrow majority,  Justice Kennedy,  it is  the  public use of racial  criteria  to classify  individual  persons,  rather than purposive  consideration given to  race, that is  of most concern. See id. at 782-83,  787-89  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in part  and concurring  in  the judgment)  (indicating  that classifying individual  children  by  race  for  purposes  of school assignment  is  prohibited,  but  that  "race conscious"  but facially  neutral measures  relating,  for example,  to  school district lines is permissible).
421. See supra notes 417-418.
422. Whether such an approach  should extend across equality law cannot be fully addressed here. Allowing  disproportionate  effects  to be considered  through more flexible  standards in  cases involving  poor  welfare  recipients  or  schoolchildren (as  in Dandridge or Rodriguez) might lead to  calls  for greater scrutiny of economic  regulation of  businesses,  arguably at  the core of "Lochnerism."  To  some  extent,  this  may  already  be  happening  through  reliance  on other parts  of the Constitution  (for  example,  under the Takings  Clause with respect  to  land  use regulation);  the  Supreme  Court recently  refused  to  rule  out  the  possibility  of a  "takings" challenge  to permitting  taxes. Koontz  v.  St.  Johns River Water Mgmt.  Dist., 133 S.  Ct.  2586, 2602  (2013) (leaving open whether  and when a "'tax' [could] become[]  'so arbitrary... that it  was  not the  exertion of taxation  but  a confiscation  of property"'  (quoting Brushaber  v.

## 3. Criminal  Sentencing

In  contrast to  the  remedial  challenges  of equality  law  and the  exclusionary rule,  proportionality could  play more  of a role  in criminal  sentencing  without such  complications.4 3 Prior  to  the  enactment  of the Sentencing  Guidelines  in

Union Pac.  R.R. Co.,  24o  U.S. 1, 24-25 (1916))); see also Suzanna  Sherry, Property  Is the New Privacy:  The Coming Constitutional  Revolution, 128  HARv.  L. REV. 1452,  1475  (2015) (reviewing RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL  CONSTITUTION  (2014)) (questioning  the  stability of the bifurcated  approach  to review  of  economic  regulation  as  compared  to regulation of noneconomic  personal  liberties); cf Citizens United  v.  Fed.  Election  Comm'n, 558  U.S. 310  (2010) (treating  the  use of money  in  political  campaigns  as  equivalent  to  "speech"  subject  to  regulation only to  "prevent corruption,"  very  narrowly defined).  The  Court's increasingly aggressive  protection of campaign  spending might  be viewed  as the  Lochnerization  of the  First  Amendment.  For  early  scholarly  discussion,  see  Cass  R.  Sunstein, Free Speeech Now, 59  U.  CHI.  L.  REv. 255,  291  (1992). Moreover,  to the  extent that  the Lochner problem involved  the  Court's basic  economic  theory  of the  Constitution, see,  e.g., Choudhry, supra note 144, at 3,  it would not  be  redressable  at the  level  of  a  trans-substantive  methodological choice  between case-by-case  proportionality or categorical rules.

Some  scholars  have  argued  that  proportionality  review  would  be  a  real  improvement over the kind of "rational  basis"  review,  amounting to  "abdication"  of  judicial  responsibility, found in Williamson v.  Lee  Optical of  Oklahoma, Inc., 348  U.S. 483 (1955). Mathews  &amp; Stone Sweet, supra note 52, at 838-44.  Justice  Marshall's suggestions  that courts  could distinguish the severity of the harm when the rights  of the poor as compared with commercial  enterprises  are  at stake,  and  could also  distinguish  the  likely  need  for judicial  checks  on legislatures on behalf of more and less powerful  groups,  remain salient.  Experience  in Germany suggests that a proportionality  approach  sensitive  to  the nature  of the interests  affected  might  avoid the "Lochner-esque" risks  of undue  judicial  intervention  in  economic  regulation. See KOMMERS &amp; MILLER, supra note 365, at 421,  425-39 (noting  the German  Constitutional  Court's use  of "sliding scale"  and  proportionality-like  criteria  in resolving equal  protection  cases  but doing so through varying "intensity"  of review);  Susanne Baer, Equality: The Jurisprudence  of the  German Constitutional  Court, 5 COLUM. J. EUR. L. 249, 256-57 (1999) (noting  that in  the "field  of economic  legislation,"  including  "mass  administration  of welfare  law,"  the  court "established  a  doctrine  of area-specific  legislative  discretion,"  by  which  "the  Parliament  is given  much  greater  discretion  than in  the  fields of criminal  law,  voting law  and the  law  of qualification  tests"); Edward  J.

Eberle  also  notes that  although  the German  Court applies  more  relaxed review  to socioeconomic  measures,  unlike in  the United  States  the German  Court varies  the  intensity of review even  for  socioeconomic  matters:  review can  be  "quite  intensive,  mainly  when the disparity between  groups  similarly situated is too  large." Id. at 118; see also KOMMERS &amp; MILLER, supra note  365,  at 421 (noting  that in  contrast  to  U.S.  "rational  basis"  review,  which "usually  assumes a  rational  connection  between classification  and  purpose,"  the  German "Constitutional Court  places  a  heavy burden on  the  legislature  to demonstrate  such  a connection," creating an "enhanced rationality review").

423. Federal courts  historically  did  not exercise  appellate  review over the proportionality  of sentences, see Project, Parole  Release Decisionmaking  and the Sentencing Process, 84 YALE L.J. 810,

the 1980s, there  was  very  little appellate  review  of sentences  in the federal system.  Appellate  review  for  compliance  with  the  Guidelines  was  authorized  on appeal by  either the  government  or  the  defendant. Since 2005, when  the Guidelines  ceased  to be  mandatory,  federal  appellate  courts  have  been authorized to  review sentences  for reasonableness.'

The  Court has  repeatedly  considered  the proportionality of death  sentences and held them to be unconstitutional  under the Eighth Amendment  under various  circumstances,  as  when  for  example,  the  crime  was  not  intended  to  and did not result in  death;  but  its  non-capital  case  law  has  been  parsimonious  in reviewing  prison  sentences  under  the  "gross  disproportionality" standard.4 5 Indeed,  the Court's Eighth  Amendment  case  law  on non-capital  sentences  for adult  offenders  is  sparse.  In Weems v.  United States, the first  case  in which  the Court  found  a  punishment  to  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Court  referred to  that Amendment  as  embodying a  "precept  of  justice  that punishment for crime  should be graduated  and proportioned  to offense."', 6  Although some

REv. 1247,  1251  (1997) (noting  that before  the Guidelines,  sentences were  "virtually  unreviewable"),  and thus perhaps did not develop  legal sensibilities  for  identifying  disproportionate sentences.  Under  the 1984 Sentencing  Reform Act's guideline  regime  and until United States v.  Booker,  543 U.S. 220  (2005), federal judges' sentencing  discretion  was  highly constrained, see Am.  Law  Inst.,  Model  Penal  Code:  Sentencing  Report  116 (2003) ("[A]ll  state  guidelines  systems  locate  much greater  sentencing discretion  with  the judiciary  [than  the  Federal  Guidelines]."); appellate  courts  reviewing federal  sentences  focused  on  applications  of the  detailed,  complex, administratively  developed and generally binding "guidelines," see Stith &amp; Cabranes, supra, at 1266-70.

Booker, 543 U.S. 220,  245,  260-65  (2005) (holding  that the Sentencing Guidelines  are  only  advisory  and  contemplating  appellate  review  of federal  sentences  for reasonableness).  On the  history of federal  appellate review  of sentences,  see Note, More than a Formality: The Case  for Meaningful Substantive Reasonableness Review, 127 HARv.  L.  REV. 951,  952-58  (2014).

Louisiana,  554  U.S. 407 (2008) (finding the  death penalty  disproportionate  for the  rape  of a  child), with Rummel v. Estelle,  445 U.S. 263  (1980) (upholding a  life  sentence  for  a defendant  who  was  a  habitual offender  and stole  goods  worth  less  than $300), and Harmelin  v.  Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 1005  (1991) (upholding  a  mandatory  life without  parole  sentence  for possession  of a  substantial  amount  of cocaine,  emphasizing  that the Eighth  Amendment  does not  require proportionality,  it  only  forbids  gross  disproportionality)  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and concurring  in  the judgment), and Ewing v. California,  538  U.S. 11 (2003) (upholding  a  life sentence  for  recidivist  offenses).  Even in capital  sentencing,  the Court has  been  reluctant to conclude  that appellate review  for "proportionality"  in  the  sense  of consistency  with  others convicted  of similar crimes  is required  by the  Eighth Amendment. See Pulley v.  Harris,  465 U.S. 37  (1984)  (rejecting  the  claim that appellate  proportionality review  for consistency  with other sentences is  necessary  for all  death sentences).

Justices  have argued  that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments  Clause bans only particular  methods  of punishment  and  not  excessive  sentences,' 7 majorities since Weems have found that it  does ban severely excessive  sentences.  In Solem v.  Helm, the Court reaffirmed  that the Eighth Amendment  prohibits not only barbaric  punishments, but also punishments  that are disproportionate  to the offense,  holding  unconstitutional  a  life  without  parole sentence  imposed  on  a petty offense recidivist.  In Harmelin  v.  Michigan, a majority of the Court,  three of whose members  emphasized  that the Eighth Amendment  encompassed only "a  narrow  proportionality  principle,"  refused  to  apply Solem to  invalidate  a mandatory life without parole  sentence  for possession of more  than 650 grams of cocaine. 4 9 The case law suggests that while the proportionality of  death  sentences  is  subject  to  serious  scrutiny,  for non-death  sentences  of imprisonment the standard  of "gross  disproportionality"  will  rarely  be  met.  Yet  Canada,  interpreting  a  very similarly  worded  provision  in  its  Charter 4 " and applying its own judge-made  rule of "gross  disproportionality,"  has  taken a harder  look at criminal punishments.  For example,  in R.  v.  Smith, 4 3 1 the Canadian Court held

"[i]f the  penalty were  unreasonably  severe  for a  single  offense,  the constitutional  question might be urged"  if the Eighth  Amendment  had been  assigned  as  error  and were  applicable to  the  government  involved); id. at 339-40 (Field,  J., dissenting) ("The  inhibition  is  directed,  not  only  against  punishments  of the  character  mentioned,  but  against  all  punishments which by  their excessive  length or  severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.  The whole  inhibition  is against  that which  is  excessive  either  in  the bail  required, or  fine imposed,  or punishment  inflicted."); cf Pervear  v.  Massachusetts, 72 U.S.  (5  Wall.) 475, 480  (1867) (noting that the Eighth Amendment does  not apply  to the  states, but going on  to say  in any  event  that  "it appears  from  the  record  that  the  fine and  punishment  in the case before  us was fifty dollars  and imprisonment  at hard labor in  the house  of  correction  for three months.  We perceive nothing excessive,  or cruel,  or  unusual in this").

The Canadian  Supreme Court characterized  the  Canadian  approach  as  more  restrictive  than  the U.S.  case  law at  the  time,  in that only  gross  disproportionality,  not  mere  excessiveness,  could constitute  a  Charter  Section 12 violation.  In  other cases,  the  Canadian  Court has upheld  mandatory  minimum  sentences;  for serious  offenses, see,  for example,  R.  v.  Luxton, [1990]  2 S.C.R. 711 (Can.)

that  a mandatory  minimum of seven years  for all  offenses  involving  the  distribution  of narcotics  was  grossly disproportionate  because  it  applied  regardless of distinctions  in degrees  of  seriousness  of the offense.  The  sentencing practices  of some  foreign  nations, 4 3 international  tribunals, 433 and  some  states," suggest  that  a  more just  and consistent  approach  to  sentencing would  be possible  with greater  attention to the proportionality of the sentence in light of the offense,  the  offender,  and  the  treatment  of comparable  offenses  and offenders.

Judicial  resistance  to  reviewing  sentence  lengths  as  purely  subjective 4 6 is puzzling,  as the  availability of information on  sentences  for comparable  offenses  and  offenders  both  within and  outside  of the jurisdiction provide  objective anchors for  gross  disproportionality  determinations  based on  treatment of  others. 4 37 In  two  recent cases, the  Court  has  drawn  from  its death  penalty  jurisprudence  and more  closely scrutinized juvenile life  sentences.  It has  held that a life  without  parole  sentence  for  non-homicide offenses  violates the  Eighth Amendment  as  applied  to  minors,  because  of their characteristics;  it  also  held that a  mandatory  life  without parole  sentence  for  a homicide  crime  is  impermissible for juveniles,  because  an individualized  sentencing  determination,  like those  required  for adults  in capital cases, is  required  before  imposition  of the most severe  lawful  penalty.43 8 Whether  these cases  foreshadow  a broader willingness to  take a harder look at the  constitutional proportionality  of noncapital sentences  is  uncertain.  Likewise  uncertain  is  whether  federal  courts'  growing familiarity  with  review  of sentences  for  reasonableness  will  contribute  to  further  development of  constitutional standards of  proportionality under  the Eighth Amendment.  There is reason to think,  however,  that both law  and society  would  benefit  from  more  real  attention  to  the  problem  of grossly  disproportionate  prison sentences  than has  occurred to date. 4 "

436. See, e.g., Rummel v.  Estelle, 445 U.S.  263, 275-76 (1980); Note, supra note 424, at 960-61 (describing  the concerns  of some  federal appellate judges). William  Stuntz raised  the  possibility  of "a  proportionality  rule,  requiring  that  the conduct  criminalized  be  serious  enough to justify  the punishment  attached to it," but concluded that a major difficulty would be the absence  of a  "nonarbitrary  way  to  arrive  at  the proper  legal  rules,"  whether  for  reviewing sentences,  or distinguishing traffic  stops from other  crimes  for Fourth Amendment  purposes.  Stuntz, supra note 232, at 66,  73.  Comparisons  with other  sentences  for  similar offenses and  offenders  is  an objective  way  of ensuring one kind  of proportionality;  and while  some comparative  severity judgments may  be  contested,  others  are widely  accepted: intentional violence,  for example,  is  generally  considered  more  severe  than  modest property crime.  Appellate  review  of  criminal sentences in other jurisdiction rebuts claims  of necessary  arbitrariness. See supra notes 431-434

437.  This  point has  been  noted by members  of the Court. See,  e.g., Ewing v. California,  538  U.S. u, 47-52  (2003) (Breyer, J.,  dissenting);  Harmelin v.  Michigan,  5o1 U.S. 957, 1019-20  (1991) (White, J.,  dissenting).

Interestingly,  in Graham, Chief Justice  Roberts  wrote  separately,  arguing  against  any  categorical rule  against sentencing juveniles  to life  without  parole  in  nonhomicide cases but agreeing that  in the particular  factual  context  of the crime,  the  age of  the  fourteen year-old  defendant, and the severity of the sentence  compared to  what both the  prosecutor and probation officer had recommended,  the  sentence  was  unconstitutionally  excessive.  56o  U.S.  at  86-96  (Roberts,  C.J.,  concurring  in  the judgment).  Whether this case  may presage  a willingness  to  look more  carefully  at  proportionality challenges to  prison sentences for  adults  remains  to  be seen.

## C.  Fragile  Rights, Fragile  Regimes

There  may  be  a  distinctive  need  for  prophylactic  rules  either  to  protect  a right  that  is  particularly fragile  or  to  protect  the  performance of particularly sensitive government functions.

It  is  widely  believed  that  some  rights  are  particularly  sensitive  to  threats from the possibilities  of enforcement and accordingly  require prophylactic  protection. 4 4  In the  United States,  First Amendment  rights  of freedom  of speech are understood  to  have this  kind of fragility,  and various  doctrines  have developed,  including  overbreadth,  that constitute  departures  from ordinary  adjudicatory practice."' New  York  Times Co.  v.  Sullivan" 2 can be  understood  in  this way:  perhaps  it  is  not that there  is  a  First Amendment  right to  be negligent  in reporting  adverse  facts  about a  public  official," 3 but  that  there  is a  First Amendment  right to engage  in robust critical  discussion of such public figures. That right might be  threatened if reporters' actions were  adjudicated  under  only a negligence  standard,  and  thus plaintiffs  must show  malice  or reckless  disregard for the truth -as a prophylactic  rule. 4

"

In other areas  the  First Amendment's reach has  been  narrowed by categorical  rules,  arguably reflecting  some form of proportionality  analysis  behind  the rule,  and sometimes  qualified  by further categorical  exceptions  to the  categorical rule.  For example,  the First Amendment  has  been  interpreted  to  allow  stat- paratively  unprecedented.  The  United  States  has  the  highest  incarceration  rates  in  the world,  reaching extraordinary absolute  levels in the most recent two decades.")

utes  that ban  "fighting words."" 5 The  Court explained in R.A.V. v.  City of St. Paul that fighting  words  do  not entirely  lack  expressive  content  but could  be prohibited based on  aspects  of the speech  unrelated to their content that justify the limited  restriction on  speech." 6 (On  the  majority's account,  a  statute singling  out racist forms  of fighting words  fell  within a "content-based" exception to  the  exception  for  fighting  words.)  For the  concurring Justices, prohibiting hateful  fighting  words  posed  little  threat to First Amendment  values  because the "expressive  conduct  ... is  evil  and worthless  in First  Amendment  terms.""' On either rationale, one  can identify  a categorical  rule arguably resting on a relative evaluation  of the  harms from the speech  and the harms from its prohibition.

Scholarly literature  identifies distinctive U.S. doctrine  protecting  "hate speech"  from  punishment  as  an  important aspect  of the U.S. constitutional tradition.4" 8 I  do  not  here address  the correct  constitutional  treatment of hate speech  regulations.

The  Court distinguished the  ordinance from others, like the  statute  specially protecting  the  President  from  threats, see id. at  388  (asserting  that threats only  against  the  President can  be criminalized  because  "the reasons  why  threats of violence  are outside  the  First Amendment . ..  have  special  force  when  applied to  the person of the President"), but without  clarifying  why  that logic  did not uphold  the hate-speech  ordinance. See  id. at 408  (White, J.,  concurring  in  the judgment)  (arguing  that this exception "swallows  the  majority's rule.  Certainly,  it should  apply to  the St.  Paul ordinance,  since  'the reasons why  [fighting  words]  are outside  the  First Amendment . .. have  special  force  when applied  to  [groups that  have historically been subjected to  discrimination]"'  (quoting

and that the ordinance  was  a  "content-based"  or  "viewpoint-based"  regulation of  speech,  with  a Canadian  case analyzing  a similar  issue through  proportionality  analysis.  In R.  v.  Keegstra, the  Canadian  Supreme  Court  upheld  a  statute making it a crime willfully to engage  in public  speech calculated to bring hatred upon a group defined  by race,  color,  ethnicity,  or religion. 5 0 The justices were sharply  divided  on  the  outcome,  but the  majority  and  dissenting  opinions  all applied proportionality  analysis  and  addressed  the  same  questions in the  same sequence.  The  dissenting  opinion,  while  agreeing  with  the  majority  that  the statute  had  a  pressing  and  substantial  objective,  argued  primarily  that  it  did not minimally  impair  free speech  values  (noting the  risks  of its  misapplication and  the severity  of a criminal  sanction),  while  also  questioning  the statute's rationality  and  proportionality  as  such  (noting  its  potential  chilling  effects  and the possibility that criminal prosecutions  would  draw  more  attention and support to the racist views)."' Both majority and dissent in the Canadian  case gave substantial  weight to  the  special  harms  of hateful speech  based on  race or  religion  in ways  that went well beyond  the U.S.  Court's brief mention  of the reprehensibility  of the  cross-burning  in R.A. V. 452 As  the  competing  opinions  in Keegstra suggest,  the  issue  is  one  on which  there  are  powerful  arguments  on both sides.

As  Mark Tushnet  has  suggested,  the U.S.  Court  may be hesitant  to  recognize exceptions  to  the general  rule against content-based  regulation  because  of

451. Id. at 718, 758  (majority opinion); id. at 851-63 (McLachlin,  J.,  dissenting).  Later Canadian case  law  distinguishes  between  exposing  groups  to hatred  and  exposing them  to  ridicule, permitting sanctioning  of  the former but not the  latter. See Sask.  Human Rights  Comm'n v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11,  [2013]  1 S.C.R. 467 (Can.).

452. See Keegstra, [1990] 3  S.C.R. at 718,  758; id. at 861  (McLachlin,  J., dissenting).  By contrast to both the majority  and the  principal  dissent  in Keegstra, see,  e.g., [1990] 3  S.C.R. at  746-47 (Dickson,  C.J.)  ("The derision,  hostility  and abuse  encouraged  by hate  propaganda ... have a severely  negative  impact on the individual's sense of self-worth  and acceptance  [and]  may cause  target group members  to  take drastic  measures  in reaction  .... "); id. at 812 (McLachlin, J.,  dissenting)  ("The evil  of  hate propaganda  is  beyond  doubt. It inflicts pain and indignity upon individuals  who are  members of the group  in question... . [I]t may  threaten social stability."),  the R.A.V. Court failed  to discuss the harms at which the municipal law was aimed until late  in  the opinion,  and did  so only  briefly. See 505  U.S.  at 395-96  (noting  that there  are  compelling  interests  in  assuring  the  basic  human  rights  of discriminated-against groups to  live  in peace  and that burning a  cross in  someone's yard  is  reprehensible,  but  asserting that the state has  other  means  to prohibit it); see also id. at 392. In so doing, it arguably failed adequately to address the reasonable concerns  of those on the losing side. See supra note 228.

a  "fear"  of judgment. 4 3 Courts  cannot,  however,  escape judgment;  they  can sometimes obscure the character of their judgments  through nonpurposive  extensions  of rules,  as  arguably has occurred  in  several areas  of First Amendment law. 454 Structured proportionality  analysis  can  help make  more transparent  the arguments  for and against  recognition  of further categories  of analysis  of First Amendment  claims.  The  Canadian  opinions  suggest  that,  to  the  extent  the First  Amendment  is  construed  to  prohibit  even  narrowly  drawn  hate  speech statutes,  it should not be because such expression  is somehow viewed as having more  value  than obscene  speech,  or fighting  words  in general,  but  because  of the risks of misapplication that such statutes  historically present."

This piece has for the  most part focused on constitutional rights.  But just as prophylactic  rules  are  sometimes  necessary  to  protect  unusually  fragile  rights, prophylactic  rules may also be designed  to protect important government  functions.  Many  such  rules  exist.45 6 Immunity  for judges  from  civil  liability  for their  adjudicatory  acts,  which  is  an  absolute  immunity  under  federal  law,  is famously justified  on the basis  that without it  the costs of defending  nonmeritorious  suits  would be  too  high,  and  fear  of lawsuits  would  threaten  judicial independence. 457 Qualified  immunity  rules  have  been justified  as  necessary  to

- 4ss. Such regulation could  be viewed  as  sufficiently neutral  if it applied to the fomenting  of hatred directed  against  any racial  or religious  group,  not  designed to  favor or protect only  one side  in  racially  charged  conflicts. But see  R.A.V., 505 U.S.  at 391-92 (treating  a hate  speech statute directed at racial and religious  groups as  viewpoint-based because  it did not prohibit hate  speech  against  those  who  preached  tolerance).  There  may,  however,  be  institutional reasons,  not present in Canada,  in the more decentralized  criminal justice and court systems of  the  United  States to limit exceptions  to the presumptive ban on content-based  regulation. See Vicki  C. Jackson, Holistic Interpretation,  Comparative Constitutionalism,  and Fiss-Ian  Freedoms, 58 U. MIAMI L. REV. 265,  316-17 &amp; n.1o8 (2003).

Goff, 12 F.2d 396, 399  (2d  Cit. 1926) ("A  defeated  party  to  a  litigation  may  not  only  think himself wronged,  but may  attribute wrong motives to  the judge whom  he  holds responsible  for his  defeat. ... To allow a judge to be sued in  a civil  action on a complaint  charging the judge's acts were  the result of partiality,  or malice,  or corruption,  would deprive the judges  of  the  protection which  is  regarded as essential  to  judicial  independence."); see  also Gregoire  v.  Biddle, 177 F.2d  579, 581 (2d  Cit. 1949) (Hand,  C.J.)  ("[A]n  official,  who  is  in  fact  guilty  of using  his  powers  to  vent  his spleen  upon  others,  or for  any  other personal  motive  not  connected  with  the public  good, should  not escape  liability  for the  injuries  he  may  so cause;  and,  if it were  possible  in practice  to  confine  such  complaints  to  the guilty,  it  would be  monstrous  to deny  recovery.  The justification  for doing so  is  that  it is  impossible  to  know whether  the claim is  well-founded until  the  case  has  been  tried,  and  that  to  submit  all  officials,  the  innocent  as  well  as  the

protect  officials' ability  to function.45 8 Such general  categorical  rules,  designed to protect the  government's ability  to carry out functions that could be jeopardized  by  intrusive  remedies,  might  well  be  upheld  through  structured  proportionality  analysis  notwithstanding  their  adverse  effects  on  rights-remediation. Consider  these  questions  from  structured  proportionality  analysis:  is  the  goal of protecting  officials  from  the predictable  effects  of suits,  most  of which  are nonmeritorious,  a  substantial  one?  Most  would  say  yes.  Is  the  provision  of a high  degree  of immunity  a  rational  means  towards  doing  so? Plainly  yes.  But do  the  means  "minimally  impair"  the  rights  of those  who  claim  officials  have acted  unlawfully?  This  is  a  closer  question,  depending  on empirical  estimates of the  effects  of different  forms  of protection  that might  shift over time. 459 Finally,  application  of immunity  rules  would probably  be  found proportional  in all but  the most unusual of cases,  because  to freely  make exceptions  would undermine  the protective purpose  of  the  rule.

## CONCLUSION

Embracing  proportionality  as  a  principle  does  not  necessarily  support  its doctrinal use  in  all  areas  of adjudication.4 6 "  Proportionate  justice  concerns guilty,  to  the  burden  of a  trial  and  to  the  inevitable  danger  of its  outcome,  would  dampen the ardor of  all  but the most resolute,  or the  most irresponsible,  in the unflinching discharge of their duties.").  Immunity from  all or most civil  damage actions  is widespread  in constitutional  systems  with independent judiciaries. See generally JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE  IN TRANSITION (Anja Seibert-Fohr  ed., 2012) (exploring elements  of judicial independence  in  several systems).

458. See Scheuer v.  Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232,  239  (1974) (stating  that qualified  immunity  rests  on "the  necessity  of permitting officials  to perform  their  official  functions  free  from  the  threat of suits  for  personal  liability"); see  also Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.  800, 815-19 (1982) (explaining  its departure  from the  "good faith" definition  of immunity  to an "objective"  definition  in  order  to  protect  officials  from burdens  of litigation).  Absolute  immunity  is  even more rule-like,  entirely  insulating  officials  from constitutional  tort actions  related to certain forms  of official  conduct,  such  as  criminal  adjudication  or prosecution. See supra note 457. The Court  in New York  Times  Co.  v.  Sullivan, 376  U.S. 254,  282  (1964), explicitly  invoked Barr  v.  Matteo, 360 U.S. 564 (1959), a  then-recent  case extending  an immunity to civil servants sued for common  law libel.
459. See, e.g., Harlow v.  Fitzgerald,  457 U.S. at 815-19.
460. Proportionality  plays  a role,  both  in the  United  States  and elsewhere,  as an  element  in analyzing constitutional  questions  of federalism. Although  some dormant  commerce clause  cases  can  be  conceptualized  as  about  the rights  of out of state goods,  services,  businesses,  or persons  and  thus  analogous  to  equality  claims,  there  are  dormant  commerce clause  cases that appear  to  be  less  about discrimination  and  more  about burdens. E.g., Bibb v.  Navajo Freight Lines,  Inc.,  359  U.S. 520  (1959). Proportionality  may play a quite  different  role  in these two  kinds  of cases,  and  a  different  role  again  in  measuring  contests  between  central government  and  subnational government  powers.  In  horizontal  structural  issues-in  the U.S.  called  "separation  of powers"-whether  the  concept  of proportionality  has  any  role at

could,  in  some  areas,  lead  to  categorical  rules rather  than  to  contextualized case-by-case determinations. Using  proportionality to  define violations,  of course,  does  not dictate  remedies  or exclude definitions  of rights  based on separate deontological  or historical questions.  However,  greater  use of  proportionality,  as  a  principle  and  as  a  structured  form  of review,  has  several  potential benefits.  It could enhance judicial  reasoning by clarifying justifications  for limitations  on freedoms.  Proportionality  might also  improve  the outcomes  of  adjudication  by bringing  U.S. constitutional  law  closer  to  (admittedly  varied)  U.S. conceptions  of justice,  in  ways  consistent  with  the  demands  of effective  government. Finally, proportionality may be democracy-enhancing, both in providing a  shared  discourse  of  justification  for  action  clamed  to  limit  rights and in providing  more  sensitivity  to  serious  process-deficiencies  reflecting  entrenched  biases  agaist particular  groups.

Justice  Scalia  has  famously  argued  that the  rule  of law  is  a  law  of rules.411 But  sometimes  the  rule  of law  requires  attention  to  the  "reasonableness"  of conduct.  Sometimes  considerations  of degree  will  bear on  the  formulation  of a categorical  rule  in ways  that  the  questions  of proportionality  analysis  can help answer.  If  we  are proportional  in our application  of proportionality,  we may be able  to  improve  much  criticized  areas  of constitutional  law  while  retaining  an important  role  for  presumptive  categorical  rules.  Expanding  existing  proportionality  review  of criminal  sentences  would  bring more justice  to  the criminal justice  system.  In  equality case  law,  the Court's definition of the constitutional right  as  excluding  injuries  to  minorities  from  "disparate  impacts"  of neutral laws  may have resulted from  fear  of applying  the usually  fatal  "strict  scrutiny" test;4 6 2  it might be reconsidered  in light of  case  law from  other jurisdictions  involving  more  proportionate  approaches  to  defining  the violation.  Asking  the "proportionality  as  such"  question  might  clarify  and  strengthen  the  "compelling  interest"  test  used  in  some  First Amendment  areas.  Where  the  Constitution  itself uses  "reasonableness"  as  a criterion,  as  in  the  Fourth  Amendment, embracing proportionality in place of some of the more categorical  existing  approaches  offers  substantial benefits.

Consider Atwater again:  if there  were  no  less  rights-impairing  alternative that  as  effectively advances  legitimate  law  enforcement  interests,  and  if the harm  to  protected  constitutional  rights  were  outweighed  by  the  need  to  advance  those  law  enforcement  interests, then  a  categorical  investigatory rule could  be upheld.  An opinion following the Canadian  approach,  though,  would

all to play would take considerable  reflection. See Jackson, supra note 225, at 843-47 (discussing proportionality  and structural  constitutional  issues).  For  these  reasons,  this paper  has focused primarily on proportionality doctrine in  the adjudication  of individual rights  cases.

take  fuller  account  of the  individual's constitutional  rights  claim  than  did the Atwater Court.  In  so  doing,  the  Canadian  approach  might  well  be  more  convincing than opinions  that focus primarily on authority for the law enforcement action,  rather than the reasons for it.  Unlike  trial  courts' decisions,  police  officers' decisions  made in their  daily  interactions  with  citizens  are  highly unlikely to be  redressable  through the means  of subsequent  review.  Further,  when police  officers  accustomed  to unreviewable  exercises  of discretion  make  unnecessary  arrests  or  commit gratuitous  violence,  the  harm  to  the  subjects  of police abuse as well  as to respect for the rule of law can be high.411

Perhaps the Court's decision in Atwater could be viewed  as a form of  empirical  humility  about  the  presumed  expertise  of police  as  compared  to  courts. Perhaps  it could  be  regarded as  manifesting  respect for democratic  federalism, notwithstanding  case  law  treating authority  under state  law as irrelevant.4 6 4  At the  same time,  given very  high incarceration  rates in the United  States and evidence that  the criminal justice system  falls with greater severity  on  members of already  disadvantaged  groups,465 it is by no  means  clear  that law  enforcement officers  need more,  rather  than less,  insulation from judicial review  of the  constitutionality of their actions.

Where the Constitution itself uses  "reasonableness"  as a  criterion, as  it does in  the  Fourth  Amendment,  the  use  of categorical  rules  that treat  patently  unreasonable  conduct  as  constitutional  does  a  disservice  to  the  rule  of law  and fails  to protect express  constitutional values.4 66 When the Constitution requires the  vindication  of such  large-scale  commitments  as  "equal  protection  of the laws,"  or  "due  process  of law," embracing  a  more  flexible,  proportionalitybased approach  may better protect constitutional justice  than will existing  categorical  approaches, by  offering a  check on  governmental indifference or
